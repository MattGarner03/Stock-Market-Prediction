===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-05 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Realty Income First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelsey Mueller, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kelsey Mueller: Thank you for joining us today for Realty Income's 2025 first quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's filing on Form 10-Q. During the Q&A portion of the call, we will be observing a two question limit. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Kelsey. Welcome, everyone. Realty Income's first quarter results reflect the strength, consistency and resilience of our business model, anchored by a highly diversified global portfolio. Our ability to deliver reliable performance through varying market conditions remains a hallmark of our platform. Overall history we have strategically diversified our business model across client types, asset classes and geographies, an approach that proves to be an increasingly valuable in today's uncertain macroeconomic environment. Our portfolio is comprised of 65% US retail, which includes high quality clients that have demonstrated resilience through economic cycles. To that end, given the strength of our client base and our proactive portfolio management, we expect a negligible portion of our client base to be meaningfully impacted by tariffs, which has already been incorporated into our updated credit assumptions. The diversification and quality of our portfolio, combined with our proven stability as an operator, position us to navigate potential external pressures effectively, as we have consistently done. Moving to the details of the first quarter. We delivered AFFO per share of $1.06 representing a year-over-year growth of 2.9%. This marks a continuation of our long standing track record of positive AFFO per share growth in all but one year over our 30-year history as a public company. This growth combined with our 6% dividend yield resulted in total operational returns of 8.9% for the quarter, underscoring the value of our platform. We leveraged our diverse sourcing avenues to focus investment activity where we saw the most compelling opportunities, notably in Europe. In total, we invested $1.4 billion at a 7.5% weighted average initial cash yield, equating to a spread of 204 basis points over our short-term weighted average cost of capital. Importantly, 72% of our investment volume came from five transactions over $50 million illustrating one of the many ways our size and scale drive value creation. We continue to benefit from a meaningful portfolio discount when competing for high quality net lease investments in the marketplace. In the US, we invested $479 million at an 8. 3% weighted average initial cash yield. And in Europe, which accounted for 65% of total investment volume this quarter, we deployed $893 million at an average initial cash yield of 7%. The region continues to offer compelling opportunities as we scale our business and seek to capitalize on the attractive dynamics of this large fragmented market. Our international presence and capabilities differentiate us from most other net lease platforms. Importantly, it offers us geographic diversification, which helps navigate country specific uncertainties. This expansion into Europe demonstrates how our entrance into new verticals can create immediate value and achieve scalability in a relatively short time. We believe our investments in talent, combined with the portability of our deep access to global capital markets, have enabled us to achieve scale without adding incremental risk to the enterprise. Turning back to the quarter. We continue to deliver strong operational results across our diversified portfolio, which now comprises over 15,600 properties spanning 91 industries and almost 1,600 unique clients. We consider our clients to be well positioned through various economic cycles, given the inherently defensive nature of our top industries including grocery, convenience stores and wholesale clubs. Of our client base, over 34% are investment grade with average rent coverage of 2.9 times. As a reminder, over 90% of our retail rent comes from clients that we consider to offer one or more of the following nondiscretionary goods, low price points or a service oriented component for consumers. Over our long operating history, we have consistently found these types of businesses to be highly resilient during economic downturns. Combined with the significant diversification of our portfolio, we believe this provides investors with relative safety as reflected in our long-term operating results. We ended the quarter with 98.5% portfolio occupancy, approximately 20 basis points below the prior quarter and ahead of the historical median of 98.2% from 2010 to 2024. Our rent recapture rate across 194 leases was 103.9%, with 92% of leasing activity generated from renewals by the existing client. Consistent with our historical experience, these results were accomplished with minimal lease incentives, which totaled less than $700,000 during the quarter on over $46 million of rent of new annual rent signed. And we remained active in our approach to optimizing the portfolio. We sold 55 properties for total net proceeds of $93 million of which $63 million was related to vacant properties. Overall, we believe our results reflect that we are operating from a position of strength as we continue to leverage our structural advantages, including a well-capitalized balance sheet, enhanced liquidity and unmatched scale. These characteristics allow us to stay agile, work to capitalize on opportunities across our addressable market and maintain discipline in our capital allocation decisions. Above all, the platform we have built is a direct reflection of the talent and experience of our dedicated team members. Looking at the balance of 2025, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our expectations despite the current market uncertainties, benefiting from our diversified platform that spans multiple geographies, asset types and funding sources. As such, we're maintaining our outlook for 2025 AFFO per share in the range of $4.22 to $4.28 Consistent with last quarter's update, our 2025 forecast includes the expectation for 75 basis points of potential rent loss, with the majority stemming from properties acquired through prior M&A transactions. There have been no material surprises or incremental headwinds to our business as a result of recent geopolitical uncertainties. And while we remain vigilant, we believe our resilient time tested business model positions us well to navigate potential challenges. Additionally, we remain on track to deploy approximately $4 billion in investments throughout 2025. Given the advantages of our platform, we are well positioned to increase our capital deployment should attractive opportunities materialize. Despite market wide uncertainty, our short-term weighted average cost of capital is actually lower today than it was when we introduced our 2025 investments guidance in late February. Before turning the call over to Jonathan, I'd like to share a brief update on our move into the private capital business, Realty Income's US Core Plus Fund. This initiative represents a natural next step in the evolution of our platform and a strategic opportunity to broaden our capital sources and investment capabilities. We began formal marketing efforts in the first quarter and are pleased by the early interest and positive reception from large, well known institutional investors. We consider this a clear indication that the differentiation of Realty Income's platform, scale and long track record is clearly resonating in the market. We continue to expect this will be a methodical process that will enhance our access to meaningful sources of capital over time. We look forward to updating the market on our progress at the appropriate time. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail.
Jonathan Pong: Thank you, Sumit. Fostering meaningful relationships is core to our ethos as a company and we are grateful for the longstanding support of all of our stakeholders. Before diving into our first quarter financial metrics, I wanted to highlight two announcements we made in April that we believe are a testament to the trust our investors and lenders place in the durability of the franchise. In early April, we successfully closed on a $600 million 10-year unsecured bond offering, which priced at 5.34% semiannual yield to maturity. We are grateful for the sponsorship from a very high quality group of fixed income investors who participated in the transaction, which was well subscribed amidst a volatile and uncertain economic backdrop. Last week, we announced the recast and expansion of our multicurrency unsecured credit facility to a total size of $5.38 billion which compares to our prior facility of $4.25 billion. The facility consists of a $4 billion revolving credit facility for Realty Income, bifurcated equally into $2 billion tranches, which initially mature in 2027 and 2029 respectively. Based on our current A3/A- credit ratings, borrowings will accrue interest at 72.5 basis points over SOFR. In addition, including the recast of $1.38 billion unsecured facility for our US Core Plus Fund, which as Sumit mentioned is in its initial marketing phase. The facility for the fund will be comprised of a $1 billion unsecured revolving line of credit with an initial maturity date in 2029 and a $380 million delayed draw three-year unsecured term loan. Establishing a robust source of liquidity for the fund provides meaningful debt capacity to pursue investment opportunities in the second half of the year. From a balance sheet standpoint, we are well positioned to remain active capital allocators with ample liquidity and modest leverage as we finish the quarter with net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA of 5.4 times. Our fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.7 times remains consistent with the 4.5 times to 4.7 times range delivered over the last two years. Our exposure to variable rate debt remains limited, representing just over 6% of our outstanding debt principal at quarter end. As we look towards the balance of the year, we consider our long-term and permanent capital needs manageable and our liquidity and access to diverse sources of capital to be strong. We are confident in our ability to lean into opportunities should this period of economic uncertainty continue. I would now like to hand it back to Sumit to complete our prepared remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Jonathan. In closing, we remain focused on methodically executing our strategy, supported by a resilient portfolio, strong balance sheet and a talented team across the globe. As the monthly dividend company, we have consistently returned capital to our shareholders throughout our history, underscoring our commitment to delivering predictable, reliable income streams. We are continuing to thoughtfully grow our business and create durable long-term value for our shareholders. I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hi. Thank you. I guess I wanted to ask you a little bit about the activity that you were able to execute on in the first quarter. It looks like the bulk of it was in Europe. Just wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in Europe at this point and maybe how that contrasts with opportunities available in the US?
Sumit Roy: Great question. Thanks, Smedes. So what's very compelling about Europe for us is, obviously the investments we were able to make, 65% of the total volume came from Europe. We are targeting retail parks in the UK as well as in Ireland that made up the bulk of the portfolio. And what was very compelling to us about that particular set of transactions was the fact that the rents that we were underwriting were well below what would be deemed as market rents. And we were getting these assets at replacement at well below replacement cost. And the fact that we are controlling a very wide swath of retail footprint is already starting to manifest itself in calls that we are getting from very large retail operators like Lidl and a few others that are very interested in helping us reposition some of these retail parks and give them a presence to continue to allow them to grow as is their stated objective in these markets. And this backdrop is obviously very favorable for investment purposes for us. And that was the reason why we had the bulk of the investments coming in from Europe. Having said that, we saw plenty of opportunities here in the US. As you probably heard me mentioned, we sourced about $22 billion worth of product and more than 60% of it was here in the US. But when you look at some of the credit that we were being asked to underwrite on the higher yielding side of the curve, we just couldn't get comfortable with the downside risk, the tail risks, if you will on some of those credits. But we are seeing plenty of opportunities. It's finding the right risk adjusted opportunity that's compelling us to invest more in Europe today. And you should kind of expect that to be the run rate for the first half of this year.
Smedes Rose: Okay. And can I just ask you one more thing? You noted that the rent recapture was 103.9%, but on the same-store, the same list of clients, I guess the releasing was down about 50 basis points, but it was offset by other items. Is there anything going on there in your negotiations with the releasing to the same tenants that was driving that down a little bit or is that normal or?
Sumit Roy: No, look, obviously, if you look at the last few quarters, the renewals have been far superior with existing clients. So this is a bit of a one-off, but we tend to look at this in totality. We give you the breakup, so you can see that the vast majority of the renewals does come from existing clients. But I would chalk this off to a one-off, but I believe it was still 99.7%. And the vast majority of the renewals was well north of 100%. But we did have, I want to say, three theater assets, three or four theater assets that dragged it a little bit below the 100% mark, but still a very favorable outcome.
Operator: The next question is from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Yes. Thanks, everybody. Sumit you're 35% of the way to the guidance for the year on investments, and the first quarter is typically one of the lighter quarters too. You obviously left the guidance unchanged. I'm curious is that just reflective of the level of uncertainty right now or was the first quarter just particularly full to how the pipeline looks?
Sumit Roy: That's a great question, Brad. Look, I think we are very cautiously optimistic. What we didn't want to do was try to extrapolate what we have achieved in the first quarter for the remainder of the year. There is a fair amount of uncertainty. There is a lot of transactions in the market as our sourcing volumes would suggest. But it is finding the right deals for us. And given the exogenous factors of a potentially higher interest rate environment for longer and allowing for some of the geopolitical trade driven conditions to play out, we just wanted to be a bit more cautious. So we want to be very deliberate. We want to be very focused on making sure that if we are going to use equity, that we use it in a very appropriate fashion. And so that's the primary reason why we chose to leave the volume numbers unchanged.
Brad Heffern: Okay, got it. And then on the tariff impact, you talked through some of the sectors that you thought would be well inflated. I'm curious, is there anything in the portfolio that you would call out as potentially actually seeing an impact?
Sumit Roy: No, no different than what we had highlighted. I believe it was in February when we were expecting some of these things to play out. I've gone through a list of clients that we felt like were more exposed to what would happen if tariffs were introduced. We feel like that's fully reflected in the numbers that we've shared with you with regards to our guidance, with regards to our bad debt expense. We feel very confident. And I think Zips is a perfect example of a situation where we got 100% renewal and we had a recapture rate of 94.3%, which was slightly better than what we had forecasted out in the at the beginning of the year. So look we feel like we did a good job of underwriting what the potential impact of some of these exogenous factors were into our portfolio. And so we don't expect anything new at this stage.
Operator: The next question is from Ryan Caviola with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Ryan Caviola: Thank you for taking my question. Just on the US Core Plus Fund throughout this sort of economic volatility, do you view this uncertainty as keeping other private buyers out or competition on the sidelines and it's helpful with Realty Income size and scale or how does the private fund work in an environment like this?
Sumit Roy: Brian, thank you. That's actually a very good question. Under normal circumstances, I would say that the backdrop that we are all experiencing today wouldn't be a conducive to raising private capital. But this is where I think we set ourselves apart. I don't know of any other company within our sector that can do what we are doing. And based on all of the conversations that we are having with these potential investors, we feel very optimistic about meeting the objectives that we have for raising capital at a point in time, where for most others, I would say, even on the private side, who have a history of raising private capital, this would be a difficult environment to raise capital. But look we feel very optimistic. We look forward to sharing with you the results later this year. And so far, so good is how I would play it. With respect to and I don't know if that's what you were asking, Ryan, private investors investing in our domain, we've seen a plethora of them coming in and wanting to create a net lease sleeve to their investments. But they also tend to use higher leverage. And one could make the argument that our product lends itself to higher leverage in the private domain. But given the cost of debt and given the elevated interest rate environment, that will continue to impede their ability to make investments in our space. Our investment profile tends to be Core, Core Plus. And so in order for them to generate the kind of returns that they usually try to generate on their equity, this is not a conducive environment for them to invest. So I think for a variety of reasons, it really does lend itself to what we bring to the table, our history, our reputation and we are very hopeful of having a successful raise by the end of the year.
Ryan Caviola: Great. That's it from me. Appreciate it.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Ryan.
Operator: The next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. A couple of quick ones for me. First, I wanted to talk about the balance sheet here a bit and your liquidity. You settled a lot of ATM in the quarter, I think $631 million, $69 million I think is remaining. So curious how you're thinking about the various funding source available to you here and the capital required to meet your full year acquisition guidance? Thanks.
Jonathan Pong: Hey, Haendel. When you look at our guidance of $4 billion on the investments front, you're right, we do have $265 million of outstanding forward equity. We do have about $650 million on a run rate basis of free cash flow which of course is equity like in nature. And so and then debt to finance that remaining call it $2.6 billion and to take care of about $1.3 billion of refis that we have for the rest of the year. That's about $2.2 billion of debt that we'll raise and obviously given the sponsorship that we've been lucky enough to receive from the fixed income investor base, we feel very confident across currencies that we can do that. So the missing element of course is the new public equity that we would have to raise to fill that gap. And so if you do that math, you look at that $750 million to $800 million of new equity that we might have to raise for the balance of the year. However, that doesn't take into account any disposition activity that we might do. So we feel very good about where the balance sheet is and sources and uses of cash from here on feels very, very reasonable and modest in terms of what we need to go out and get from the public markets.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. That's helpful color, John. So one more, maybe on the other end of the quarter, looks like a loan on the development project yields around 10% term just under four years. So maybe some color on who or what you're lending to perhaps the risk profile and then your appetite for perhaps doing more of this type of activity in the near-term? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Good question, Haendel. Yes, this was an opportunistic loan that we've provided to a private global developer in the data center space. This is a data center park that's being developed in Virginia. The ultimate client that we have is one of the large hyperscalers with very high investment grade rating. And our hope is that this will lead to the ultimate ownership or a path to ownership of these assets. And so we are very excited about this relationship. Again, it speaks to who we are, our size and scale and the willingness of these very well established highly reputable private developers to work with us directly.
Operator: The next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey, just two quick ones. If you could just comment a little bit more on the cap rates in the quarter and more importantly just what you see for trends going forward as we go into this uncertain environment?
Sumit Roy: Sure, Ron. So the cap rate that we were able to establish even absent this loan was just slightly north of 7%. I think you should expect cap rates to be in that zip code. And it's largely being driven by a fair amount of the uncertainty that exists, at least in the near-term. Once we have a settling out of what's actually going to impact future capital raising and what does the environment look like from an interest rate environment perspective, you can start to feel you can start to see some pressure potentially on the cap rates. But right now, we were expecting to see that at the beginning of the year, to be very honest, and we have not. And so it's a bit of a wait and see. And as the market becomes clearer around, like I said, where these policies are going to land, I think the cap rate environment is going to be a lot clearer. Having said all of that, this is actually benefiting us in some ways. Our cost of capital has improved throughout the year. And so the fact that cap rates are going to remain in the zip code that I've just mentioned, it allows us to create these outsized spreads, which obviously is a benefit. And it doesn't come without risk, which is why here in the US, we chose not to pursue certain transactions. But I do think that it will help create more opportunities going forward and we look forward to seeing how things settle out.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And then my second question was just strategically as you're thinking about sort of increasing the rent escalators of the entire portfolio. Can you talk about some of those other buckets like gaming, like Europe and like the data centers and just the updated thinking there about getting the overall rent escalators in the portfolio up? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Yes. Again, a great question, Ron. Look, I think the way we are trying to address rent escalators is twofold. One is the organic rent increases that we are targeting and you're exactly right. There are certain asset types, i.e., industrial and data centers that tend to have more inherent rent escalators. But the second is the strategy that I was trying to highlight that we are deploying in Europe, where we are buying assets that we feel has rent that's well below market rent. And we feel like we can capture that mark to market on the rents come renewal times. And so if you see what we've done in Europe for the first quarter, I think the vault was just right around four years. And it is with an intent to capture that upside that we are inheriting or that we are underwriting is another way that we want to grow the top line without necessarily having to rely just on pure investments to drive growth.
Operator: The next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Greg McGinniss: Hey, good afternoon, out there. I just want to dig into the retail parks a bit. Sumit, you mentioned that those were acquired with below market rents and I'm curious what the yield would be once those are at market. And then how much have you invested in retail parks to date? And do you see a ceiling to that investment?
Sumit Roy: To anything in life, Greg, there's going to be ceilings. But I'll tell you, this is something that the team has done a phenomenal job on. And we decided to go after retail parks because we started to see what the sum of the parks analysis was. We were targeting grocery. We were targeting home improvements like B&Q. And we were essentially getting the rest of the parks for next to nothing. That's how it started. And it was at yields that was well north of 8%, even 9%. A couple of factors contributed to that. One was that these assets were being held by institutional investors who are going through a natural capital recycling or their investment time horizon had was coming to an end that created these opportunities for us. Since our initial investment, which I would say was around three years ago, fast forward today, we have seen a massive cap rate compression. And now these same assets are trading in the mid-6s. So there's at least been a 250, 300 basis points of compression from when we initially started buying these assets. And the rents that we were underwriting to are also, based on our initial analysis, anywhere between 5% to 6% below what the current market rents are. The other dynamic that we are starting to see is our ability because we control so much of this retail space, our ability to go to some of these retailers, brand-new retailers, IKEA, I already talked about a little, et cetera. These are names that are coming to us and saying, in order for us to execute on our growth plans, we would like to be in these locations that you now control. And we are having holistic conversations on not only forming these relationships with these growing retailers, but potentially creating a value uplift by having them in our retail parks. And so it's, along with that, I mean, I'm so excited I can keep going. We also have repositioning opportunities with extra land that we have inherited through this strategy. And so these are ways that we are trying to create growth, top line growth by executing on the strategy that we embarked upon three years ago. And it has been super, super successful. I would say in the UK, we are in the middle innings. Seventh, eighth inning of, well, not eighth, but seventh inning of a nine-inning investment cycle in retail parks. But in the rest of Europe, and we're thinking Western Europe for this similar strategy, it's still early days. The only other country where we own retail park is Ireland, where we just did a large portfolio. And again it has similar dynamics. And it's accelerating our relationship with some of these very pristine retailers who want to grow and want to grow in the locations that we now control. And so the value uplift is tremendous.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. Thanks. And as a follow-up, can you just remind us on the potential vacancy risk that you take when acquiring these assets as well as the CapEx needs they may have.
Sumit Roy: Yes. That's a great question. So what we have underwritten is a certain amount of vacancy that comes with not all parks, but a couple of parks that we -- I would say it's 1% to 2% in that zip code of vacancy. If you were to look at all of our retail parks. And that's where you're starting to see when we are renewing either with the existing client or re-leasing to a new client, we are seeing a tremendous amount of uplift. Case in point, last quarter, the first quarter of 2025, we had a positive 7% recapture rate on these vacancies that we have backfilled. And the CapEx involved is not substantially different from what we have been spending here in the US and I think in my prepared remarks, I shared that with you. So we feel very good about the strategy that we've implemented in the UK and now in Ireland. And it's the flow through is tremendous. We were doing the analysis. It has a very similar flow through to a net lease investment circa in the 95%, 96% zip code and that's essentially our EBITDA margin.
Operator: The next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. First question, Sumit, in your prepared remarks, you made a comment about some of the -- some opportunities that you look in the US that you passed because of the tail risk. And so I was just trying to, I was just curious, could you bring that up just to talk about your underwriting process or is that more just to compare the US versus Europe and just the opportunities in either market?
Sumit Roy: It was a combination of both those points, Michael. Obviously, when we are underwriting a particular lease term, you're taking into account the credit exposure to that particular lease and the ability of that operator to pay the rent for the duration of the lease. And if you come to a conclusion that, that duration is going to get disrupted that in and of itself is not a disqualifier as long as we have a very high level of confidence that we are going to be able to backfill that position. But that is not inherent to net lease investing in our opinion. Any disruptions that we underwrite to create a timing delay in recapturing the value and a disruption in the value creation process. And that's really what -- whether it's here in Europe, I mean, here in the US or in Europe, we are trying to figure out what is the total expected return profile for any investment that we are making. And we are pursuing the ones that yield the best outcomes, which, in our case, we are finding them to be in Europe.
Michael Goldsmith: Got it. Thanks for that. And as my follow-up. The occupancy is up 20 basis points, it sounds like you also sold some vacant properties, which include you had decreased exposure to the Family Dollar, Dollar General, Walgreens, CVS in the quarter. So can you just kind of walk through some of the moving pieces of the dispositions and the occupancy stepping down slightly during the period?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Look, we had -- this is very expected. If you see what we had shared, Michael, about where we would come out on occupancy, we had mentioned in the mid 98% zip code that is still our expectation. We did have some outsized vacancies in the first quarter, which we have largely resolved. You talked about Family Dollar and Dollar General. Yes, there were a couple of Family Dollar assets that we did sell vacant. But I'll also share with you that we have 38 Dollar Generals that came up for renewals and we captured over 109% on those renewals. We had about five Dollar Tree, Family Dollar renewals. There too it was over 108.3% or 108.4%. So these businesses are continuing to hold on to their assets and are continuing to perform very well, especially with the backdrop that we are all experiencing. Family Dollar is a bit of a question mark. We'll see how it all settles out. But in terms of Dollar General, Dollar Tree, those are going to continue to do well, in my opinion.
Operator: Next question is from Rich Hightower with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Richard Hightower: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Just a couple for me. I guess sticking to the theme of underwriting for a second, as far as the, maybe the less creditworthy or higher-yielding opportunities that you had foregone in the first quarter and maybe that's kind of the strategy you're sticking to. I mean could you help us understand, is it more related to the industry vertical of those assets? Is it the capital structure of the entity itself. Are they sponsor-backed private equity style deals? Just maybe fill out the picture a little more in that sense, if you don't mind?
Sumit Roy: Sure. Look, it's not any one of those things in isolation, Rich. When you're looking at, for instance, if you're going to look at something in a very discretionary business like entertainment, given the backdrop that one is experiencing, given that discretionary spending may be impacted by higher inflation, higher tariffs, et cetera, and recognizing that a particular operator within the entertainment sector may have a balance sheet that is -- that can't sustain a disruption to the top line that's what will keep us on the sidelines. That is the reason -- one of the main reasons why we try to look for certain characteristics, especially on the retail side, that we've highlighted, nondiscretionary low price point service orientation to their business. And then we go to the next level, which says, okay, which particular sectors fall within these areas. That doesn't mean we won't look at an entertainment opportunity if we are getting paid for it. But if your total return is an 8% and you expect something to happen to this credit in the next four to five years, it's not really 8%. Your expected return is probably going to be in the low-single-digits in a good situation. So those types of assets we've stayed away from even on the industrial side, when we are underwriting a particular industrial asset, and we feel like it is very specifically being used for that particular client. And the client's business is, does not have the safety, the room of safety that one looks for, we are going to stay away from those very specialized build in secondary potentially even tertiary markets. And we saw a lot of those that we could get higher yields on and but it's a fool's errand in my opinion, where if we all we are focused on is in today's yield and not underwriting to what the expected outcome is it's not going to result in a good overall return thesis. So there are -- on the private equity side, there are very good operators that actually come in and improve the operations of the business. We tend to stay away from operators who are pure financial operators, where they lever the business, and they run it very efficiently. They try to extract all of the cash flows. Those are the types of situations that we try to stay away from. But we have private equity operators who actually come in and are very focused on the operations of the business. And those we are far more comfortable with. So it's a variety of factors really.
Richard Hightower: Okay. That's helpful color. And to shift gears for one second, not to put anybody on the spot, but I was hoping for an update on Realty Income's investment in Plenty the, I guess, indoor farming business you announced a couple of years ago. I did notice that they are going through a restructuring. I'm just wondering how much capital is at risk from your balance sheet perspective? And what's the outlook there if you don't mind?
Sumit Roy: Yes. And Rich you're not putting us on the spot. It's a perfectly legitimate question. Look, we feel that Plenty is going to emerge. They are and they will emerge a much stronger company. They had a particular location here in Compton that they walked away from. They needed to go through a bankruptcy process in order to be able to do that. And the main reason for that was that particular asset had -- they were producing leafy greens, which just couldn't get to the margins that they were expecting to get to. Our asset, if you might recall, Rich, has been created to produce strawberries. And today 2 out of the 12 days are in operation and the goal here is to get the remaining 10 days in operation. They already have a takeout agreement with Driscoll. And part of the process of going through a bankruptcy process was to, again, end up with favorable terms et cetera and emerge a much stronger operator, which is what we expect. And we believe that they've also been able to attract a fair amount of private capital from some of their existing investors, i.e., Softbank and a couple of others that want to see this particular business succeed. And so we feel like once they emerge, they're going to be a solid going concern. Having said all of that, let's assume the downside scenario that they don't emerge, which by the way, is not our expectation based on the relationship that we have with them and how they're keeping us in the loop on exactly how the process is unfolding. But if that were to happen, we control a very good piece of land. We have the ability to convert this, albeit with some level of capital spend into a distribution center. It sits right next to an Amazon site. By the way, it also has a lot of power that is coming to this site. So could we consider a data center site, possibly but those are the things that one would start to look into. The capital at risk is circa $40 million. That's all we've invested and that's all we are planning on investing this asset. But the upside potential remains very, very strong.
Operator: The next question is from Jana Galan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Jana Galan: Thank you. Hi. And congrats on a strong start to the year. I'm sorry if I missed it in the supplemental, but can you provide an update of the weighted average and the median EBITDAR to rent ratio on the retail properties? I noticed the format changed a little bit.
Sumit Roy: Yes, Jana, and we'd love to get feedback from you and others on the supplemental, there was a lot of work done, and the idea was to try to make it a lot more user-friendly. We hadn't touched on the design for the last 10, 12 years. And so we try to incorporate a lot of the comments that we received from folks along the way, and this is our attempt at addressing those comments. So would love to get your comments anyway, sorry, I digressed. Coming back to your question, it was 2.9 times is the average rent coverage for our retail assets on the assets that we do get reporting. And it's 2.7 times, I believe, is the median rent coverage. So still very strong despite the environment that we find ourselves in.
Jana Galan: Thank you. And then just jumping to the investment loan that you made. Just curious, given the volatility in the capital markets, do you see more of those types of opportunities that you'd like to lean into?
Sumit Roy: Jana, the idea is that if it allows us to form a relationship, which could then result in us ultimately owning these assets. That is the goal. And we believe that credit is a particular way to make headway in terms of forming relationships as well as finding a path to potentially owning the real estate. We also find that these investments that we are making have – they tend to be over-collateralized with the actual real estate underpinning the collateral for these investments, they get better returns in terms of yield. And we have some level of protection in terms of the duration. And so it does help meet a lot of strategic objectives. And the idea and I think I've said this before is, yes, where it makes sense for us, we will continue to make credit investments to achieve the objectives that I just laid out.
Operator: The next question is from Jay Kornreich with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Jay Kornreich: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow up on -- you mentioned the investment volume leaning towards Europe for the first half of the year. And so I'm curious as you look out towards the second half. I guess what are you anticipating to occur which will open up further opportunities in the US? And do you expect opportunities in Europe to decelerate in the second half or just potentially have a more robust overall investment pipeline?
Sumit Roy: Yes. You're trying to unpack my words, Jay. And look I am very hopeful that given the trend of what is happening to our cost of capital, which is improving. We'll be able to do more here in the US. I'll tell you that of this volume that we sourced in the first quarter there was about $2 billion that the only reason why we chose to pass was because we were not comfortable with the initial spread that we were making on that volume. The pricing was right for that type of product, the metrics from a real estate perspective, were bang on straight. The operator that we had exposure to was one that we've got an existing relationship with, but it was just that initial spread that kept us on the sideline. So that's our hope that as the market stabilizes, our ability to do more here in the US will get enhanced. And I think Europe is on its own track and we are continuing to be very optimistic in terms of what we can achieve there.
Jay Kornreich: I appreciate that. Thank you. And then maybe just one follow-up now. Looking at Europe, are there any kind of next frontier countries or marketplaces that present a significant investment opportunity for you that you're targeting to potentially expand to next?
Sumit Roy: None that we haven't talked about already. I had mentioned Poland as a country that continues to be of interest. Obviously, it's a NATO country. There's a fair amount of investments. It's the second largest GDP growth country in all of Europe. With a lot more of capital in-sourcing going on in Europe, again, this is a phenomenon that we have seen play out over the last couple of months, we expect there to be more opportunities. And for the right opportunities, we are very excited about our ability to grow into Poland at some point. So outside of that I think we are already in six other countries in, well, seven now in Europe outside of the UK. And we just want to establish our footprint even deep, more deeper into these geographies. And I do think it will create opportunities for us given this capital in-sourcing that we are starting to see play out.
Operator: The next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hey, everyone. Just had a quick question on the funds. How are you thinking about the assets that will go into the fund? Do you have a pipeline of deals that you're looking at, any particular asset type? Will you see that with some Realty Income assets, just your latest thoughts?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Wes, I think we had talked about this, but I'll mention it again. Yes, there is a seed portfolio which Realty Income owns 100%. And that's what's going to go to seed the fund. We are not planning to pay down or sell down our interest or being the public shareholders' interest in this seed portfolio. But we are going to use that as a foundation to raise capital that we will then invest in new opportunities. And over time, we own 100% of the fund today. And over time, we will dilute ourselves down. But we will continue to be a meaningful owner in the fund. And that's where the alignment comes in. We genuinely think that the private capital is a complementary form of equity. Today, we have one source of equity. And we've heard our investors loud and clear saying, look, you've got this amazing platform that has the ability to invest a lot of capital. But part of the downside of that is you're constantly in the public market. And so in order to create this alternative, we have decided to go down this path as a complementary form of equity capital that I believe we are the only one within our net lease space that can do that. And so I don't really see a major conflict. I mentioned that the initial yield is something that our public shareholders are very focused on as they should be, but it is of less importance to our private shareholders as long as we are able to meet the overall return profile that we are underwriting to. And so that in itself creates opportunities for us to continue to leverage our existing platform and invest capital and then have a bit of an asset-light model for the public shareholders because without having to raise any public equity, we're able to generate permanent fee income that goes to the benefit of our public shareholders. So that's how I see this playing in the future.
Wes Golladay: Yes. That makes sense. I guess looking at your European deal, this quarter, you got both the high going in yield and then also the big pop later down the road. Could you talk about maybe how you're seeing the unlevered return on that or I guess the stabilized yield on the European assets once you get that mark-to-market?
Sumit Roy: I think that we could get 10.5%, 11% uplift from just the mark-to-market on the cap rate compression and potentially higher than that on being able to mark-to-market the rent, which will take us time. But as these rents start to roll, as we are able to reposition these assets with more pristine retailers I think the value is going to potentially go up even more. And one could make the argument and I'm getting an indication from Neil that we might be about 40% below what the valuation is in terms of when it's fully realized and fully repositioned with the right retail set up, that's the kind of value uplift that we could have on the retail parks.
Operator: The next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi. In terms of driving the top line growth in Europe to recapture mark-to-market, is this a strategy you've had in mind for some time or something you're verbalizing more concretely now?
Sumit Roy: It's always been our strategy, Linda. What we found was what started off as saying, hey, you do the sum of the parts and we're getting this retail parks at a massive discount to what we would be pursuing these clients on a one-off basis. What started off that way, soon morphed into the more lands we started to control, the kind of conversations that we started to have with the retailers who wanted to grow and wanted to grow in our location basically formulated this strategy that we originally had theoretically, but now are starting to see play out. We've had situations where retailers like M&S have come in and have identified assets where they want to go and position themselves. And that in itself will be an immediate uplift in rent as well as in value just given what M&S represents for these locations. So yes initially, it started off as, hey, we're getting great assets at well below replacement cost to this is a strategy we want to be much more aggressive on. And now that we do control the sites that we do, we are starting to see these strategies play out.
Linda Tsai: What percentage of your portfolio are retail parks right now? And then what is the TAM?
Sumit Roy: In Europe, which represents about 10%, actually, it's primarily UK and Ireland, it's about 40%. And in dollar value, it's about $12 billion, $13 billion of total investments that we have, of which I would say between the UK and Ireland, it's about $10 million. And I would say about $4 billion is retail parks in terms of our investment, not in terms of the valuation.
Operator: The next question is from Upal Rana with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Upal Rana: Great. Thank you. Sumit, you mentioned possibly being in a position to increase investment volume and given the ongoing market volatility and the advantage of Realty's platform, are you seeing any market dislocations across larger portfolio transactions that you could potentially take advantage of? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: We're having discussions and look we were able to do one in the fourth quarter of last year. And I do expect that in this environment, this uncertainty continues to play out, more and more people are going to find the sale leaseback product as a positive alternative to the debt markets that's available. And so I think that, that sort of a backdrop could lead to larger transactions. But I just want to be clear Upal, the $4 billion that we've talked about, this is basically our flow business. This does not anticipate any large scale $500 million, $600 million portfolio transactions. If those happen, which we hope does, then that's going to be an uplift to our earnings guidance as well as our acquisitions guidance.
Upal Rana: Okay. Great. That was helpful. And then just on Zips, you mentioned that they were all released and were able to capture 94% of your prior ABR. Could you remind us of your original expectation with Zips and any details on who you released your locations to or if there will be any downtime there? And then are there any other tenants on your watchlist that you want to high or give an update on? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Yes. Upal, just to be clear, we didn't have a single asset that was rejected. All 100% of our assets were -- they basically Zips continue to operate it where we did have -- the reason why it went from 100% to 94.3% was we did negotiate the rent on some of their assets. And that's where it went from 100% to 94.3%. We did not end up having to go and find another client to step in as an operator on these assets. And as part of that, we negotiated higher internal growth on an annual basis. We negotiated a longer-term lease, in aggregate, and are very hopeful of them now having emerged. I believe they emerged last week with a balance sheet that is more conducive to their operations.
Operator: The next question is from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Anthony Paolone: Thanks. First one is just on bad debt. I think last quarter, you said 75 basis points for the year. And so I was wondering kind of what of that you think you've used thus far have visibility on kind of where it all sits?
Jonathan Pong: Yes. Tony, I would say, overall, we're reiterating that 75 basis points for the full year. I think when you look at the footnote of the income statement, you did see that we recognized a little bit over $6 million of bad debt expense in Q1. And so trending a little bit lighter for Q1, but just to stay somewhat conservative, we are taking that original forecast, which includes some unidentified cushion intact.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. And then just on the deal flow. I mean, you kept the $4 billion. The first quarter is obviously a stronger pace that would get you north of $4 billion. Has much changed in terms of the flow and pipeline just in recent weeks or the last couple of months given sort of the macro picture?
Sumit Roy: I wouldn't say anything has changed in recent weeks. We just feel like we don't want to put ourselves in a box where we are extrapolating what we achieved in the first quarter and then find ourselves having to chase deals, which we would never do. We just feel like there is plenty of uncertainty right now, and it is better for us to when we have the signed contracts in place to come to you and say we are increasing our guidance versus increasing our guidance and then pursuing transactions that we expect will unfold. It's just how we've always done it, Anthony. You've been following us for a very long time and I just think it's prudent.
Operator: The next question is from Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Omotayo Okusanya: Yes, good evening. The retail parks, I get everything you guys have said so far about where you see upside on a longer-term basis. But I am curious like could you just talk a little bit about is there a big difference between retail parks in the UK versus kind of traditional big box retail in the US? Because I think that probably the way most of us are thinking about it. And with big box retail everyone is always worried about the intermediation from e-commerce and things of that sort. So is there anything really different about the retail parks in the UK?
Sumit Roy: Yes. I think the biggest difference is the net lease like characteristics of retail parks, Omotayo. If you think about any capital spend that is required, i.e., you want to do striping of the parking lots or lighting or security et cetera. That CapEx discussion happens upfront in any given year. And all of the retailers that are out there who are on that particular retail park agree to sharing in that cost. So the flow-through mechanism that we are seeing in the UK is very similar to what we would experience in a single-tenant asset where the -- obviously the maintenance cost is all borne by the client. The only time it's different is when you have a vacant unit, and you have business rates, et cetera, and that's the leakage. But that's no different than what you would have when you have a vacant unit or a vacant freestanding asset that we have because our client either the lease expired or there was an event and we are having to pay the insurance and the taxes as well as the maintenance of that building. So from that perspective, I think that it is very akin to what we see in the net lease business. That's why you haven't seen much of an impact to our margins given this strategy. Now if you see you mentioned omnichannel. A lot of what we've done is over the last two to three years. So all these concepts that we are exposing ourselves to, including grocery, by the way, have already been experiencing the disruption elements of the omnichannel strategy. I mean the grocers that we have, if you look at the top four, top five grocers, they account for 75% of all Internet-driven grocery expenses. And so these retailers in some ways, have perfected their strategy to embrace omnichannel. Otherwise, they are no longer strong retailers today. And either they are basically surviving on their last leg or they no longer exist. So I don't see that as much of an impact. What we do see is reconfiguring these sites from more discretionary use to nondiscretionary uses. And that's some of the examples that I was sharing with you which will actually result in a valuation uplift as well as rent recapture uplift. So that's really why we are doing this. So it is different in some ways from what you experience here in the US.
Omotayo Okusanya: That's very helpful. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking soon and seeing you at conferences in the coming weeks. Have a good evening.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-25 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day. And welcome to the Realty Income Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelsey Mueller, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Thank you for joining us today for Realty Income.
Kelsey Mueller: 2024 fourth quarter and full year operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Officer, and Jonathan Pong, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's filing on Form 10-Ks. During the Q&A portion of the call, we will be observing a two-question limit. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy. Thank you, Kelsey.
Sumit Roy: Welcome, everyone. In 2024, Realty Income achieved AFFO per share growth of 4.8%, marking our fourteenth consecutive year of growth. This combined with our 5.4% dividend yield for investors resulted in a total operational return of 10.2% for the year. Over our thirty years history as a public company, our annual total operational return has averaged approximately 11%, with no year posting a negative return, as we remain true to our commitment to deliver steady reliable returns to our shareholders. For today's call, we'll move through three key themes that we believe define our ongoing long-term success. First, a proven track record of results and returns. Second, our confidence in continuing to drive growth in our core business over time. And third, the opportunities our platform provides to enter new avenues to generate further value for our shareholders. Moving to our first theme, our proven track record. Our 2024 results are a testament to the platform we have built. One that is able to deliver against a variety of macroeconomic backdrops, underscored by positive AFFO per share increases every year in our thirty-year history as a public company, save one. Throughout the year, we remained disciplined in our capital allocation strategy, investing $3.9 billion at a 7.4% weighted average initial cash yield. We funded these investments with attractively priced capital resulting in a 243 basis points investment spread, exceeding our historical average of 150 basis points. Turning to the details of the fourth quarter. Our differentiated business model and unique competitive advantages continue to support the company's strong results. We delivered fourth quarter AFFO per share of $1.05, representing growth of 4%. In the quarter, we invested $1.7 billion into high-quality opportunities at a 7.1% weighted average initial cash yield, a 7.5% straight-line yield assuming CPI growth of 2%. Within these investments, approximately 57% of the annualized cash income generated was from investment-grade clients. We completed 73 discrete transactions, including six transactions with total considerations over $50 million, with one being over $500 million, which together represented nearly 80% of our investment volume. The range of size of these transactions highlights the unparalleled depth and breadth of our sourcing and acquisition platform. In the US, we invested $1.1 billion at a 6.4% weighted average initial cash yield and weighted average lease term of approximately 14 years. And in Europe, we invested $650 million at an 8.2% weighted average initial cash yield and a weighted average lease term of approximately 7 years. In total, these investments were completed at a spread of 155 basis points over our short-term weighted average cost of capital, supported by approximately $230 million in adjusted funds from operations after dividend payments. Turning to operations, we have built a diversified portfolio of over 15,600 properties with high-quality clients that have proven resilient through various economic cycles and continue to deliver stable returns. This combined with our proven and experienced asset management team saw us deliver another year of great returns. By leveraging the vast amount of proprietary portfolio data we possess, paired with our internal predictive analytic tools, we believe we have strengthened our decision-making and have further enhanced our capabilities as reflected in the fourth quarter results. We ended the quarter with 98.7% portfolio occupancy in line with the prior quarter. Our entry capture rate on 266 lease renewals was 107.4%, generating approximately $52 million in new annualized cash rent. Since 1996, we have successfully resolved over 5,800 expiring leases at a 103% recapture rate. We continue to expand and develop our predictive analytics tool platform, which is an important component in the analysis of acquisitions, and increasingly drive the strategy on dispositions. Through our ongoing capital recycling strategy, we regularly assess our portfolio to identify and optimize growth opportunities. Dispositions, when strategically appropriate, not only enhance the quality of our portfolio but unlock organic sources of capital, allowing us to reinvest in higher quality assets to fuel long-term value growth. To that end, in the fourth quarter, we sold 80 properties for total net proceeds of $138 million, of which $50 million was related to vacant properties. For the full year, we had net proceeds of $589 million from the sale of 294 properties, supporting an increasingly active capital recycling program which we expect to continue in 2025. Moving to our second theme, we remain confident in our ability to continue driving growth in our core business over time. As we look to 2025, we see an attractive pipeline of investment opportunities across a broad scope of property types, industries, and geographies. Based on current investment spreads, and visibility to the deal pipeline, we forecast approximately $4 billion in investment volume for the year. We are well-positioned to increase capital deployment based on transactions we see in the marketplace. For the year, we expect AFFO per share in the range of $4.22 to $4.28, representing 1.4% growth at the midpoint. This outlook incorporates the following assumptions. On the tenant side, our forecast includes a provision for 75 basis points of potential rent loss as well as an impact from the move out of a large office tenant. The majority of these impacts stem from properties acquired through M&A transactions which we underwrote as part of those deals knowing we are well-positioned to maximize real estate value, given our size and scale. These items result in a $0.04 negative effect on AFFO this year, but also represent an opportunity to cycle out of underperforming clients into stronger clients in robust industries. Given favorable market dynamics across retail and industrial real estate, we anticipate strong releasing outcomes with the expectation to recapture rent at a level consistent with our historical leverage. Additionally, in 2024, we recognized $21 million in nonrecurring lease termination fees representing a $0.02 AFFO benefit to 2024 that we do not assume repeats in our current 2025 forecast. And we are within the NetLeaf page. Throughout 2024, we further solidified our position as a trusted real estate partner to the world's leading companies. We strengthened our partnerships through repeat business with long-standing clients and top global names including 7-Eleven, Morrisons, and Carrefour. To that end, in the fourth quarter, we closed a $770 million sale-leaseback transaction with 7-Eleven, which is now our top client at 3.5% of our annualized rent. This transaction showcases our ability to source, underwrite, and close high-quality sale-leasebacks while our size, scale, and relationship-driven approach allow us to absorb large transactions at attractive valuations. This deal marks one of six sale-leaseback transactions with 7-Eleven in our history, a partnership that began almost a decade ago. Another avenue for future growth is our recently announced private capital initiative, an opportunity to further leverage our proven platform to expand our investment opportunities. We look forward to sharing updates on our progress with the fund business as we move through the year. Overall, we believe Realty Income's strategic position, financial discipline, and diversified portfolio continue to provide stability and long-term growth. With that, I would like to turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our financial results in more detail. Thanks, Sumit. 2024 was another year of solid execution across all areas of our business.
Jonathan Pong: And we remain confident that our unique platform and the investments we are making in the team will continue to generate consistently strong operating results. From a balance sheet standpoint, we are well-positioned to remain active capital allocators with ample liquidity and modest leverage as we finish the year with net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA of 5.4 times. Our fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.7 times remains consistent with the 4.5 to 4.7 range delivered in 2023 and 2024. At quarter-end, we held $3.7 billion of liquidity, including $445 million in cash, unsettled forward equity, and unused capacity on our $4.25 billion revolving line of credit. Our exposure to variable rate debt remains limited, representing only 4.2% of our outstanding debt principal at year-end. The consistency of our cash flow and stability of our balance sheet remains a strength of our platform and contributes to our long track record of increases to the monthly dividend. We are proud to remain one of 66 companies in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, for having increased our dividend for thirty consecutive years. Our most recent increase will take effect for the March monthly dividend payment, representing a 1.5% increase of its current monthly dividend at a 4.5% increase over the year-ago period. This is our 129th dividend increase and our 656th consecutive monthly dividend declared since our 1994 listing, and we remain grateful for the long-standing support of our income-oriented shareholders. The scale and depth of our cash flow diversification and the income-oriented nature of our investments result in lower earnings volatility throughout economic cycles and make our platform unique in both the broader real estate industry and the investment market at large. We'd be remiss without also acknowledging the talent, experience, and commitment of almost 500 professionals globally who dedicate themselves to growing and protecting the dividend. In our view, the combination of these features uniquely positions Realty Income to leverage this ecosystem to drive capital partnerships in the years to come. As mentioned in our earnings press release, our board authorized the common stock repurchase program for $2 billion in value. To be clear, we intend for any stock repurchase activity to be leverage neutral as we intend to utilize proceeds from asset dispositions or free cash flow to fund any activity on the program. While we remain confident in our ability to source, underwrite, and close on high-quality investment opportunities at accretive spreads or cost of capital, it seems appropriate for us to have this tool available to deploy capital in an agile manner should the opportunity present itself. I'd now like to hand back to Sumit to complete our prepared remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Jonathan. In closing, our 2024 performance highlights a proven track record of results supported by the stability of our portfolio, our talented and experienced team members, and our strong balance sheet. We aspire to be the real estate partner to the world's leading companies. And the relationships we have built over many years continue to add value to our company, as demonstrated during the fourth quarter. Looking forward, our pipeline remains active and the opportunities to partner with operators who are the best at what they do are encouraging, a testament to the value our company offers. I would now like to open the call for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.
Fereal Grenad: And today's first question comes from Fereal Grenad with BOA. Please go ahead.
Sumit Roy: Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. I first want to ask about your cap rates and expectations going forward and your current line of sight, how are you seeing cap rates trend? And how does that apply to your cost of capital today?
Sumit Roy: Good question, Fereal. I would assume that based on the pipeline that we currently have, that the cap rates are going to be right around where we averaged in 2024.
Fereal Grenad: Okay. Thank you. And also in terms of capital recycling, I'm curious how you're thinking about that. I know end of 2024, you were able to give a little guidance. How much of capital recycling would you see funding your acquisitions going forward? Or if you have any other color to share.
Sumit Roy: Yeah. It's a little early in the year to give complete guidance and visibility on that front, but you can assume for modeling purposes.
Fereal Grenad: Okay. Thank you.
John Kilichowski: And our next question today comes from John Kilichowski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
John Kilichowski: Thank you. Good afternoon. Maybe if we could start on the share repurchase program. I'm curious. What's the threshold for you where those shares or, you know, where your equity becomes a little more attractive than other options for your, you know, your capital. And are any repurchases contemplated in guide?
Sumit Roy: So, John, you know, this is a function of what we are seeing in the market today. If you look at what's happened in the last four months since the Fed started the reduction in rates, in October, we got to our fifty-two-week high at almost $65. Literally within three months, we were down to $51. And with that backdrop where, you know, the fundamentals of our business is not necessarily this is a tool that we feel like we should have. I just want to be super clear that we will only use our free cash flow from operations and disposition proceeds to do buybacks on a leverage-neutral basis. And it is an option that we believe we needed to have for the next three years, which is what our board has sanctioned. In the event we continue to see this level of volatility in the market. At the end of the day, we are investors. And if the best economic decision is to buy the stock back given the volatility that we are experiencing, then that is one that we will choose to do. But the expectation and hope is that we don't have to lean on this tool. But it's one that we felt like we needed to have available to us.
John Kilichowski: Got it. And then maybe if I could just jump to the health of the overall portfolio here looking at the guide. The non-reimbursable expense is picking up a little bit from last year and, you know, your provision for bad debt at seventy-five bps I want to say last year, you were closer to the thirty bp range. I'm curious if these numbers are more a function of conservatism on your part for starting the year or if you're seeing something in the market from your tenants that's making you want to be a little more cautious just as far as tenant credit is concerned.
Jonathan Pong: Hey, John. For your first question, the guidance that we do have is 1.4 to 1.7% for unreimbursed property expenses. That is closer to a new run rate, albeit we do have some assumption there for carry costs associated with vacant properties. And so, you know, we obviously hope to outperform that. We did come towards the lower end of that range for 2024. But I think on the high end, closer to the 1.7, it's really just the unknown associated with how quickly we can offload some of the vacancies. Now as it relates to the bad debt expense, for 2024, we did finish close to fifty basis points in terms of bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue. So the seventy-five is a bit of an uptick. You know, as Sumit mentioned in prepared remarks, there aren't really any surprises. There's a handful of three tenants that comprise the majority of that. And these are primarily tenants that we underwrote as part of prior M&A transactions. So a little bit of conservatism. I think it's just, you know, to get these properties back and in many of these cases, we expect to do quite well on their recapture. There could be some short-term disruption, but I think overall, you know, nothing to be overly concerned about from our perspective.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Greg McGinniss: Hey, good afternoon. The transaction market, from where you stand today, how are you thinking about kind of the split between US versus Europe versus credit investments for the year?
Sumit Roy: Yes. It's too early to tell Greg, but clearly, where we saw opportunities last year for the borders was in Europe and the UK. That's where we did the majority of the transactions. That quickly changed when the cost of capital environment and the markets changed. There were more sellers willing to come to market. Our cost of capital had improved, and we were able to transact transactions at a spread that was acceptable to us for the risk we were inheriting. We ended the year about a fifty-fifty split between international and the US. I will tell you that, you know, sitting here today, that split is probably where we'll end up for the year in 2025, but I do want to caveat it by saying it is a little early. And given where we were literally two months ago, it again goes back to the kind of platform that we have, the pipeline that we were able to generate, and how quickly we were able to generate that pipeline is a testament to what we keep talking about in terms of a very differentiated business model vis-a-vis anybody else out there. And that's what gives us the confidence to have come out with a $4 billion, you know, guidance on the acquisition front. It's a combination of the pipeline that we already have, the visibility that we already have. That's why I was able to answer the question around, you know, cap rates where we think we are going to end up for the year in 2025. And credit investments will certainly be a part and parcel of this makeup, but it won't be disproportionate to, you know, what we have achieved in 2024, it'll be in a similar ZIP code. But that's the visibility that we have today.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. And could you just give us some info in terms of your progress on further investments into Continental Europe, which countries you've kind of moved into as you've built out the team in London and Amsterdam, and what kind of excites you about the opportunities there right now?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. That's a great question, Greg. It is this continued establishment of a very mature and is part of the reason why, you know, our G&A load remains right around where it has been for the last year, year and a half. It's because we are continuing to build out the team in both the UK as well as in Amsterdam. And that is what's going to allow us to continue to scale once the permanent team is in place. So in terms of new geography, there are no new that we have entered into that hasn't been fully disclosed. I think Poland was the last one that we had identified as a market that we wanted to go into. But a lot of what where we invested in the fourth quarter, we're the same market that we already entrenched in. The UK was the majority and Spain was the second country that we had a few investments in the fourth quarter. But, you know, it's the same countries that we already established our footprint in. Decathlon obviously allowed us to expand. The geographies that we were in included Germany and Portugal. But outside of that, France, Italy, Spain, UK, Ireland, and Poland. Those are the countries that we are focused on.
Greg McGinniss: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Brian Caijolo with Green Street. Please go ahead.
Brian Caijolo: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With announcements during the fourth quarter that other REITs are expanding into the private fund space, does this alter your view on competition in that arena and recognizing that those REITs aren't different property sectors, how do you gauge private capital appetite for net lease assets versus other real estate assets?
Sumit Roy: Brian, in some ways, this is a reaffirmation of the strategy that we announced. Look, we pride ourselves in being a very transparent company. We try to talk to our investor base prior to doing anything. And that's what we chose to do during the last quarter announcement. Was to signal to the market that this is a natural extension of the business, which is to tap into the private sources. We believe that we have a place in the core plus arena within this space. It's a perfect entry point for private investors to get into and really leverage a platform that we bring of circa five hundred people that has been maturing over the last fifty-five years. Along with, you know, tools that we've developed. I believe that we have a place. And look, we've just launched our marketing process. The data room is open. We are super excited about this particular area of the business. And the fact that other, you know, operators, very successful operators who are choosing to come into this space is really an affirmation of the strategy that we have laid out. So we feel good. We'll get our share of capital. We'll keep you abreast like we always do of how we are progressing. But we feel like this is such a massive place in terms of just the quantum of capital available that for us to not move into that area, would not allow us to continue to execute some of what we've talked about, which is, you know, diversifying our sources of equity capital. And so far so good.
Brian Caijolo: That's it for me. Thanks for the color.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey, just two quick ones for me. Just going back to the pipeline, just wondering if there's any sort of larger sort of deals in there, or is it all pretty granular maybe if you can comment on sort of the data centers and the gaming verticals and what the activity is looking like there.
Sumit Roy: Great question, Ronald. So look. In the pipeline that we currently have, we don't have a very large transaction, and we define a very large transaction of, you know, $500 million and above. These are, you know, run-of-the-mill, right down the fairway type, you know, opportunities and we are very happy to have built a pretty robust pipeline. In terms of the asset types, you mentioned gaming and you mentioned data centers. I'll take gaming first. Look, gaming is by its very nature, very episodic. We do have a couple of conversations ongoing. You know, there's obviously a lot of interest in your own backyard, Ron, as you know. We'll see how all of that plays out, but we think that that has a very long fuse attached to it in terms of, you know, getting things over the finish line. The data center space is a very interesting space. It's one that we are very excited about. But at the same time, we are incredibly deliberate about who we want to partner with, what are the leases that we want to be exposed to, which markets are we willing to sign up for, and most importantly, who are the operators slash developers that we want to, you know, create a long-term relationship with. We've all seen news of, you know, Microsoft and some other very large hyperscale that's coming out saying they're going to walk away from certain developments, etcetera. Those are the types of things that just continue to make us very diligent in terms of, you know, who we want to ultimately work with. And the discussions that we are having and the ones that we are deciding to forward are the ones that, you know, we feel very confident about in terms of their competency, in terms of their track record. And not borrowed track records, but their actual track record as an institute and their ability to deliver product. Those have become very important in our underwriting process. And at the end of it all, it's the physical real estate, where is it located, you know, who is it being developed for? What is the kind of leases? Because no two leases in the data center space are the same. And obviously, we've learned that through multiple discussions that we've had. So we believe that, you know, cloud services, AI, will continue to drive a lot of the demand for data centers. But we have to be hyper-selective in terms of which ones do we want to invest in and with whom. So that's my thinking on the data center space.
Ronald Kamdem: Really helpful. And then my second one is just on the bad debt guidance of seventy-five basis points. Was there a write-down in the quarter on straight-line rents just as an aside? But the question is really this year just sort of a unique outsized year or is that and should we be expecting that to sort of normalize as you roll the calendar? Or is it sort of a longer a bit of a longer tail as sort of the portfolio that you acquired continues to roll through. Thanks.
Jonathan Pong: Hey, Ron. On your first question, you're right. For the fourth quarter, there was a straight-line rent write-down. It was primarily associated with the three tenants. So it was about an $8 million or so impact. And so that is one reason why the straight line was a little bit lower than our run rate in Q4. As it relates to the go-forward trajectory of that expense load. I think as we get closer towards the midpoint and end of the year, we'll obviously narrow the range a bit. Right now, it's late February and, you know, given that a lot of these potential reserves are concentrated in three tenants that represent about three cents per share potential reserve. You know, we are just having a wide range of outcomes for those. But certainly, as we get more information, I think, you know, we would expect to hopefully bring that down and narrow our conservatism on that.
Ronald Kamdem: That's it for me. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Smedes Rose at Citi. Please go ahead.
Maddie Fargis: Hey, good afternoon. This is Maddie Fargis on for Smedes. Just on the debt side, it looks like you have just under $2 billion of debt maturing in 2025. Can you talk a little bit about your plan to address securities? And then maybe looking ahead, do your debt coming due over the next couple of years as well?
Jonathan Pong: Hey, Matty. You know, we have intentionally staggered our maturities in any given year. That's been very much an intentional process. I think when you look at this year, the $1.9 billion are still coming due, you know, at 4.2%, give or take. Right now, if we were to go out at our US dollar, of financing this is all on a ten-year unsecured basis, you're probably looking around 5.3. In Sterling, it's probably 5.6, and then in euros, perhaps 3.8. So a lot of it is going to depend on the currency in which we refi, but you know, you assume it's dollar pricing and dollar debt, you know, maybe a hundred basis point or so. Headwind. Okay. And, you know, assuming half your convention because maturity date is around the midpoint of the year on average. Perhaps that's a penny of dilution for 2025. Think as we go forward, you know, we've been through many cycles. We've seen a lot of different interest rate environments. We've seen it be a headwind in recent years. We've seen it absolutely be a tailwind a decade before that. And I think having that staggered maturity schedule and having the options, frankly, to tap into three different currencies gives us the flexibility, the optionality, and the ability to be patient to wait for that right bite. So that's how we're going to continue to manage our maturity risk, we also have, of course, a $4.25 billion revolver. That allows us, again, you know, to have ample sources of liquidity so that we don't feel pressure to go out and do a deal on a certain day, week, or quarter.
Maddie Fargis: Great. Thank you. And then just circling back on guidance quickly. Your guidance range for the income tax expense it looks like it comes in higher than full year 2024. Can you talk a little bit about what's maybe driving that increase some puts and takes there?
Jonathan Pong: Sure. So, you know, we've had an active year on the European side. Particularly in the UK. In the UK, you know, we do we are subject to a statutory tax rate. That you know, we've minimized down into around 10, 11% of NOI at this point. And you know, as we built up that European platform and you know, buy properties in the UK, you are gonna start seeing that run rate and income taxes creep up. So we did $66 million income taxes in 2024. And that's really translating kind of that 80 to 90 run rate. And if you look at the Q4, income tax number, you know, that essentially shows what that new quarterly run rate will be. Would emphasize that for every transaction that we bring to investment committee, we are always capturing the impact of income taxes in our underwriting. Both on a short-term basis as well as from a long-term underwritten IRR basis.
Maddie Fargis: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Hey, Rick. Thanks. Sumit, you mentioned in the prepared comments the sale-leaseback was 7.11 in the quarter. I'm assuming that was a relatively low cap rate. So I'm just curious if you could talk about the trade-off there between quality initial spread and those assets potentially fit in better with the private capital vehicle?
Sumit Roy: There's a lot in what you just asked Brad. So I'll try to go through each one. I'm not gonna specifically talk about 7-Eleven's cap rate. But as you know, the entire US transaction that we did, which was about, north of a billion dollars, was at a 6.4 cap rate. And clearly, that dominated, you know, what we did that quarter. And the other point I'm gonna make is we feel very confident that we were able to get this particular portfolio at at least a hundred basis points discount to where these assets trade. If you look at just even in 2024, and you look at the number of assets that 7-Eleven assets, that have a fourteen-year, fifteen-year walt and by the way, you'll get about forty-five transaction hits there. You will see what the average cap rate is. It's in the very low five. And obviously, they range from, you know, the high fours to probably the mid-five. That's the range of where these assets trade. And so look, this is our sixth sale-leaseback with 7-Eleven. They chose to work with us and it's again a testament to what we stand for. So we are very happy about this particular portfolio. You asked the second question or you implied something about would this have been better suited for the fund business. The answer is yes. I don't know about better suited, but it would certainly be just a fine transaction given the overall return profile that this particular transaction has for the fund business, but we are very comfortable with it being on balance sheet. The point I would make is a slightly different one. We sourced about $43 billion worth of transactions in 2024. We did about $3.9 billion in investments in this year. And our belief is that had we, the fund business, up and running, we could have done two extra. Because there were certain transactions we chose to walk away from which checked almost all the boxes except for the initial spread that we need to be able to do things on balance sheet. That is where why we say that the fund business is complementary. It supplements what we are able to do in the on the public side and can truly take advantage of a platform that we've built which is why we are so excited about being able to, you know, raise capital on the private side, and have that act as a complement to, you know, what we have achieved on the public side. Thanks for asking the question.
Brad Heffern: Yes. Thanks for that. And then maybe for Jonathan, on the office move out, you talked about in the prepared comments. First of all, is that the entire $0.04 that you mentioned or was that just a portion of it? And then more broadly, I know it's a small part of the portfolio, but is this the biggest potential surprise in the office portfolio, or is there the potential for more headwinds on that front?
Jonathan Pong: So I wouldn't say it's the $0.04. It was, you know, really concentrated in one asset, but there were a handful. And that impact was more on the one and a half cents range for 2025. As it relates to everything else, you know, keep in mind a lot of the office that we have brought in has come from M&A. We do not see at this junction anything that rises to that level of materiality. We have been tracking this portfolio on this one particular asset for some time, so it didn't come as a surprise. The timing of that happened late in the year, and so the annualized impact that does show up.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Michael Goldsmith. Yes. Go ahead.
Catherine Graves: Hi. This is Catherine Graves on for Michael. Thanks for taking my questions. My first, just a couple of specifics on changes to the portfolio this quarter. You already touched on your thoughts about data centers and then the gaming vertical, but I saw your industrial exposure also increased a bit in the quarter. So just wondering if you can provide any color on opportunities that you're seeing in that space going forward and sort of what the appetite is for investigating further in the industrials vertical.
Sumit Roy: Yeah. Industrial continues to be a focus for the team, and we will continue to look for opportunities to invest in industrial assets. The truth of the matter is that, you know, they trade at levels that we can't always participate in. So the exposure that we are increasing on the industrial side is largely coming from development, expansions, and projects that we have underway with partners who are developing assets for us. That we are leasing out. And so that's the way we are trying to continue to play on the industrial side. But it should come as no surprise when you do see us being able to participate and buy industrial assets that is certainly a focus of ours. And, you know, our asset management team can attest that that's where a lot of the mark to market on the rents are coming in and they're coming in way above what our current rents are, and we create a lot of value doing that. So that will continue to be part and parcel of our business strategy going forward.
Catherine Graves: Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then my second question, given that we could have been in this period of elevated bankruptcies in the US, I'm just wondering if there are any consumer or retail trends that you're particularly paying attention to as you monitor your portfolio as you sort of navigate this period of elevated tenant credit issues. So just wondering your thoughts about that.
Sumit Roy: Yeah. That's a great question. Obviously, there are a lot of things going on. The macro backdrop is not very conducive for especially retailers who have a stretched balance sheet, etcetera. And so we're keeping a very close eye on that. To further exacerbate that situation, we have an uncertainty around, you know, what are the tariffs going to look like? How is that going to impact certain businesses? And, obviously, depending on the type of retail business you have, tariffs can be a big impact or a not so big impact. You know, on the area of media, you know, where you have a lot of consumer goods like televisions, stereos, etcetera. Sixty percent of that tends to come from China. And so if there is a tariff, you know, those retailers that are exposed to that if they are unable to pass through the higher cost, you know, they better have a good balance sheet. Otherwise, it's gonna be difficult for them to absorb that. And so that's the general trend, and I'm just picking on a very, you know, consumer electronics is a very specific example. But you can extrapolate that across all these other sectors. You know, apparel is a big one. You know, China actually exports thirty-four percent of the apparel to the world. Thankfully, in the US, it's only twenty-two, twenty-three percent. So it's not gonna be quite as acute. But those that are disproportionately, you know, exposed to that peak are ones that we are keeping a closer eye on. And those are much more of a thematic element. It's not specific to our portfolio. That we, you know, that we are focused on. The downstream impact of all of this uncertainty is certainly, you know, leads us to be a lot more cautious. That's the reason for our conservatism, if you will, on, you know, being overly aggressive in a year that is clouded with uncertainty.
Catherine Graves: Very helpful. Thank you for the time.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: And the next question today comes from Jay Kornreich with Wedbush. Please go ahead.
Jay Kornreich: Hey, thanks much. Good afternoon. Just starting with going back to the private capital fund, as you've had several additional months to assess how it would take form after initially announcing it, are there any updates you can provide us to the initial size you foresee for it and when you anticipate beginning?
Sumit Roy: Jay, too early to tell. We literally opened the data room last week. We've had a few initial meetings. So far, so good. Like I said, as we progress, we keep you up to speed on how things are progressing. But too early to tell in terms of target size.
Jay Kornreich: Okay. Understood. And then just one more. As we think about funding for this year, let's say you have $92 million of unsettled forward equity, $45 million of cash, they're just, you know, with the guidance showing $4 billion of acquisitions intended for, just would be curious to hear a thought on how you plan to on the acquisition pipeline and if you would raise equity at current trading levels.
Jonathan Pong: Yes, Jay. I think when you look at the combination of cash, cash, and the unsettled forwards, and you also keep in mind that we do have around $850 million of annual free cash flow, you do have equity-like sources of capital that, you know, covers us for close to the first $2 billion of buying power. We also have a disposition program where, as you saw last year, $591 million is a significant increase in our run rate. That also becomes a tool for us to recycle capital. And so when you're left with, you know, that residual funding need, if you will, we made certain assumptions into our forecast and our model in terms of what's that weighted average cost of capital is. And the reason why we came out with a $4 billion number, you know, isn't just a random number. It's a number that, you know, we feel confident in being able to achieve at certain cap rates or yields that allow us to do deals on an accretive basis year one. So I think that's one way of saying that, you know, we index into a current cost of capital maybe even a little more conservative than even that. And we know that on the top line, you know, we are targeting deals and seeing a pipeline of deals where we know we can get acceptable spreads.
Jay Kornreich: They're helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Ravi Baidu with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Ravi Baidu: Hi there. Can you offer some color on tenant credit? Which tenants or categories are currently on your watch list? What are the embedded reserves? And does the seventy-five bit reserve that you mentioned earlier include only known store closures or bankruptcy at this point or any does it include any speculative bankruptcies or shortcrustries? Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Okay. So I'll take your last question. You know, rent losses this year. The seventy-five bips that we've mentioned definitely has general reserves, you know, areas that we just don't know what could go wrong given some of the commentary I've made around the volatility in the macro environment as well as uncertainty around, you know, where some of the policies are gonna go. I would say that there's a fair amount of generous of in there, and there's a fair amount of conservatism. Even on the identified names that Jonathan went through, in terms of, you know, what we actually think the impact will be with those names. So that's the commentary on the, you know, the bad debt expense. In terms of our credit watch list, our credit watch list is right around 4.8% today. And that is slightly higher than the third quarter, again, reflective of what we've already talked about in terms of the uncertainty, etcetera, etcetera. And we are keeping a close eye on that particular watch list, and we will continue to modify it as we go forward. But that is our current understanding of where credit events could happen. And, again, just because something is on the watch list doesn't event. In fact, one of the names came off our credit watch list last year. In the fourth quarter, and there were a few that were added just based on, you know, what we think could happen on the tariff front and which businesses could get impact. That's how the credit watch list has been created.
Ravi Baidu: Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: And the next question comes from Upal Rana with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Upal Rana: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the fourth quarter, you saw the cap rates compress by thirty basis points. Just curious what drove the compression there and what does that tell us about the competition in the transaction market today?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. Upal, I think, look, the comments I made around coming out of the third quarter into the fourth quarter, the Fed starting to reduce rates. There was an expectation of continued reduction. There was an expectation on where some of the interest rates were going to settle out. That obviously pushed the cost of capital higher, and I think all of that allowed potential sellers to come to market. There was a meeting of the reservation price. Those transactions got done. That certainly had a downward pressure on the overall cap rate, but we are talking about twenty basis points from 7.3, 7.4 to 7.1. At the end of the day, but I think the second point you made about competition, there is more and more competition coming on the private side. And these are incredibly large asset managers who are starting to understand the benefits of net lease investing. And for me, that's just an again, an affirmation of a business model that has this profile of delivering steady growth, very predictable, stability, over very long periods of time. And so we welcome the institutionalization of this space and we feel very confident in our ability to continue to leverage a flat. We to lean on relationships that we built on. You know, eighty percent of everything we do is repeat business with repeat clients. That's pretty powerful. You know. And so the fact that all of these clients are coming in, these potential investors are coming into the space is a good thing but we feel like we are very well positioned to take advantage of our fair share.
Upal Rana: Okay. Great. That was helpful. And then I appreciate the items that you highlighted that's impacting AFFO per share in 2025, but curious what needs to happen for you to achieve the high end of your guidance there?
Jonathan Pong: Upal, I think it really comes down to where we end up landing on the reserve side. You know, given that we are expecting seventy-five basis points of rent, and, you know, you can do the math on what that represents. You know, every nine million dollars is a penny. Right, based off of our share count. So it really comes down to that. It also comes down, obviously, to where the ten-year yield is. We know how correlated our stock is. The ten-year one of the most correlated in the S&P. But obviously, getting a little bit of relief on that front that should help our spreads. And I think just frankly, stability in the rate market for, you know, our potential clients and sellers to see that, you know, there is a stabilized market. We know where the rates are going. We feel like there's some stability. In our cost of capital, the volume, you know, will come back in at levels that hopefully finds an equilibrium that allows us to outperform in the $4 billion. I would say it's really just of those two factors and also our ability to, you know, rid ourselves of vacant properties that do have significant carry costs because that is one of the drivers of, you know, our guidance of 1.4 to 1.7% on reimbursed property expense margins.
Sumit Roy: But I think the point that you made about a more stable backdrop, that's a key point for us, you know. Our ability to generate transactions and to source transactions, Upal, is barnard. And if we just have a stable backdrop, and I don't care if the tenure is at a five percent zip code or at a four and a half or a four and a quarter. We just want stability. And once that happens, I think our ability to generate a robust pipeline, we just showed it to you in the last quarter. Of what we can do with a, you know, backdrop that is a bit more stable. And I think that's what we are hoping for. The rest of it will all play itself out. But in terms of driving growth, is one of the biggest drivers.
Upal Rana: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Jason Wang with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jason Wang: Thanks for the question. Development spending was down and development yields were up. Year over year in 2024. Just wondering what drove that how much development is included in guidance this year, and what the underwriting assumptions are for new developments?
Sumit Roy: The reason why, you know, investment yields on development keeps going up, it's really a function of the vintage of when these developments were being originated. And as the older vintage developments are getting delivered, that cap rate, that yields on that development should go up. Because it's much more reflective of, you know, what the market is today versus what it was in 2023 or, you know, early 2023. And so I think that's just a function of, you know, resetting all of our development and some of the most of the development that's closing today were generated maybe a year ago where the markets were already telling you that there's gonna be a fair amount of volatility. So that's the reason for the higher yields. In terms of, you know, the pipeline and how much of this development, you know, is is constitute that. It's gonna be similar to what we did in 2024, you know, development, again, these tend to be repeat businesses with clients that we have a very deep relationship with. And they have chosen to do reverse build to suit or build to suit with us primarily because in this environment, they want somebody with stability, etcetera, and that's that's. And so I think the proportion should be similar to 2024 is how I would underwrite a Jason. And you know, and hopefully, the yield question I've addressed it satisfactorily.
Jason Wang: Yeah. That's helpful. Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alec Feygin with Baird. Please go ahead.
Alec Feygin: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. To follow-up on something that was talked about in the 3Q or maybe 2Q call, but have you guys gotten the space back from the C-store tenant? And if you have, what's the current assumption for what happens to that space that's embedded in guidance?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So, absolutely, we've got our space back. And we are not gonna speak to what continues to happen on the legal front, but we essentially have most of the space back, if not all of the space back. And we are in the midst of and we were already in parallel having discussions with other very established C-store operators, and we are in the midst of getting that over the finish line.
Alec Feygin: Got it. Thank you. That's all for me.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Teo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Teo Okusanya: Yes. Good morning out there. In regards to the tenant watch list and tenant credit in general, could you talk a little bit about how you're looking at that? From the US, the rest of Europe perspective. And then it says Europe constitute any unit or part of that anyway?
Sumit Roy: That's a great question, Teo. Obviously, you know, given the vintage in Europe, there is a lot less contribution from Europe on the watch list. Having said that, there were certain assets we intentionally pursued knowing that some of these clients, and I'll give you two examples, Corporate Ride was one and Homebase was another. That we wanted to get back. And we already had parallel discussions with other clients that wanted that particular location. And so as an asset management active asset management strategy, we pursued assets that had those two particular clients as, you know, in those assets. And the resolution has been pretty remarkable. In terms of when we did get those back and our ability to recapture rents well north of the expiring rents or the in-place rent is the strategy behind why we did it. But those are intentional strategies. Outside of that, we, you know, it's very pristine. And we don't have any names from Europe that happen to be on the watch list.
Teo Okusanya: Gotcha. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.
Sumit Roy: Well, thank you for joining us today. And we appreciate all the questions. We look forward to meeting you in the upcoming conferences. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you. The conference is now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-05 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelsey Mueller, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kelsey Mueller: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call, in order to give everyone, the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Kelsy. Welcome, everyone. Realty Income's third quarter results highlight our continued momentum, disciplined execution and the benefits of our global investment and operating platform. Our value proposition to investors is simple, a real estate partner to the world's leading companies. We've created a defensive and diversified real estate portfolio consisting of top-tier clients to drive stable and predictable cash flow. As a result, we've delivered positive total operational returns each year since becoming a public company 30 years ago, successfully navigating a variety of economic environments. Importantly, as we move through an improving external backdrop helped by a recent rate cut in the U.S., we've started to see a more attractive transaction landscape. Given this, we are pleased to increase our 2024 investment volume guidance to approximately $3.5 billion, underpinned by strong investment activity year-to-date as well as a robust pipeline for the fourth quarter. Concurrently, we are raising the low end of our AFFO per share guidance for the year to a range of $4.17 to $4.21. Despite some recent volatility driven by exogenous factors, we remain confident in our strategic vision and the opportunity ahead. Our investment strategy offers significant opportunities for growth across multiple verticals, including our core of retail and industrial and newer verticals such as data centers and gaming. At the same time, we are making progress towards the establishment of a private capital fund, which I'll touch on later in this call. Turning to the details of the third quarter. We delivered AFFO per share of $1.05, representing a 2.9% growth compared to last year. We invested $740 million into high-quality opportunities at a blended 7.4% initial cash yield or a 7.8% straight-line yield assuming CPI growth of 2%. Of this, $378 million of volume was invested in the U.S. at a 7.4% initial cash yield with a balance of $362 million invested in Europe at a 7.3% initial cash yield. We've seen meaningful improvements in both the U.S. and Europe. Our international markets continue to contribute a greater share of volume relative to prior years with healthy investment activity year-to-date, exemplifying the benefits we achieved by cultivating multiple avenues for growth. In total, we completed 70 discrete transactions, including four transactions over $50 million, which represented nearly 60% of our investment volume, highlighting the breadth of our platform. As I noted, the momentum we are seeing in the transaction market supports increase to this year's investment volume guidance to $3.5 billion. In the third quarter, our organic acquisition activity, which excludes credit investments as well as development spending largely negotiated in prior quarters totaled $594 million or more than double the second quarter's volume. We expect further momentum through the balance of the year, with an implied fourth quarter outlook of approximately $1.3 billion in investments, which is fully funded as we are vigilantly focused on deploying capital into high-quality opportunities that meet our risk-adjusted return requirements. Capital deployed in the third quarter yielded an investment spread of 243 basis points, above our historical average spread of 150 basis points. This spread was supported by $165 million of adjusted free cash flow available after dividend payments to fund investments. These spreads are based on our short-term nominal cost of capital that measures the year one dilution from utilizing external capital and excess free cash flow on a leverage-neutral basis to fund our investment volume. As a reminder, our ultimate investment decisions are based on our long-term weighted average cost of capital, which burdens every dollar of equity with the same cost of equity. Underpinning our increased investment activity of external capital improved by approximately 65 basis points in the third quarter. This compares to the decline in our weighted average initial cash yield of approximately 50 basis points during the quarter. Turning to portfolio operations. We've created a diversified portfolio of more than 15,400 properties with high-quality clients that have proven resilient through various economic cycles and continue to deliver stable returns. In addition, our vast data availability, proprietary predictive analytic tools and insights of our asset management and research teams enhance our ability to anticipate future trends. We finished the quarter with 98.7% occupancy, a 10-basis point decrease from the prior quarter. Our rent recapture rate on the 170 leases we renewed was 105% and totaling approximately $38 million in new annualized cash rent, thanks to the diligent efforts of our team. Separately, we are continuing to lean into dispositions as an additional source of capital. In the third quarter, we sold 92 properties for total net proceeds of $249 million, of which $87 million was related to vacant properties. This brings our year-to-date total to $451 million. For the year, we now expect proceeds of $550 million to $600 million in asset sales. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail.
Jonathan Pong: Thank you, Sumit. We are pleased to deliver over another strong quarter while increasing our investment in AFFO guidance for the year, reflecting continued momentum. Consistent with our investment strategy, we remain disciplined in our balance sheet management. Our strong balance sheet underscored by A3/A- credit ratings and deep access to capital globally continue to represent significant competitive advantages, fueling the opportunity to grow earnings through multiple channels. Our leverage, as measured by net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA was a healthy 5.4x, well within our target ratio or 5.2x including $969 million of unsettled forward equity outstanding as of today. Our fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.6x remains in line with the 4.5 to 4.7x range. We have delivered consistently over the last seven quarters. A focus on derisking our future funding needs was a catalyst behind our two bond offerings during the third quarter, which consisted of a $500 million 30-year U.S. dollar bond offering and an effective semiannual yield to maturity of 5.49% and a dual tranche sterling bond offering that raised £700 million at a weighted average tenor of 11.1 years and a weighted average annual yield maturity of 5.4%. These offerings illustrate the diversity of debt products available to us and the intentionality of our capital diversification philosophy. Our 30-year offering was our first 30-year issuance since 2017, and our public sterling offering was our fifth non-U.S. public bond offering in approximately three years, bringing our foreign denominated outstanding unsecured debt to over $8 billion. We are grateful for the loyal support we have received from the fixed income community as we continue to expand our credit presence globally. At quarter end, we held $5.2 billion of liquidity, including unsettled forward equity, in addition to retaining almost full capacity net of cash available on our $4.25 billion revolving credit facility, only 3.4% of our outstanding debt at the end of the quarter was variable rate in nature, illustrating the financing flexibility we have heading into the end of the year. Access to capital is paramount to the success of our company and our portfolio size, scale, diversification and our trading liquidity in the public markets, have consistently afforded us well all priced capital to grow with large-scale, high-quality investment opportunities. With that said, we strive to demonstrate a proactive forward-looking mindset as we plan, position and evolve our financing strategy for future growth. Over the last few years, we have evaluated additional sources of equity capital beyond the public markets and have recently begun in earnest to build a private capital infrastructure that we believe, over time, will leverage our strengths and expand the breadth of our capital allocation opportunities globally. I would like to hand it back to Sumit to provide additional color. Sumit?
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Jonathan. As we mentioned last year, a natural step in our evolution is to diversify and enlarge our access to equity capital through private markets. We see multiple strategic benefits of entering the private capital business. First, the amount of equity available from private sources far exceeds that, which is available through the public markets we have traditionally accessed. The size of the U.S. private real estate market is approximately $18.8 trillion, 10x larger than the $1.9 trillion of assets owned by public REITs. Thus, private capital controls more than 90% of the U.S. commercial real estate market based on research from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. Creation of a private capital investment platform is expected to provide us with access to a deep pool of institutional capital from investors who may otherwise lack the mandate or ability to invest in real estate securities. Second, access to the alternative source of equity with generally less pricing volatility will give us the opportunity to accelerate the monetization of the scalable and proven investment in operating platform we have built, in turn, supporting our ability to continue delivering value to shareholders. Third, a powerful element of the fund management strategy is the incremental capital-light fee earnings it's anticipated to offer. Base management income earned by managing third-party capital represents a source of recurring and potentially high-growth revenue, which we observed as receiving a premium multiple from the investment community. The vast majority of fees earned would be recurring in nature and generated through open-end perpetual life funds rather than performance-based or transaction-oriented fees. Fourth, the capability of our differentiated business model will allow us to advance this initiative with limited incremental investment while leveraging the collective talent and experience of our top-tier team and platform. We have a long history of underwriting, operating and maximizing the value of our real estate holdings, dating back to our founding in 1969. Leveraging that history, we have harnessed an impressive quantum of property level data to develop our proprietary predictive analytics model to support decision-making. With additional size and scale, these data-driven insights will become increasingly robust and accurate. Together with the expertise of our team, we believe we provide a compelling co-investing platform for investors. Finally, we believe private capital will enable us to source, acquire and manage a large percentage of available market opportunities that we currently acquire for the public vehicle. Overall, our intent is to create and operate an evergreen open-end fund that will manage private capital on behalf of institutional investors, such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations and large insurance companies. To be clear, this structure will be distinct from a typical private equity style closed-end fund that may have a fixed duration or a narrower opportunity set. Importantly, this fund will be designated to target institutional investors. It will not be structured as a non-traded REIT, and we do not intend to market to high net worth or retail investors. Our fund business is expected to follow the same balance sheet and prudent leverage philosophy that Realty Income describes today. We do not anticipate an adverse impact on our balance sheet strength or credit ratings Rather, it will enhance our financial flexibility. Realty Income intends to be a meaningful co-investor in the fund while receiving management and potentially incentive fees generated by operation of the fund. These additional earnings would bolster Realty Income's return on investment while ensuring incentives between public and private investors are aligned. This approach also reinforces our commitment to transparency and shared objectives. In summary, we believe this private capital platform will be complementary and additive to our existing business. We intend to take a thoughtful approach to allocating investment opportunities between realty income and the fund to maximize the returns for our public shareholders, benefiting both our shareholders and private investors. We expect this initiative to enhance our ability to grow our earnings and dividend, expand our addressable market for investments and reduce our reliance on public equity across market cycles when strategically advantageous. We look forward to sharing more information as we progress on launching the fund. In closing, our year-to-date performance has exceeded our expectations, propelled by momentum on the investment front and supported by the stability of our portfolio, consisting of leading clients across the globe. Looking forward, I'm optimistic about the multiple verticals for growth we have cultivated for capital deployment. Importantly, pairing these growth verticals with alternative sources of capital will further accelerate the maturation of our platform. I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from John Kilichowski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
John Kilichowski: Maybe if we could jump to the 3Q acquisition guide -- or excuse me, just the acquisition numbers you put up and then talk about the acquisition guide for 4Q. There was a good bit of cap rate compression. Just curious what's going on in the acquisition market. And then maybe part two of that would be, you have a big step-up in terms of acquisition volumes. I'm curious if you can speak to the potential for maybe a transaction on the large 7-Eleven deal. And then if so, given where we've talked about cap rates being for that deal, is that accretive to your long-term weighted average cost of capital?
Sumit Roy: There's a lot of questions you've asked, John. So let me just take it one at a time. The $740 million that we did in the third quarter at a 7.4% cap rate, you're absolutely right. It is 50 basis points inside of what we did in the second quarter, which was a 7.9% cap, but it is also a function of the cost of capital. If you notice, our cost of capital improved during the third quarter vis-a-vis what we were at the beginning of the year. And that improvement was about 65 basis points. So, despite the 50 basis points of cash yield compression, the fact that our cost of capital has improved by 65 basis points, it was more accretive to do the transactions that we did in the third quarter with the lower cost of capital that we were able to experience versus what we had done in the first half. So, to look at anything in isolation, just based on cap rate or just based on cost of capital, I think may lead you to the wrong conclusion. So, I would request that you take those two pieces in conjunction to figure out what is the true spread that we are being able to cultivate through these investments. The second question that you had was around the $1.3 billion approximately that we are anticipating closing in the fourth quarter. It is true that we have a very healthy pipeline and it is largely a function of what we were experiencing for most of the -- all of the third quarter, say for what's happened over the last week, 1.5 weeks where there's been a lot more volatility on the cost of capital side. But that has allowed us to basically build our pipeline and we have essentially forward funded [Technical Difficulty] in the public markets to help finance what we are planning on achieving with regards to our fourth quarter numbers. The volatility in the cost of capital is something that we always take into account when we are looking at potential opportunities and making sure that we have enough margin of safety in any particular transaction that we pursue is critical to how we think about making investments. And long term, making sure that our hurdle rates on the long-term cost of capital is superseded by, again, a healthy margin is inherently important to what we do. I'm not going to go into specifics around what transactions make up the fourth quarter. But we've heard certain comments around there being a difference in when you're buying a large portfolio versus the one-off market. I can assure you that we are in the one-off market every day. And just because you mentioned 7-Eleven, there are 35 transactions that have taken place in 2024 year-to-date and with the same approximate lease term, et cetera, if you look at where they traded, they traded at a 5 to 9 cap rate. Anytime we are pursuing a portfolio deal and there were large -- four large portfolio deals that we were able to accomplish in the third quarter, we make sure that it is at a discount to what we would be able to find in the one-off market. And that has played out, if you look at what our, the actual rent is compared to market rent that we bought, the $740 million. The rent that is inherent in that $740 million of investments is 6% below market and 26% below replacement costs. That is why we feel very confident that on a risk-adjusted basis, the transactions that we are pursuing are ones that will create long-term value for our investors.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Greg McGinniss: Sumit, although you mentioned an improving acquisition environment benefiting full year investments based on this foray into private capital market equity raising, it seems like kind of inherently saying the limiting factor on acquisition volume this year has been capital raising and not lack of sourcing investments at widened up spreads. Do you expect the cost of equity in the fund business is going to be lower? And how well investment philosophies between the fund and core business differ to avoid any potential conflicts of interest when determining where an investment should be placed?
Sumit Roy: That's a very good question, Greg. The biggest difference between the private markets and the public markets that I can point to is this focus on first year spread versus a focus on long-term IRR. When we are looking at a particular transaction that is inside of our historical spreads, which has been 150 basis points, we hesitate to pursue that transaction because it is not in line with what we can generate in the first year. And as you know, better than most, that we are valued off of that initial spread that we are able to capture, which then translates into AFFO per share growth. But that does not allow us to pursue transactions that have a similar, potentially even a higher total return profile given the inherent growth, et cetera, that they might have despite having a much lower initial cash cap rate. That is where we feel like being able to access private capital that has similar expectations on the long-term horizon, the return horizon that we have -- we focus on even as a standalone public entity, but not with that short-term focus, as acutely as the public entity does, will allow us to expand our sandbox and make investments alongside this private capital business, to take advantage of much higher growth rate opportunities, but potentially at a lower initial yield. So, we think of this as truly complementary to our business. Go ahead. Were you going to ask something else?
Greg McGinniss: Yes. I just was hoping you might be able to give us maybe some examples as to types of investments or tenants that you guys have had to pass up on because of current structure versus what this this new type of equity capital will allow you to pursue?
Sumit Roy: Sure. Industrial is a perfect example. We've looked at opportunities in the 5.5 ZIP code. We cannot go there today, as based on where our cost of capital is, with 3% growth, 20-year leases. You do the math and you're going to have a return profile, that is very much in line with what we're looking for long term, but we can't pursue that particular transaction because of what the -- maybe not the dilution, but the non-spread day one, that's a perfect example. There are other asset types. Data centers being a perfect example of another asset type that is going to fall squarely in this bucket, which we may not be able to pursue currently given our cost of capital. And that is a particular area of the business that we believe can help drive earnings growth for the public entity in years to come.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Yes. So, it sounds like really the target for the fund would be just a lower cap rate opportunity set. I'm curious, do you expect that there would be any overlap in the investment profiles between the two vehicles?
Sumit Roy: Of course, we are going to continue to be a very large equity holder in the fund. So, our interests are going to be perfectly aligned. So, there will be a lot of opportunities that we are going to be looking at, which actually works for both entities long term, but potentially in the short term does not work for the stand-alone public entity. But this is also going to be a function of the capital raising. We are not going to be buying things into the farm that we would never have touched even taking the long-term return profile into account as a public entity. So, this is truly to enhance the box and to pursuit transactions, assuming our capital raising is successful, and participate together through the fund structure. That is how we would like to deploy capital.
Brad Heffern: Okay. And then, do you have any sort of target in mind for a size where it makes sense, given just the added complication?
Sumit Roy: I hope it's going to be very simple. What causes added complication. Well, it's a different pocket of capital, but unlike pockets of capital that have finite life, this is a perpetual vehicle. And we are going to be very large co-investors in this perpetual vehicle. And for all intents and purposes, it will be fully consolidated with our financial statements. So, you will have perfect visibility. The fact that we have scale and the fact that we have a platform that we are very proud of, unfortunately, does not get valued at points in time by the public markets. And this is a way for us to monetize this platform and, therefore, incur very little incremental cost to stand up this vehicle. That, too, is a value that our current platform is going to bring. And I might go so far as to say that given our size and scale, which we have talked about being such a massive advantage, this is one of the ways that we can show that to the market.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: I wanted to ask a little bit about the $63 million charge in the quarter related to convenience store client. Is that related to the same client where you took some smaller charges in the first half of the year? And could you maybe just talk a little bit more about kind of what the outcome be there? I guess you can't name the client, but maybe just a little more color around what's going on there?
Jonathan Pong: First of all, I'd say we absolutely expect a fair welcome. We've talked historically about situations where we've had credit issues in the portfolio, we've recouped north of 80% of rent that's been impacted. As it relates to the accounting that drove the $64 million charge, it's noncash first and foremost, it really has to do with the fact that upon the allocation of the original purchase price. You've got land, you've got building and then you've got the intangible, which is meant to account for the future cash flows inherent in the lease. And so, the reserve that you see, which rolls into impairment, but is classified because these were originally sale leasebacks as a financing receivable. And that's really just a difference in nomenclature and that's why it's excluded from AFFO is noncash. And we've already expensively accounted for all of the lost rent for the entire of 2024 that's built into our guidance.
Sumit Roy: And I'll just add it to that just because we're talking about credit, let me just share a bit more. I mean these are assets that we really want to one control over. And we are doing everything in our power to get control of this asset. It is essentially a client who's decided not to pay rent while operating these assets. And given the work that the asset management team has done, we already have a tremendous amount of interest in these assets, which are primarily located in Texas. And so, we feel very confident about being able to replace the rent, which is not significant in this case. The actual cash rent that is very quickly once we gain control. So that's this convenience store operator. But while we are on the topic of credit, I want to walk you through some of what has dominated the conversations over the last few quarters. Red Lobster has emerged from bankruptcy and just hired a CEO. They've hired a Chief Marketing Officer. They've got a new CFO. Let me close the storyline on that. We had 216 assets, pre-bankruptcy. Nine assets were rejected through bankruptcy. We had a 91% recapture rate on that particular name. Rite Aid. We have 29 locations today. We had an 88% recapture rate on Rite Aid, which is now emerged from bankruptcy and is an ongoing concern. Regal, where we have 35 assets today and an 85% recapture rate and it has emerged from bankruptcy. So those are the story lines that have dominated multiple quarters of conversations, and this is the end result of all of those conversations. Let's talk about Walgreens. Everybody is concerned about what used to be a 2,000 store closings, which has now been reduced to 1,500. Year-to-date, we've had 13 Walgreens come up for renewal. They had lease maturity. All 13 were renewed by Walgreens. In our history of 55 renewals with Walgreens, we've had a recapture rate of over 100%. Let's throw CVS in that mix. We've had 40 leases renew with CVS in our history at over 102% renewal. Let's talk about Family Dollar, Dollar Tree. We've had 135 lease renewals with Family Dollar, Dollar Tree in our history at over 108% renewal rate. Dollar General is a similar story. So, I just asked that what we see in the headlines don't necessarily translate to what is happening on the ground for our portfolio. And that's the emphasis I want to make is that we are very selective and the data proves that out to be the case. Go ahead, Smedes. Sorry, I cut you off.
Smedes Rose: No. No. I mean I appreciate the detail is understood. But of course, as we see these headlines, we have to ask about them, right? I mean that's the nature of the business. I wanted to ask you on the -- just going back to the fund for a moment. You -- I think it was asked previously, but I don't think I heard the answer. Just do you have a sense of kind of what the scope of the fund would be? And are we talking maybe $1 billion to start? Or would you see it in several billions? Or kind of how do you think about the size of the fund, I guess, initially and maybe how it might grow over time?
Sumit Roy: Yes. It's too early to tell. We obviously believe in our pieces. We believe in what we are doing. We believe it's -- the benefits of what we are doing is going to accrue to our public shareholders, but it is too early Smedes me to opine on how big this could potentially become.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Jay Kornreich with SMBC. Please go ahead.
Jay Kornreich: I was wondering if you can comment on kind of the opportunities that you're currently seeing in Europe? And as you see things today, are you looking into exploring into new territories and do you expect that acquisition opportunity in Europe to continue to outpace the U.S.?
Sumit Roy: That's a great question, Jay, given what we've done in the quarters, it is a legitimate question. Yes, 56% of what we've done year-to-date has been in Europe, but we view that as an advantage that's precisely the reason why we created all of these growth verticals to be able to take advantage of wherever the best opportunities reside. And Europe is where we found that to be the case for the first three quarters. I believe the momentum in Europe will continue. We are seeing very good opportunities in Europe. And yes, our ability to go beyond our current geography, by geography, I mean, countries in Europe is also something that we are constantly looking. And so, for the right opportunity, there are several countries that we don't happen to be in that we would consider going into with the right client and with the right opportunity. Jay had asked about the future as well. And so, the $1.3 billion that's expected in the fourth quarter, I want to close a loop on that. The momentum that I had referenced was the momentum that we are seeing here in the U.S. In Europe, the momentum has continued. It's been there at the beginning of the year. That momentum has continued, but it's in the fourth quarter that you will see it reverting back to more historical norms in terms of U.S. versus international.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Sumit, I wanted to go back to the fund one more time. There appears to be a long list of benefits that you mentioned already, but I'm also thinking that there could be a long-term benefit of allowing you at some point to potentially generate mid-single-digit AFFO growth, your long-term kind of core growth target without the need for sizable annual equity raises when you think about your existing rent bumps and the reinvestment of your free cash flow. So, I guess, first, is that fair? And then maybe some color on if you'd look to fund it with existing assets within your portfolio and what that mix could look like?
Sumit Roy: That's a very good question, Haendel. Thank you. And you're right. I mean, the idea here is we get into this business to expand the investable universe for ourselves and for the fund while making sure that we adhere to the return expectations of all parties concerned. Look, it's a mathematical fact that it's not an issue today, but 10 years from now, at the rate we are growing, if we continue to rely on just the public markets to finance our growth, we're going to run up into capacity issues. I don't believe that the public markets are, especially the fund business in the public markets are growing at the same level that we have expectations of growing as a public entity. And so, it is not a dearth of opportunities that is driving this desire to get into the fund business. it is making sure that this complementary source of equity capital will help us monetize our platform and create a business that will then allow us to continue the momentum that we have shown over the last 55 years, 30 of which has been as a public entity. That is the goal of what we are trying to do. And outside of the initial call it, seating of this fund, which, by the way, that portfolio will look and feel very similar to what Realty income looks like. And at the appropriate time, all of that will get disclosed, is a way to attract capital and start our business. But subsequently, it will be new transactions that they participate in, either alongside us or it will be on balance sheet for the public entity. That's how the business is going to function.
Haendel St. Juste: No, that's incremental. I appreciate that. And one more, and I'm not sure if you answered it, but I didn't quite catch if the pipeline for the fourth quarter, if you expect the cap rates to be comparable or lower? And then just thinking about the uptick in volume into the fourth quarter, if that's an appropriate run rate to think about into next year?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Haendel, I'm not going to opine on cap rates, et cetera, because things can move around quite a bit. But what I will tell you is that the spread that we are going to make will be -- will continue to be healthy and will continue to be north of our historical spreads. That you can take a fair amount of confidence. And the other piece I'll leave you with Haendel is, we have already prefunded our need for the fourth quarter. So, there is no reliance on the public markets to help fund this $1.3 billion that we are planning on doing in the fourth quarter. Hopefully, that helps.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Spenser Allaway: One more on the private fund. Can you maybe just talk about how time will be spent just in terms of underwriting deals and opportunities for the team in general, but also for you, Sumit. And then I know you commented on economies of scale around our data and data analytics. But just curious, if you foresee any changes to headcount or to the investment process just in the early stages of that launch?
Sumit Roy: That's a great question, Spenser, because it really goes to the heart of when I say we're going to scale -- use our scale as a company that we are today to mitigate what would be an insurmountable cost for a start-up to stop this business. We have 465 people in the business. We already have a fully staffed investment arm, both here in the U.S. as well as in the U.K. and in Amsterdam, taking care of our international business. So, we don't see any need or any incremental personnel on the investment side. That's scale benefit, number 1. Scale benefit number two. We are going to be agnostic as to whether these assets are held in a fund, which, by the way, the public entity will have a fairly large interest in or whether it is on balance sheet. And thus, our asset management team that has done a superb job on the public side, both here in the U.S. as well as in the international markets in London, they will continue to manage these assets. That's benefit number two. Any dispositions, any elements of that, we already have the team here. We have a very large legal team that we are going to leverage that obviously is a massive source of pride for us given that we do a majority of the work in-house. We will continue to lean on them to help with transaction negotiations, lease negotiations, et cetera. That scale benefits, number three. We already have the setup in place -- and so we are not going to be needing new people to help do the block and tackle work that is required of an investment arm where we will have incremental cost will be around a fund manager and the reporting as well as an IR function that will be dealing with a very specific type of investor base on the private side. But outside of that, from accounting finance, which, by the way, is again something we are very proud of, will all be leveraged with the existing platform that we have. That's my comment around the incremental cost in standing this business up will be fairly muted.
Spenser Allaway: Very helpful. And then just last one, can you talk about how the competitive landscape is changing? Or if there's been any changes in the U.S. and Europe right now as it relates to the transaction market?
Sumit Roy: Yes, Spenser, it's the -- it's very fluid in terms of who we are starting to compete against. There is no doubt that private arms are becoming much bigger players in transactions that we are pursuing. And of course, we've had a few more companies in the net lease space that have become public. We don't run into most of them given the types of transactions that we pursue, but it is a crowded field in terms of competition here in the U.S. In the international market, it continues to be one of the biggest advantages that we have, where we are running into more competition today than we did, let's call it, a year or two years ago, but we -- but it's still not quite as intense as what we experienced here in the U.S. And most of that competition comes from private capital in the international market. So, that's the flavor of who we compete against in the U.S. and in the international markets.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Upal Rana with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Upal Rana: Sumit, you talked about the momentum in the transaction market, an but I wanted to kind of get a sense on have buyers and sellers really reacted to that 50 basis points rate cut and with another 25 basis points cut likely this week and then with the 10-year really driving higher about 65 basis points since the last Fed rate cuts. So, I want to get good sense on that.
Sumit Roy: Yes. I think, Upal, so much of the volatility across the curve at this point is around what will happen today. And it's the largest exogenous factor that's going to determine where the curve settles down. We are not as exposed to the short end of the curve. We are -- but it's not to the same extent as we are to the long end of the curve. And so, what's happening on the long end of the curve definitely has an impact on our cost of capital because that becomes a permanent source of financing and our ability to pursue transactions. And that is a function of inflation expectations that people have about the future. And if policies are going to get put into place, where the inflation expectation is going to suddenly be much higher than what it had been traditionally, that is going to have an impact on where the tenure is going to settle and that will certainly have an impact either on the positive side or on the negative side for the permanent cost of capital for a net lease business. And those are largely policy driven. We've had parties coming up with proposals that have a diverse set of impacts on this particular inflation expectations. So too early to tell where all of this is going to settle. It is creating a fair amount of volatility, and we are hopeful that regardless of who wins, once we have more clarity in terms of what the curve is going to look like, we'll be able to execute on business as usual.
Upal Rana: Great. That was helpful. And then last one for me. Going back to the private capital fund. I know you've already listed a bunch of benefits there. But I wanted to get your sense on why now and why this makes sense in today's economic environment. And I know you mentioned capacity could be an issue in the future, but is there anything else that you may have been dealing with that was creating some friction on your end?
Sumit Roy: Really, Upal, there is nothing that we are seeing either on the credit side. I think I went through a pretty detailed list to share with you that on the credit side, we feel very good. Our credit watch list actually came down by 10 basis points to 4.2%. And from the previous quarter. So, we feel very good on the credit side. We feel very good on the health of the market to precipitate transactions setting aside what's happened over the last couple of weeks, but that too shall pass is our expectation. Really, the timing is around to do this right, which obviously is our collective desire. We want to do this very slowly and we want to do it very thoughtfully and it's going to take a long time, a long time for this to become a mature business. I mean look at one of our peers who has probably one of the most successful open-ended fund businesses, and that's Prologis. And they've been in that business for 20-plus years. And today, it has become -- we can step back and say it is a super successful business that some very smart people went into 20 years ago. And so, in anticipation of what could happen 10 years from now, et cetera, when we start to run up against this, our desire to put out capital and perhaps the limits of just accessing the capital sources that we have today, that could become more acute. And so, we have to start today to build this history and to build this fun business to a point where it really starts to bear fruit for our public shareholders et cetera. And that's it. That's why we are doing it today. There is no -- there is -- it doesn't matter at which point in the cycle we would have done this, that question would and should be asked, but it's really about starting now when we don't have a need for additional capital and building this business to get ahead of what could be a limiting factor multiple years down the road.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Just a few quick ones. Can you give us an update on where 2024 bad debt year-to-date has trended? And what's your outlook for '25?
Jonathan Pong: Yes. So, Linda, if you look at the earnings release, first nine months of this year, we've incurred about $6 million in bad debt expense. That's around 40 basis points of our rental revenue. When you take out this one C-store operator that we referenced earlier. You're really looking at sub-20 basis points on 18 basis points. We've talked historically about how when you exclude the pandemic, we've been right there around 25 basis points of credit loss in a given year as a percentage of revenue. So, to be at 18 outside of these onetime unusual events, we think is pretty indicative of a very constructive and healthy portfolio.
Sumit Roy: And I think we -- as Sumit alluded to earlier, the credit loss was at 4.2%. There's really not a lot out there that we're really monitoring that meaningful. There's no 1-plus percent exposure tenants on there. We feel as though those that are on the watch list, we've been monitoring for quite some time. And in some cases, we have very good visibility into the cash flow coverage on these assets. And so, we'll get into all of the assumptions that we're baking in for 2025 come February when we release our guidance.
Linda Tsai: And then in terms of the C-store write-down in the quarter, what's the potential AFFO impact on earnings? And then what do you think is the recapture rate?
Jonathan Pong: So, in terms of this one C-store operator, it's really, I call it $1 million a month or so. And all of that is built in. All of that is built into our guidance. And we'll see where we trend out to in terms of recovery. But as we referenced earlier, we do feel like there could be quite a bit of interest in these assets. So, I think the default response that we have to offer up is you look at our historical precedents and being able to get 84%, 85% or recapture of any rent that's been impacted by from bank or credit event.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Kamdem: Just two quick ones back to the fund. I think you talked about some of the investments that the fund would be interesting in the fund where the public equity couldn't do it. I guess my other question is just, is there any other differences in terms of dividend policy in terms of geography, like in the fund go anywhere? And in your mind, is that investor that's going into the fund, is that a completely different investor base that would contemplate the stock? Or is there some overlap?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Ron, we haven't really done any work on the investor profile, but the comments I made about how much bigger this investable universe is of potential investors to look to invest in real estate through a fund structure is what's so compelling. Is it possible that you have some of these funds that have ambit to invest in public securities and they have a mandate to invest in private direct investments? I'm sure that may be the case. But even those investors will tell you that what they have to invest through a fund structure directly into real estate is multiples of what they have on the security side. So, I can't give you a more precise answer than that, but the vast majority, I believe, are going to be investors who don't have the ability to invest in public securities but would like to utilize our platform, work with us and invest in the product that we invest in. And outside of that, the strategy is one that I've already touched on. There's not going to be anything new that the fund business is going to be doing that we won't do on balance sheet. Keep in mind that the goal is we will be a massive co-investor in this fund. And so, our interests are going to be perfectly aligned in terms of what it is that we pursue.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And then my second quick one is just an update on sort of the data center sort of initiatives. Obviously, there's been a lot of data points about demand ramping? Just how are you guys sort of seeing the pipeline in that vertical evolving?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So, I won't talk about pipelines, Ronald, but what you've referenced in terms of the demand, we're seeing that in space. And we've been very lucky to be speaking with multiple operators in this space. We see it in terms of what they're showing us regarding the pipeline that they've created we are trying to craft a value proposition that is compelling to these operators. And we are very optimistic about where this particular business could go for realty income going forward. We feel like we can be a solution that helps meet some of the demand and the capital needs to execute on what is a once in a cycle type situation. And at the end of the day, we have capital allocators. And if we can allocate capital exposed to S&P 10, S&P 20 clients for 20 years, that's our core business. And so, we are excited, but it's too early to tell in terms of how this is all going to play out.
Operator: And our next question today comes from R.J. Milligan at Raymond James. Please go ahead.
R.J. Milligan: So, I wanted to ask a couple more questions on the funds, given those examples of some of the transactions that might be more appropriate there, has been helpful. And I wanted to be clear, do you expect the fund to invest in properties that might not necessarily have triple net leases and therefore, have better internal growth or more structured investments, development loans. So, I'm just trying to get an idea of what the mix is or if it's going to be pure triple net.
Sumit Roy: R.J., what I'll share with you is you should think of these investments in terms of flow-through, rental income flowing through to NOI to be very similar to what we've done on balance sheet right? The idea is not to go and start executing on businesses that have a 40% NOI margin. That's not what we do. And so, when we talk about data centers, we are not going to be going out there and buying colocation sites where the flow-through is very different versus hyperscale single-tenant 20-year leases that may not be precisely triple net, but the flow-through is still incredibly high, i.e., mimicking what a triple net asset should be generated. That's really the -- what we are going to be doing.
R.J. Milligan: Okay. And then two quick follow-ups, and I may have missed the answers. But number one, do you expect the cost of equity to be higher or lower than Realty's.
Sumit Roy: So, the cost of equity as defined by long-term return hurdles should be very similar, but their focus is on the long-term hurdle rate, not on day one accretion. And that's the big difference, R.J. That's why I gave the examples that I did that the return profile long term is very similar for both of these businesses. But we, as a public entity, 100% public entity, today cannot meet our dual mandate of generating that year one spread and the long-term hurdle rate. Both those have to be met in order for us to pursue transactions in the public markets today. That's how we are valued, and we are very grateful for that. We understand that that's how -- that's the game we have to play. But there are assets that we are passing up on very high-quality assets that can meet the long-term hurdle, but will potentially have a much lower starting point. And that, I think, is what we'll be able to do through this fund structure and enhance our co-investment through the recurring asset management fee stream, which is essentially the monetization of the platform that we have. to the benefit of our public shareholders. That's how this will work.
R.J. Milligan: Okay. And one last follow-up is, will Realty Income be contributing properties to the fund?
Sumit Roy: There will be a seat portfolio that will allow us to have conversations with potential investors. But thereafter, it will be new investments that we pursue. That's how we're thinking about it today. So outside of that initial seed portfolio, everything else will be new transactions that we'll be pursuing.
Operator: And our next question comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Greg McGinniss: Sumit, I just want to follow up on that last question. So, you mentioned Prologis, right? And I think that's where the contribution question comes from. But -- could you instead maybe envision increasing investment into developments, which may be otherwise you wouldn't have underwritten that would then be contributed to the platform? Or would you instead pursue those developments within the platform itself?
Sumit Roy: Greg, that's a very good question because when we pursue development, we do have certain accounting elements that we have to adhere to. And there are times where we are unable to recognize the full cash impact, the positive cash yield that we are able to generate on dollars that we are investing in a development scenario, just given the lease accounting that we have, that's certainly not going to be a prohibitive factor doing it through the fund structure. And so, could we do more of those? Yes. In the fund, the answer is yes. But again, it needs to meet and exceed the overall return hurdles that we would we would need to address. So, there are a lot of things that this alternative source of financing could allow us to do, which we have done as a public entity, but only in a limited way because of some of the inherent limitations that we have either in terms of how we can report stuff, et cetera. So, I do think that this will give us the flexibility and thus, the comment I made about expanding the sandbox of the types of transactions that we would be able to pursue by having this alternative source of capital available to us.
Greg McGinniss: And do you already have kind of first investors in mind or conversations that you've had on this front?
Sumit Roy: We have none of that in mind. We have and I think I've talked about this, what is -- the profile of this investor would look like. We certainly have that, and we are working with our advisers who have shared with us what the details are around that, but we haven't had any conversations today.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. And just final follow-up for Jonathan. Is there anything specific to point to in the slight increase in the midpoint to the expense leakage guidance?
Jonathan Pong: Yes. It's a combination of a few things. Greg, first of all, there's been some deferred expenses we brought forward, some that were carried forward from last year. We're just trying to get ahead of spend and trying to catch up in some cases. So, there is a little bit of heavier load this quarter. I would also say for this year, I would also say that there are some carry costs that we are incurring with a few vacant assets that do comprise a bit of an increase on a year-over-year basis from a margin perspective. And then also, I think when you're just comparing to the 1.1% leakage that we experienced last year, keep in mind we did bring in a $9 billion portfolio in January with the Spirit portfolio. And that did have slightly more leakage as well just on a run rate basis. So, I would really attribute it to those factors as what's driving the slight increase going from 1.1% and now to a midpoint of 1.35%.
Operator: And our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: I just want to have a question on the development pipeline. When do you expect the nonretail to lease up? Are you holding back leasing on that right now?
Sumit Roy: Yes, that's a great question, Wes. Look, it's a very small portion of the overall development. I think it's like 15% plus/minus in that ZIP code. And even though the quantum that we have identified for this particular type of development, we really don't spend until we get clarity on the leases coming through. And so, we feel very confident. We are partnering with one of the best developers in Panattoni, and we feel very confident that some of these are going to get leased up in the near term. And keep in mind, we won't make the big capital investment without having line of sight on potential clients being able to step in and take over those leases.
Wes Golladay: Maybe just a quick follow-up on that, since it's more spec in nature. Are you going to get a little bit more incremental yield?
Sumit Roy: Yes, absolutely. And in fact, in situations where -- we've had two buildings, one was leased and the other one wasn't. We have expectations and what we think the lease rates are going to be and -- so far, more often than not, those lease rates -- our expected lease rates have been superseded by what actually ends up happening. So, this continues to build a fair amount of confidence in not only our partners, but also our team's ability to underwrite these types of transactions.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking soon and seeing you at a conference in the coming weeks. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-06 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Bakke, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.
Steve Bakke: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's first quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. You'll disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Steve. Welcome, everyone. In the second quarter, I am pleased we were able to deliver strong results of the economy as well as the transaction market, navigate today’s rate environment. We see to be real estate partners to the world’s leading companies and the diligent efforts of our dedicated team resulted in AFFO per share of $1.06 representing a robust 6% growth compared to last year. Combined with our annualized dividend yield in excess of 5% our shareholders owned a total operational return of over 11%. The power of our global sourcing and acquisition platform was on display this quarter as we deployed capital in the U.S. and Europe across retail, industrial and data center real estate, and the real estate-backed credit opportunities. In total, we invested $805.8 million into high-quality opportunities at a blended 7.9% initial cash yield, or an 8.2% straight-line yield, assuming CPI growth of 2%. Of this, approximately $262 million of volume was invested in the U.S. at a 7.6% initial cash yield. The balance of approximately $544 million was invested in Europe at an 8% initial cash yield, including a $377.5 million investment in a secured note at an 8.1% yield issued by Asda, a leading U.K. grocery operator. As we discussed in the past, we intend to pursue credit investments selectively, and only when it may eventually facilitate access to high-quality real estate opportunities, as has been the case with Asda. We also believe these credit investments represent a profitable means for Realty Income to participate in and benefit from the current rate environment. Furthermore, from a risk management perspective, we view these credit investments as a prudent, natural hedge to the inherent rate exposure as we have on the liability side of our balance sheet. Providing further detail on investments in the quarter, we executed 79 discrete transactions with 55 clients, including two new clients across 22 industries. 31% of direct real estate investment volume was allocated to new sale leasebacks. Touching on our sourcing activity, we were pleased that our transaction discipline earlier this year is bearing fruit. As this quarter, we began to see a greater number of opportunities available at pricing that aligns with our cost of capital. This improvement supported the $200 million increase in transaction volume sequentially, and it drove the investment guidance increase to $3 billion in June, a 50% increase from our prior guidance. We believe the higher closed volume paired with investment spreads that are largely consistent with last quarter are signs the transaction market may be moving towards normalization. Investment activity this quarter was funded in large part by adjusted free cash flow, which totaled approximately $200 million in the second quarter. Not having to rely on public equity enhanced the accretive nature of these transactions. The deployment of excess cash flow represents an important contributor to our growth. In fact, we believe we can utilize excess free cash flow together with our portfolio's internal rent growth to deliver an approximate 7% to 8% total operational return annually to shareholders without relying on public equity issuance. The portfolio's stabilized internal growth rate has risen in recent years, and now stands at approximately 1.5% on an annualized basis, in part because of the expansion of our European platform, where many leases are subject to uncapped CPI increases, as well as our expansion into the gaming and data center verticals, which where leases often include healthy annual rent escalators. With the benefit of excess free cash flow, second quarter capital deployment activity resulted in investment spread of approximately 293 basis points, which like the first quarter is well above our historical spread of 150 basis points, in part due to the utilization of excess free cash flow. As a reminder, these disclosed investment spreads utilize our short-term nominal cost of capital, which measures the estimated year one earnings dilution from raising capital on a leverage neutral basis to fund our investment volume. This is different from a higher long-term cost of capital, which applies a growth premium to our cost of equity to account for the long-term return requirements for our investors. While we remain vigilant in today's volatile environment, seeking only the most attractive risk adjusted return opportunities, we will also only utilize external capital opportunistically aiming to augment our growth rate at times when our cost of capital becomes increasingly attractive as compared to prevailing market investment yields. An additional source of capital in the second quarter was dispositions. We utilize proprietary predictive analytic tools in combination with the insights of our asset management and research teams to drive the decision to sell 75 properties for total net proceeds of approximately $106 million, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $202 million. For the year, we expect to sell between $400 and $500 million of assets. As we continue to calibrate and hone our predictive analytic tools, advancing our investment pieces on each property in our portfolio, we may be more active on dispositions than in the past. We continue to optimize our portfolio composition and investment returns while broadening our use of organically generated capital to finance growth. Another critical point of differentiation for Realty Income is the strength of our balance sheet, underpinned by our low leverage of 838 minus credit ratings by Moody's and S&P respectively, and our access to capital on a global basis. During the second quarter of 2024, the combination of internally generated cash flow and disposition sale proceeds allowed us to fund most of our investment activity without settling any newly issued equity capital while still maintaining our leverage metrics at or below our long-term targets. Shifting to operations, our portfolio continues to generate very solid returns and to perform in a very stable fashion. Occupancy rose to 98.8% as of June 30th, a 20 basis point increase from the prior quarter. Additionally, our rent recapture rate across 199 leases was 105.7%, totaling approximately $34 million in new annualized cash rent. The size, scale, diversification, and consistency of performance from our global real estate portfolio continues to provide us with excellent visibility to revenue and is a key reason why we have not had a single year of negative operational return in our 30 years as a public company. Managing through periodic store closures is a natural part of our business model, and our top-tier credit research and asset management teams offer distinct competitive advantages, which have consistently enabled us to optimize value in these situations. To that end, we would like to provide remarks on a few clients that are currently managing through store closures or have been in the news due to credit-related concerns. Importantly, in the context of our portfolio's size and scale, the aggregate financial exposure of potential loss rent is not expected to materially impact our ability to generate the consistent operational returns our shareholders are accustomed to. And it is important to emphasize our recent increase in earnings guidance takes all credit considerations into account. Rite Aid, which represents 30 basis points of our total portfolio analyzed contractual rent as of June 30, 2024, is expected to emerge from bankruptcy in the third quarter. Through the remainder of the bankruptcy process, we expect to lose 12 basis points of rent prior to the resolution of assets vacated in the proceedings, which are ultimately released or sold. Red Lobster represents 1% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rents and it is currently moving through the bankruptcy process. At present, as publicly stated, Red Lobster is targeting to emerge from bankruptcy in the third quarter of 2024. We continue to believe that our visibility into rent coverage and our master lease structure across most of our properties mitigate some of our potential risk. And while not finalized, we currently believe our recapture rate will be roughly in line with our historical portfolio-wide average of 84% for client bankruptcy restructurings. Walgreens is considered closing certain stores. Looking out over the next two and a half years, we have leases representing only 26 basis points of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent that will expire over that time. Outside of a bankruptcy strategy, which we view as unlikely with Walgreens, these are the only stores Walgreens can legally seize contractual rent payments on once each lease expires. To provide context on historical capture rates in the drugstore industry, we have managed 166 lease expirations since 2013. 80% of these were renewed. That resulted in a blended recapture rate in excess of 100% of prior rent. Dollar Tree, which is investment-grade rated, announced the potential split of their Family Dollar brand from Dollar Tree. If this were to result in store closings, Family Dollar leases representing only five basis points of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent are set to expire between now and year-end 2026. And of course, in the interim, they are obligated to continue paying rent through lease expiration. Our historical recapture results in the dollar store industries have been similarly favorable. We have managed 263 lease expirations since 2013, of which 86% of the clients renewed at a weighted average rate well north of 105%. In case of our tier 1.5% of exposure, we feel the risks have notably diminished in the past 12 months. Cineworld reduced its debt by $4.5 billion through its restructuring, and AMC recently made improvements to its financial position by extending debt maturities and additional equity issues. It is important to note that in total, the rent at risk from Rite Aid, Red Lobster, Walgreens, Dollar Tree, as well as At Home and Big Lots, which is 11 basis points of rent, represents in total only 2.3% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent through year-end 2026. And if we achieve the recapture rate in line with our long-term average for bankruptcies, which is 84%, this suggests only approximately 37 basis points of rent is at risk of ceasing, or an approximately $0.02 of AFO per share impact. In addition, if they do take place, advance notice of potential store closures are of incremental value to us because they provide years, in many instances, to plan the optimal outcome at those locations where the client's plan is to leave while we continue to be paid rent. This $0.02 per share potential impact is manageable and is counterbalanced by the power and stability of our net lease business model, which is underpinned by diversification across more than 15,000 properties, 1,500 clients, and 8 countries on 2 continents. Hence, we believe it is important to separate the store closing headlines from the manageable impact they have on our financials. With that, I would like to turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail. Jonathan?
Jonathan Pong: Thank you, Sumit. Consistency has long been a benchmark by which we manage our business. To that end, we ended the second quarter with leverage at 5.3 times without settling any ATM equity during the quarter. This was the 25th consecutive quarter of leverage at 5.5 times or lower, reflecting our commitment to our A3, A- credit ratings, which we have had now since 2018. As a reminder, we manage our leverage through the lens of net debt and preferred equity to annualize pro forma adjusted EBITDA. During the second quarter, we generated approximately $200 million of adjusted free cash flow, over $100 million in real estate sales proceeds, and approximately $185 million of forward unsettled equity sold through the ATM. After modest ATM issuance activity subsequent to quarter end, we currently have almost $450 million of unsettled forward equity, which we estimate will be more than sufficient to finance our equity needs for the remainder of 2024 and still remain within our target leverage ratios. Our balance sheet remains healthy with a well-staggered debt maturity schedule that allows us to be active should borrowing costs trend lower over the maturity cycle. Last month, we repaid $350 million of maturing public notes, leaving us with only $118 million of maturing mortgage debt for the balance of the year. Our exposure to variable [ph] rate debt of $1.6 billion remains modest at only 6.3% of total debt principal at quarter end, and our liquidity remains solid with access to approximately $3.8 billion of capital. At the end of the second quarter, inclusive of cash on hand, availability under our $4.25 billion revolving credit facility and our outstanding ATM forward equity. We remain comfortable with the liability side of the balance sheet and believe we are well positioned to act on larger investment opportunities should they present themselves. As Sumit mentioned earlier, we view our credit investments as a natural hedge to the inherent interest rate risk associated with debt maturities we have on our balance sheet. That end, the six year £300 million sterling senior secure loan we invested in during the quarter provides us with an attractive 8.1% yield secured by the solid credit of a U.K. grocery store operator, while reducing the rate sensitivity on the value of sterling debt we have on the balance sheet maturing in 2030, which currently totals £540 million. From a 2024 earnings guidance perspective, we are reiterating our full year investments at $3 billion in our AFFO per share guidance of $4.15 to $4.21, which represents 4.5% annual per share growth, assuming the midpoint. As a reminder, we increased our guidance on June 4, which included the expectation of collecting the $16 million of lease termination fees that we recognized in the second quarter. Offsetting a portion of AFFO tailwinds with termination fees was the recognition of approximately $6.2 million of AR reserves from one of our clients in the convenience store industry. Lease termination fees are excluded and are same-store rental revenue calculations, while AR reserves are included. Thus, the $6.2 million of reserves that we recognized on one client in the quarter alongside impacts by theatre portfolio held back our second quarter same-store rent growth by approximately 60 basis points, resulting in overall same-store growth of 0.2% for the quarter. Including this reserve, we continue to expect our full-year same-store rental revenue growth recovered to close to the 1% level for 2024. With that, I would like to hand the call back to Sumit for closing remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Jonathan. To conclude our prepared remarks, the year is progressing largely in line with expectations, perhaps even slightly ahead. There are signs the transaction market is beginning to normalize as we find more opportunities to deploy capital into high-quality investments, meeting our minimum return requirements. Adjusted free cash flow and dispositions continue to be accretive sources of capital we can use to support future growth. Combined with the stability of our solidly performing client base and the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to shareholders in a variety of economic environments. I'd like to now open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. The largest component of your investment volume this quarter was the investment in the Asda notes. How should we think about the different investment buckets that you have when it comes to expectations for the back half of the year? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Michael. That's correct. We did have a $377 million investment in the Asda loan, which was very opportunistic. We've already highlighted the reasons as to why we did that. What you should expect for the balance of the year, for the remaining half of the year, is that we are probably going to have the majority of our investments, if not 100% of our investments in our more traditional investment asset level, portfolio level, real estate direct investment. That's what's going to make up the balance of the remaining six months.
Michael Goldsmith: Got it. Then as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about the opportunities you're seeing in the U.S. versus European markets? Outside the loan, you leaned a little bit more to the U.S. in the second quarter or a reversal from the first quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in these markets and the spreads in the U.S. versus Europe? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Yes. During the first quarter, we had said that we're starting to see some green shoots here in the U.S. where sellers were starting to realize the higher cap rate environment was here to stay. That obviously resulted in an increase in volume in terms of investments here in the U.S. in the second quarter. We expect that to continue into the remainder of the year. The volume increase that we saw with regards to sourcing would also attest to that phenomena. I think with the backdrop that we are seeing on the cost of capital side, I do think that there will be more transactions that will materialize in the next half, especially here in the U.S. The markets in Europe have been fairly stable. I think the expectations of the interest rate cuts were well understood. What we saw in the first quarter where we had some opportunistic sellers come to the market and be with the beneficiaries of those transactions. Similar transactions took place in the second quarter. And we feel pretty confident that, that trend will continue for the remainder of the year. But you should see an increase in volume coming from the U.S. and more of the same in markets outside the U.S.
Operator: The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yes hey guys. Maybe just going back to the Asda loan. I think you've done some other loans in the past that were pretty sizable. Just kind of how do you think about like the duration risk and just like when you're typically taking the equity stake and doing a real estate loan, it's like you'd assume that real estate forever, but for a loan, it's kind of limited duration. Like how does that factor into your underwriting? Just like is there a limit maybe on exposure you want to have for lending?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So Joshua, we've been very clear with the market that the credit investment side of the business is an addendum to what we are offering our clients. We believe that opportunistically, it makes a lot of sense for us to continue to be a partner to our clients, such as Asda. And when you look at the investment we made, $377 million at an 8.1% 6-year paper [ph] and you overlay the fact that we have maturing debt close to £600 million coming due in about the same time frame, this is one of the reasons why we did what we did. Let me put this in perspective in a slightly different way. If we were to go out and try to do a sale leaseback on Asda real estate today, it would probably be in the mid-6s, maybe even in the slightly inside of that. And so for the same credit, if you're able to get 160, 170 basis points of additional spread over a 6-year period. I think it's -- and get the same exposure in terms of the credit. It's something that for us made a lot of sense. The other reason is one that we've continued to share with the market around why we have gone down this path of credit investments. We've always felt like, okay, we want to be long-term partners to some of our clients. We are willing to do 20-year paper sale leasebacks on their real estate. We are along the credit. We like the credit and if we can continue to create an even closer relationship by participating, higher up on the capital stack, that is something that makes a lot of sense for us. Especially when you take it in the context stuff, we are experiencing the negative impact of higher interest rate environment on our own balance sheet. And if we can offset using this credit investment as a tool, this negative impact that we experienced by participating on the asset side by providing credit to some of our clients then this is a very nice way to hedge this negative impact. Having said all of this, we've also been very clear that credit investment is going to be a point in time. This is not a tool that will work in every environment, and we don't expect to do credit investments in a very low interest rate environment. And so for all of the reasons that I've just enumerated, it's a wonderful tool to have. And thankfully, we have the relationships with clients who want us to participate, we would like to participate and it acts as a natural hedge to some of the negative headwinds that we encounter in this environment. So that's why we did what we did.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. And then maybe just one other question. Just you mentioned the expansion into data centers and gaming. It helps drive internal growth by going into those verticals. I guess are there any other verticals you're looking at or where you think you can get that higher internal growth rate if you're already in that vertical?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So the areas that give us that higher internal growth largely are the two you've mentioned and the international market. And obviously, this is not a new vertical for us, but industrial does tend to have higher internal growth as well. And the combination of our investments in these areas have resulted in the profile of internal growth changing from circa 1% in our business to 1.5%. And that will continue to be the areas that we focus in, in the future. I think this was a question that was asked in the previous call as well. Are there any new verticals that we are looking at? And the answer is no. We have a very well-defined total addressable market based on the verticals that we've already articulated to the market, and we are very comfortable continuing to play in those specified verticals. And there's plenty to be done. So we're very happy with that.
Operator: The next question comes from John Kilichowski from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
John Kilichowski: Hi, thank you. So the amount of IG tenants as a percentage of acquisitions was 10%, which I believe is lower since the third quarter of 2017. Maybe how should we think about that and your appetite to move down the risk curve to generate yields here?
Sumit Roy: Yes. I don't necessarily agree with the last comment that you made in your question that John. But I'll go ahead and answer this question around investment grade representing 10% of our investments in the second quarter. We've always been very clear with the market when we've said that we don't target investment grade as a criteria for investment. What we are looking for is are we generating the right yield for the credit risk that we are taking for the real estate risk that we are taking, etcetera. And the actual ratings of the client is a byproduct of being able to underwrite appropriate risk-adjusted return profile. And if it so happens that we have clients that are investment grade as a result of that risk-adjusted profile that we are targeting. That's great. But it's not something we specifically look for. Case in point, John, if you look at our portfolio today, there are so many names in our top 20. That just happened to be non-rated. And have they gone through a rating process, they would be investment-grade. Companies like Sainsbury's, Treasury Wine Estate, we have grocers like Public and Trader Joe's that are not rated today and don't constitute an investment-grade bucket for us, but if they were to be rated, they would be. And so the point I'm trying to make is it's not something that we target. It's a byproduct of our underwriting, and we are very comfortable continuing down that path.
John Kilichowski: Understood. And then I guess maybe jumping to bad debt here. On the last call, you mentioned the conservative nature of your bad debt number. I don't believe you provided it, but maybe could you talk about where it is today and if there's upside to your guide here?
Jonathan Pong: Yes. So if you just look at what we disclosed in the footnotes of the income statement on the earnings press release or the supplement, you'll see that we've recognized around $9 million on a year-to-date basis in bad debt expense. And so looking at that as a percentage of revenue, it is around 70 basis points or so. Now what we've always said is that historically, we've been roughly in the 35 basis point range as a percentage of revenue is the bad debt expense. And when you strip out the pandemic, it's closer to 23 basis points. So we're a little bit ahead of that, but a lot of that was related to this $6 million reserve that we did and uptaking on 1 C-store operator, we do not expect the magnitude of that to carry forward into the back half of the year. But there is still a little bit of conservatism there. And I think from our standpoint, even though we feel very good about a lot of these credits. I think in the back half of the year, you can assume that we're assuming something close to what we recognized in the first half.
Operator: The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, I guess first question, just a follow-up on the Asda loan. I guess, are there any purchase options or agreements attached to the loans? And I guess I'm assuming these are assets you wouldn't mind owning at some point. And then as part of that, I guess I just want to confirm, based on your comments in the call that we should not anticipate you doing more loan deals in the second half of the year, that there's nothing else from that type of activity embedded in the guide? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: So Haendel, yes, the last comment you made is accurate. We are not anticipating doing any credit investments in the second half but just to be very clear, credit investments is something that we have used opportunistically in the past, and we will continue to use opportunistically going forward. But it is not contemplated that we will do any in the second half. Having said that, you're right, this is a secured bond offering. And so it is the security that we have is obviously a lot of the unencumbered real estate that as continues to own. You're also correct in assuming that we are very comfortable going along the credit. You might recall in the third quarter of last year. We did a fairly large -- I want to say, norther $600 million of sale leaseback with Asda. So this is a credit that we are very comfortable with. We like the operators. We like what they're trying to do with their business. And this is a way for us to continue to strengthen that relationship going forward. But yes, part of what we are trying to do is in the event they decide to go down the path of doing sales leasebacks, we're going to be first in line. There are no guarantees, but we will be first in line for those conversations. And that's exactly the type of position we would like to be in going forward with clients such as this.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Helpful. And one more, if I may. I was intrigued by your comments on the investing landscape today. It sounds like you're seeing more opportunities to fit your buyback given your improved cost of capital and that seems like you're willing to be more active if the right opportunities present themselves. But I guess I'm curious if the lower cost of debt and just improving cost of capital more broadly is perhaps allowing some private competition to rent to the space. So I'm curious if you're seeing any incrementally new competitors or private equity reentering the landscape here? Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure. Good question, Haendel. Look, I think it's a little too early, but the reality is that in the event that interest rates do start to come down, private equity that has largely been absent from the market should start to come back in. We are not currently seeing that in the transaction that we are pursuing. We are seeing some institutional capital, I wouldn't call them private equity coming into the market and becoming a bit more aggressive. But it's not prevalent yet. But yes, if the interest rate environment continues to be positive, i.e., rate cuts start to materialize, finding private equity as a competitor is certainly something that we should expect. You talked about us becoming more aggressive given our cost of capital having improved, especially over the last couple of weeks. That is true. And our cost of capital has improved. But the point I want to keep making, Haendel, is we want to remain very disciplined. We do believe that there will be more transactions that should take place just given the backdrop that we've talked about. But we don't have to do a whole lot to generate the earnings guidance that we've shared with the market. And if the market opportunistically produces transaction for us, that we feel like makes a lot of sense for our portfolio, we will absolutely be first in line to take advantage of that. And that's the position that we want to be in. And -- but I don't think the fact that our cost of capital has improved, that's going to be the impetus to go out there and start doing more transactions. I think the materialization of actual transactions that we would like to be successful pursuing that is going to drive what we do in the second half. And we feel based on everything that we are seeing, plus the pipeline that we have, very confident that the investment market will continue to improve.
Operator: The next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hi, thanks. Just on that, I was just wondering about the transaction activity that you kind of had in your pipeline. I mean do you see more kind of larger portfolio deals in the offering? Or is it more kind of smaller kind of one-off transaction opportunities, just insert changes since your last quarterly call?
Sumit Roy: Smedes, there are some large front actions that will be coming to market in the second half. These are existing clients that we have that we are in constant conversations with as to whether we are lucky enough to win those transactions or whether they actually end up coming to market is still a bit of a question mark. But we are starting to see those types of conversations taking place, and we feel pretty good that the market is going to improve. Our pipeline is largely along the lines of what we've achieved to date on the straight up organic acquisition side. And there aren't any $1 billion portfolio. So that's what you're thinking that we have in our pipeline yet. But the conversation leads me to believe that there will be larger portfolios coming down, but we'll see.
Smedes Rose: Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you, too, I'm sorry if you maybe address this, but the termination fees you received in the quarter, they were related to one particular client or with a bunch of fees that happen to cut it at once. So just kind of wondering what they were related to?
Jonathan Pong: Yes, Smedes those related to one particular tenant. And it's really reflective of an agreement that our team will be able to reach with them for a handful of assets, not the entire exposure, but just a handful.
Operator: The next question comes from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Greg McGinniss: Hey hope you're doing well. I was just hoping to get a little more color on how you're identifying assets for disposition, whether that's tenant credit, renewal risk, geography? Any color would be appreciated.
Sumit Roy: Sure, Greg. So a lot of it is very, it's opportunistic. It is an analysis, a very deep analysis that the asset management team takes on looking at assets for existing clients that may not have the right return profile that longer term because the markets have changed, or that particular location is not what it used to be. There could be several reasons as to why they get into the disposition list, one of which could be credit as well. And so we are using our predictive analytic tools to help monitor these 15,000 assets that we have at any given point in time and it's coming out with a rating that then suggests that, hey, this one may have a high location risk or low fungibility available to these locations. And then we overlay the credit on top of that. And then asset management goes through those and tries to create various different areas of what is the economic outcome going to look like under , for instance, a client that may not have any credit issues will pay rent. But at the end, this asset may not have other alternatives available to it outside of a vacant sale. And that return profile will be compared with selling it today to see what yields a better outcome. And that's the analysis that the asset management team is undertaking far more directly today than I think we've done in the past and that's the reason why we've come up with the $400 million to $500 million of assets that we feel like does not necessarily have a long-term future in our portfolio. And that's how we come up with the list.
Greg McGinniss: Okay, thank you. And then on acquisitions, how should we be thinking about your view on investment spread with the improved cost of capital versus what you're actually seeing in the market. The U.S. cap rates were up 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Is that kind of a fair target area? Or could we see that start to come back in?
Sumit Roy: Greg, as you know, I think I don't see the cap rates moving out from these levels. And in fact, they probably are going to start to come in going forward just given the backdrop that we are all experiencing with better cost of capital, more competitors are going to start to come in. It's going to put pressure on the cap rates. So, but in terms of spread, which is how we think of our business, we are very hopeful of maintaining the spreads that we've achieved thus far. And it could be a combination of our improving cost of capital despite perhaps a slightly lower cap rate environment. But we are going to be very selective in what it is that we pursue, which is why we have not gone out and increased our acquisition guidance. But let's wait and see what happens over the next couple of months. Things are fairly volatile with elections coming up later this year. And obviously, we see what's happening on the geopolitical side. So it is a bit of a volatile period. But having filtered all of that, I think you should expect to see us trying to maintain the spreads that we've achieved thus far.
Operator: The next question comes from Upal Rana from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Upal Rana: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Sumit you touched on dispositions already, but I wanted to get your reasoning on providing guidance at this point? And is this a product of better visibility or a shift in strategy you did mention that you do impact -- expect to be more active on that front than the past. So you have sold a number of vacant properties already this year, but you still have another 185 more to go. So I want to get any color on that, that would be helpful.
Sumit Roy: Yes. Good question, Upal. You should expect at the end of it all, half of it to be occupied assets and half of it to be vacant assets. So clearly, the trend for the first half has been more vacant asset sales. So that's going to shift going forward. It is a slight shift in our strategy, but not if it is driven by two very large M&A deals that we've effectuated over the last 2.5 years. And clearly, and we've been very upfront about this. There are assets that we've inherited that it's not a long-term strategic hold for us. And so we just want to be more proactive in being able to dispose of these assets. And given the quantum of capital that this particular process can generate for i.e., $400 million to $500 million, we wanted to be very clear with the market that look, this is going to be a source of capital for us that you may or may not be aware of. And so people can appropriately underwrite that source of capital. And when we make statements like we don't have to be out in the equity market, this helps explain that piece. But the strategic rationale is always are constant vigilance on what is it that our portfolio looks like? Where has our strategic shifts occurred given everything that we are seeing and being a lot more proactive on the disposition side than we had traditionally been.
Upal Rana: Okay. Great. That was helpful. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the transaction market moving towards normalization. What did you mean by that? Did you mean in terms of volume, cap rates investment spreads, seller sentiment, competition? Maybe if you can give more any detail on that, that would be helpful.
Sumit Roy: Sure. So obviously, a lot of sellers were on the sideline hoping for cap rates to move, we've always talked about the cost of capital is a mark-to-market variable that's essentially getting marked every second but cap rates tend to be stickier. And when the cost of capital changed as abruptly as it did for a lot of the REIT sector, the sellers were not able to accept that environment. And so they were waiting on the sidelines, expecting things to change, but sellers can't wait indefinitely. And we've seen that phenomenon play out in the international markets more so than here. And so when that happens, sellers start to creep back into the market after a period of time. And the added element that's taking place is there's a little bit more clarity today, and I say that and I smile as to where the interest rates are going to go, and so obviously, the cost of capital side of the equation has changed for a lot of the REITs. And so this is going to allow them to transact on transactions on assets that they would have looked at doing had their cost of capital being better. And so I think it's a movement on the buyer side. It's going to be a movement on the seller side. And that's what I mean that this should facilitate more transactions in the second half than it has in the first half.
Operator: The next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Yes, hi. The 1% of same-store revenue growth you're achieving this year. What does it look like for next year if your portfolio stabilized internal growth rate is 1.5% on an annualized basis?
Jonathan Pong: Yes. So Linda, first of all, there's some moving pieces with this year's guidance of approximately 1% on same-store. It's a difficult year-over-year comp because we did have some reserve reversals and deferment payments that we realized last year. Last year, we had 1.9% was our same-store number. This year at 2%, you're kind of averaging -- this year at 1%, excuse me, you're kind of averaging outside 1.5 or so level. And so next year, there should be an easing of the difficult comps, but what we've always been framing for investors, especially more recently is that we are around 1.5% on a contractual rent basis, growth basis. And we would expect that to continue next year and beyond.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. And then assuming an 84% recapture rate through year-end 2016, you only have 37 bps or $0.02 of AFFO per share impact at risk. Could that mean that your bad debt outlook in 2025 is stable or even less than what we saw this year?
Sumit Roy: Linda, the way to think about bad debt is we start the year expecting a certain percentage of bad debt expense. And in certain years, we either meet bills in a lot of years, we beat them. And in certain other years like the pandemic year, it goes beyond what we had originally gone into the year with. I think this is one of those -- like last year, for instance, we had positive outcomes on what our initial expectation was, which was, I think, 40, 50 basis points of rent. And all of last year, we not only did not have any bad debt expense, we actually ended up collecting on rents that we had on cash accounting. So that was a positive outcome. This year, this seems to be trending more in line with what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. And there is some potential upside, but we are not -- we've still got five months left, and we'll see how things play out. But traditionally, it's been right around that 23% absent the pandemic year. And inclusive of the pandemic year, it's been right around 37%, 37 basis points, sorry, 37 basis points of rent that has basically been bad debt expense. So do we expect 2025 to be similar, yes? But we generally don't talk about years well in advance, which is why I'm pointing to what historically has happened at Realty Income.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Fagan [ph] from Baird. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Kind of to go back to the C-store client, that litigation. Do you have that space back? And is there already a replacement tenant for that asset?
Sumit Roy: We don't, Alex, which is why we are in litigation and which is where the upside comes from. So we've essentially that this year is going to be a resolution year. Once we get those assets back, we are very confident in our ability to find alternative clients in the C-store space for those particular locations. So that's where the upside is. And no, we are not expecting to resolve any of that this year.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe for Jonathan. What are you thinking about future debt issuances, what currency is currently most attractive? And at what rate can you issue that?
Jonathan Pong: Yes, look, so if we were to sit here today and guess what indicative is might be on 10-year unsecured paper, you're probably looking at the very low 5s, call it, 5.1, 5.2 for U.S. dollar and sterling and then you're probably looking at very low 4s, about 100 basis points tighter in the Eurozone. So we always want to have a level of flexibility, I think when you look at how far wide sterling has traded relative to the dollar over the last few years and now that it's back to parity, we have been leaning more towards the dollar side over the last few years, and the optionality is there for us because we do have the currency net investment hedge capacity to be active in the sterling market. But obviously, the more euro deals that we do and transact on the greater the ability for us to access 4% paper will be. So these are the kind of things that we think about on a daily basis. A lot of it depends on the currency of the assets that we're bringing on the books. But we're glad that we left quite a bit of capacity in these currencies that are starting to trade at parity or even inside of it relative to a dollar.
Operator: The next question comes from Spenser Allaway from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Spenser Allaway: Maybe just one going back to the transaction market. Can you just comment on where you're seeing the largest bid-ask spreads either across property types or industries?
Sumit Roy: For the first half of the year spent it was here in the U.S. That's the reason why our volumes were much lower than what was -- that's what was traditionally seen in what we've done. I think that's starting to compress that bid-ask spread, which is the reason why we feel pretty confident that the markets here in the U.S. is going to start to materialize favorably for us. And yes, so that's what we see.
Operator: The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey just two quick ones for me. Just one, just on the interest cost. Can you remind us how much of the guidance this year, the FFO growth, how much of it was a drag just from higher interest expense and so forth? And how are you thinking about sort of the maturities in 2025?
Jonathan Pong: Yes. So definitely it wasn't much of a drag this year. I mean luckily, for us, we came out and did a debt offering in January and that was in the very low 5s, just above 5. So when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, not a big difference. We did obviously have a $350 million bond that we did repay. So there's a little bit of dilution from that. But I think when you look into 2025, we've got $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion, a 4.2% I just talked about how maybe there's 100 basis points of dilution if we were to do something like sterling and dollars based off of today's indicative rates that would have no more than about a 50 basis point impact to earnings. So it's obviously come in quite a bit. But obviously, if we have something from a euro standpoint that we can take advantage of that it will be breakeven for 2025 for short-term borrowings. Yes, it has been a little bit more dilutive because we peaked with the Fed funds rate this year. But I think much better than it was last year where that was close to 2% of growth that was held back solely because of that.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And then my second question was just on the new growth verticals specifically, just double clicking on sort of data centers and sort of gaming. Obviously, you've done two great deals with two great partners. But just wondering as you're thinking about sort of the future deals opportunity, is there sort of any bless and learns any way that you want to structure it differently maybe that you're thinking about as the opportunity gotten more attractive, less attractive? Just trying to get a sense of where we are 12, 24 months into this process? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Ronald. So on the gaming side, just based on performance of the assets that we have visibility into -- it's clearly been a great investment for us. Both the assets that we currently either own 100% or partially owned have continued to perform, and we -- then the leases that were structured were, in our view, very favorable leases. It was a fair lease both to the operator and to us. And I'm not sure if there's anything there that we would change based on what we've learned over the last two years. On the data center side, we've only got one investment that has now come online. And we are very excited about continuing to work with our partner, our existing partner and some new partners that we are trying to cultivate within this space. Like I've said, the hyperscale business with enterprise clients, it's a massive business and one that I don't think any single or even three, four sources of capital can solve. And we believe that this is a total addressable market that has a place for somebody like us partnering with the right developers, operators to create our own portfolio that grows from where we are today. And I don't need to go into the thesis as to the why, but it's fairly new for us to really reflect on lessons learned. We are still trying to build that particular pipeline up. And in time, I'm sure we will share lessons learned. But one of the things that we are very focused on, and this is not necessarily based on our own history, but the history of this particular sector is to make sure that the rents that we are underwriting to day one are rents that can be supported come to renewal time, even 10, 15 years out. And I think that was one of the lessons that this particular sector had to learn the hard way when they went through renewals and they were taking write-downs in space. But outside of that, make sure that things that can become obsolete are investments that we would want the operator to make. And we stay as close and as true to the real estate as we possibly can. That's really the lens through which we are looking at the data center space.
Operator: We have a follow-up question from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi, thanks for taking my follow up. Just on the 84% recapture rate. How much does that number move around any given year? And could that actually go down next year if you have a longer run rate for knowing when those closures are going to happen?
Sumit Roy: No. The 84% is our historical average through the bankruptcy process. So any client that goes through a Chapter 11 process and if you compare the emerging rent to the pre-bankruptcy rent, that recapture rate is 84%. And Linda, if you look at the amplitude within that 84%, if you actually look at individuals, we've had situations where we've collected 70% or 65% of the rent. And then there have been situations where we've collected 100% of the rent pre-bankruptcy versus post-bankruptcy. So there is variance around this 84%, but that has historically been what we've achieved. And that's the number that we are sharing with the market.
Linda Tsai: Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for closing remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking soon and seeing you at conferences in the coming months.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-07 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Bakke, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.
Steve Bakke: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's first quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. You'll disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Steve. Welcome, everyone. Our results for the start of 2024 illustrate our focus on thoughtful, disciplined growth and continue to demonstrate the consistency of our global operating and acquisition platform. We believe our value proposition to investors is a simple one. Our demonstrated ability to generate consistent positive operational returns regardless of market volatility and economic environment. Our projected 2024 operational return profile of approximately 10%, which comprises an anticipated dividend yield close to 6% and AFFO per share growth of approximately 4.3%, assuming the midpoint of guidance is a validation of our value proposition. To summarize the results from the quarter, we would highlight several key takeaways. First, diversification. Diversification by geography, asset types and client relationships. We believe our business model is unique in the real estate sector as we have optionality to grow in different regions with investments in a multitude of real estate products where we see superior risk-adjusted returns. During the first quarter, we invested $598 million at an initial weighted average cash yield of 7.8% across three property types: retail, industrial and data centers. Over half of this volume representing approximately $323 million was invested in Europe and the U.K. at an 8.2% initial weighted average cash yield. Investment volume in the U.S. was modest during the quarter. Of the $275 million of U.S. volume, which was invested at a 7.3% initial weighted average cash yield all but $16 million was invested in previously committed development takeouts. This quarter's bias towards international volume is a testament to the diversity of geographies we consider to allocate capital. To further elaborate, our investment volume during the quarter consisted of 87 discrete transactions with three transactions over $50 million, which speaks to the breadth of our platform. Our ultimate focus with any growth vertical or new region is to serve as a real estate partner to the world's leading companies and to ensure the investment outcome matches the consistent risk return profile of our investments, which have proven resilient over almost five decades as an operating company and three decades as a public company. Second, the health of our portfolio remains solid across all key operational metrics. We finished the quarter with occupancy of 98.6% consistent with the prior quarter and our projections. And we delivered another strong leasing quarter with rent recapture of 104.3% on the 198 leases that we renewed or re-leased during the quarter. At quarter end, our list of tenants on the credit watch list comprise approximately 5.2% of total portfolio annualized rent, which is in line with our historical average and with no individual client representing more than 1% of our total portfolio annualized rent. Consequently, we would highlight the diversification of our portfolio, which today consists of over 1,500 clients in all 50 states, the UK and six other countries in Western Europe, all of which helps insulate us from potential disruptive interest rate and credit events that could impact the durability of our cash flow. Finally, our balance sheet and access to capital continues to represent a major competitive advantage and affords us significant flexibility to fund our business without the need for external capital. After the Spirit merger closed in January, our annualized free cash flow available for investments is approximately $825 million. This provides us significant organic investment capacity to finance our growth plans without being required to tap into the debt or equity markets to meet current investment guidance. I would also note this also excludes any additional capacity generated by our disposition program, which I will discuss later. In spite of volatility in the capital markets, we posted a nominal first year investment spread of over 340 basis points in the first quarter, which is well above our historical spread of around 150 basis points. The primary driver of these outside spreads is the significant portion of investment volume funded to free cash flow, which by virtue of being a non-diluted source of capital, meaningfully reduces our nominal first year cost of capital. To be clear, our investment decisions remain based on our long-term weighted average cost of capital, which considers only our cost of stock for equity and long-term 10-year unsecured debt. This establishes the minimum return hurdle we seek to exceed across our aggregate investment activity. In all cases, our long-term WACC has exceeded our nominal first year cost of capital with respect to our transactions. This long-term oriented underwriting model is what drives our focus on acquiring high-quality real estate, leased to solid operators who are leaders in their respective industries, because we believe these opportunities have significantly lower residual risk -- value risk. In addition, to reach our longer-term growth hurdle rates, we are increasingly prioritizing meaningful contractual rent escalators in our leases with conservative rent coverage metrics that we believe will be even more resilient through a variety of economic cycles. In summary, activity in the transaction market remains uneven. Many potential sellers of real estate remain sidelined, given this uncertain interest rate environment, which is amplified by mixed inflation related data over the last six months. Sellers remain reluctant to transact and the breadth and depth of domestic investment opportunities have compressed as a result. However, as experienced in prior cycles, we remain optimistic that the market will provide more opportunities in the second half of the year as the economic outlook becomes clearer. Turning to portfolio operations. As previously mentioned, our recapture rate was 104.3%, contributing to same-store rent growth of 0.8% in the first quarter. Excluding the negative impact from our Sinovel theater portfolio, following the lease amendments finalized late last year, our same-store portfolio was up 1.4%, largely in line with the contractual rent growth embedded in our portfolio. One of our competitive advantages in the marketplace is our asset management and real estate operations functions, consisting of over 80 individuals who we believe are among the most talented in the industry. Since becoming a public company in 1994, we have now resolved over 6,000 lease expirations at a blended rent recapture rate of 102.5%, which is a testament to our acquisition underwriting, quality of our real estate and the scale of our asset management and real estate operations teams. During the quarter, we sold 46 properties for total net proceeds of $95.6 million. Our recycling efforts are a function of a more active investment management initiative. Our active decision-making on dispositions is supported by our proprietary predictive analytics platform. In recent years, we have harnessed the collective contributions of our predictive analytics team, the credit underwriting group, and the fundamental input from our asset management group to inform our acquisition strategy. We believe the combined benefits of these three groups provide us a significant differentiation in the industry as a result of the quantum of data we have gathered across our portfolio over our long operational history. So now in addition to our acquisition program, we are using the data to more proactively manage the portfolio and guide our active disposition program. I will now turn it over to Jonathan, who will add further color to the quarter.
Jonathan Pong: Thank you, Sumit. It's been a quiet start to the year on the capital markets front, following our January US dollar bond offering, which raised $1.25 billion in gross proceeds at a blended yield to maturity of approximately 5.14%. As introduced in our prior earnings call, our financing strategy for 2024 does not require incremental capital to finance our growth and acquisition needs. This continues to be the case at our current investment guidance. To that end, we had another quarter with a net debt and preferred equity, annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.5 times, that's in line with our target ratio. During the quarter, we settled approximately $550 million of equity previously raised through our ATM program, and which was outstanding on a forward basis. This leaves us with approximately $63 million of outstanding equity available for future settlements. And when combined with approximately $825 million of annualized free cash flow available to us following the Spirit merger, and the disposition program that Sumit referenced, our $2 billion investment guidance for the year is one, we believe can be funded without having to tap the markets. Our debt maturity schedule for the remainder of the year is modest, with approximately $469 million of remaining maturities, excluding $342 million of short-term commercial paper and revolver borrowings and of cash. As always, we look to maintain significant financial flexibility to fund known and identified liquidity and with approximately $4 billion of total liquidity available to us and minimal variability debt exposure on the balance sheet, we believe we can refinance these maturities while still retaining significant liquidity headroom and keeping ydebt exposure well below 10% of our debt capital stack through the balance of the year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sumit for closing remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Jonathan. In summary, the year is off to a solid start that is in line with expectations. Our earnings growth profile for the balance of the year remains consistent with our outlook and earnings guidance we gave in February. The tempered pace of activity in the first quarter reflects our long-standing capital allocation discipline, and we will remain selective as cap rates adjust to the current rate environment. In the meantime, the levers we can exercise from an internal funding standpoint, in particular, free cash flow and capital recycling, allow us to continue investing at spreads well over 200 basis points on a leverage-neutral basis. Our approximately 4% AFFO per share projected growth rate, paired with our estimated annualized dividend yield of approximately 6% is why we believe our platform offers one of the most compelling investment opportunities in the S&P 500. With that, I would like to open it up for questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP. Please go ahead.
Nate Crossett: Hey, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just talk about the current pipeline what does pricing look like so far into 2Q? Where is the pipeline weighted? And I know it's this most sample size, but pretty attractive yields in Europe in the quarter. Is there anything to note there?
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Nate. Good question. I think what you're seeing here in the U.S. is largely a confusion around where the rates are going. When will the rate cuts materialize and it's a function of what we've seen play out over the last six months in terms of mixed data that is causing this confusion. And the way it's manifesting in our space is this reluctance of sellers to transact at what is reflective of the cost of capital environment today. And so for us, this is one of the advantages we bring to the table is we play in multiple geographies. And we are seeing much better risk-adjusted return opportunities in Europe today, where the data has been a lot more consistent, and therefore, the ability to transact with potential sellers much more real. And that's kind of the reason why you've seen 54% of the volume manifest itself in Europe versus here in the US. And I suspect, because your question was very specific around the current pipeline and what we think will happen in the second quarter, I suspect it will be a similar slant to the results. But I do believe that the second half of the year, we should start to see a lot more transactions materialize. I know that the team is actually in conversations with multiple potential sellers, but the disconnect happens to be where that reservation price is for potential sellers. But we do believe that once the environment becomes a little clearer in terms of what's going to happen with rates and when will those potential rate cuts come to fruition, I think the transaction market in the US will catch up.
Nate Crossett: Okay. That's helpful. And then if I could just ask one on the tenant credit side. What's on the watchlist right now that we should be tracking and maybe you could speak to Red Lobster, specifically because that's been in the news recently
Sumit Roy: Sure. So the ones that we currently have on our watchlist, Rite Aid, that represents about 31 basis points of rent. It's still going through bankruptcy. We are very hopeful that it will emerge from bankruptcy soon. But like I said, it's a very small portion of our overall portfolio. Joan is another one that was on our -- is on our watchlist. That represents 4 basis points of rent and our expectation is that all six leases are going to be assumed at 100% recapture, just given the way they're planning on emerging from bankruptcy. Every other name that's on our watchlist is sub-4% in terms of names that are currently in bankruptcy. So it's a -- it's obviously a very, very small portion of our overall watchlist. The ones that are not on -- not currently in bankruptcy but continue to garner a fair amount of interest here internally, is Red Lobster, the one that you just mentioned. We have about 216 leases. It represents 1.07% of our rent. The cash flow coverage that we have across all 216 assets is right around two times and 201 of these 216 leases happen to be part of a master lease. So I just wanted to frame our exposure to Red Lobster, before I go into some color around the name itself. I think of Red Lobster is -- it's a pretty strange story. They have 700 unique locations. They garner 14% of the casual seafood concept. That is a very hard thing to do. And the fact that they generate north of $2 billion in revenue, if you look at it on a per unit basis, that's just right around $3.5 million per unit. So it's not a top line issue, as much as it is an operations issue. They've gone through several changes in terms of ownership. Obviously, there have been several changes in terms of management. And this is a business that, in our opinion, hasn't been very well run. If you look at the balance sheet, is it a balance sheet issue at Red Lobster. In our opinion, it's not. They have $220 million of debt and this is really a question of, is there an operator out there that could come in and basically manage this business even to a reasonable level of margins. Today, I don't believe they're generating a whole lot of EBITDA. But having said that, our 200 assets has two times coverage. So that should tell you that we obviously have assets that are some of the best assets in their portfolio. And so if this can be operationally rightsized, we believe that this is a concept that should come out, and should survive and do quite well, given the footprint that they've been able to establish. So, that's our view. We are keeping a close eye on it. As far as rents are concerned, we've collected 100% of the rents due to us as of May. So, it's a wait and see, but it does happen to be on our watch list.
Operator: The next question comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Greg McGinniss: Hey Sumit. Are you able to provide more details on the active disposition program you're talking about maybe in terms of targeted volumes industries or how you're identifying assets for recycling?
Sumit Roy: Sure. Good question, Greg. So, what we are hoping to achieve is circa $400 million to $500 million of asset dispositions this year. We can't be very precise around it because part of it is a function of the market. We expect that the occupied sales and the vacant asset sales is going to be approximately 50/50. Obviously, in the first quarter, it was disproportionately vacant asset sales. I think $82 million of the $96 million was vacant asset sales, $14 million were occupied. But what we are trying to do is intentionally get ahead of some of these assets that happen to be on our watch list. And not always is it being driven by a credit issue. It's -- sometimes it is purely a real estate issue that our asset management team has concluded, does not have a long-term position in our overall portfolio. And then there are certain trends that we are seeing that we want to try to get ahead of based on client conversations, et cetera, that is also going to allow us to be a lot more proactive and get ahead of situations, well in advance of it becoming an issue downstream. In terms of the actual concepts themselves, it is along the lines of what we have been selling. Some of it is automotive services. There are some drug stores that we believe are not part of the overall strategy. Some of it is going to be the Cineworld assets that, by the way, the sale process is going, I would say, ahead of what our expectations were. And then some that are perhaps not, like I said, core to what our overall strategy is on the discount store side as well that we want to try to get ahead of. So, those are the components that will make up what we want to try to get disposed of this year.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. And is that $400 million to $500 million the kind of entirety of the program? Is that a first step? And then how are you thinking about as that compares to the level of acquisitions that you're targeting this year, what that might mean for growth in 2025?
Sumit Roy: Look, we've got to execute our plan based on what we believe is the right portfolio that's going to take us into 2025 in a position of strength. We have grown our business through M&A. There have been two very large M&A deals done in the last two and a half, three years. We've been, I believe, very open about not all of those assets have been core to our long-term strategy. And so some of this is largely a function of trying to get back to that core portfolio. We have obviously underwritten the impact of 50% of circa $400 million to $500 million in dispositions being occupied assets. But what you'll find is some of these assets are actually being sold. Look at what we sold or -- and I know it wasn't a big number, but the occupied assets, we actually sold them at a 7% cap rate, cash cap rate and we are reinvesting it at 77%. So it is actually an accretive disposition strategy that we've been able to implement at least for the first quarter. So for us, it's about creating the portfolio that we want to go into 2025 and beyond with. And this is a program that will consistently be executed on going forward. When we are doing sale leasebacks, it's not an issue. When we're doing portfolio transactions on existing leases, not always do we get 100% of what we want. And so being a bit more proactive around culling the assets that is not core to our overall strategy upfront is something that I think we are going to be a lot more intentional about. But we feel very good about our ability to continue to grow despite the strategy in 2025 and beyond.
Operator: The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good afternoon. This is Farrell [ph] on behalf of Josh. I was wondering if you could clarify how bad debt is currently trending. I know you made some comments on the watch list. And perhaps if that has changed at all in your outlook of how much bad debt is baked into guidance?
Jonathan Pong: Hey, Farrell, on the bad debt number, so we did disclose in the earnings press release for Q1, it was about $1.4 million that we actually recognized. As we think about forward-looking guidance and downside scenarios. I think we've been pretty clear in the past that we've been extremely conservative. I think when you sit here today, it's early May, it's a long time to go before the end of the year -- it's not to say that there's any major concerns. I think you heard some talk about the watch list and it's a bunch of small little things that if everything when a yes, maybe could have some impact, but it's certainly not our expected scenario on that front. And so I think it's really a mix of spirits assets that we did acquire that we've always been a little bit more cautious on, and we'll continue to be cautious until we get further into the year. I think for us, we're always pretty conservative as it relates to bad debt expense, especially early in the year. And then finally, there's some identified credits that even more or coating on.
Unidentified Analyst : Great. And second question about given the cap rates that you're seeing in Europe with coming off of acquisitions, has your thought process or thesis change when you're thinking about development and the yield you can get off that versus these straight-up acquisitions.
Sumit Roy: No, it's a matter of timing, Farrell as the older vintage developments start to roll off, you'll start to notice that some of the newer developments that we've entered into are more reflective of the current cost of capital environment and therefore, the cash cap rate yields that we are expecting on that vintage should creep up. It's just that we entered into our development pipeline 12, 18 months ago. And some of those assets obviously were more reflective of the environment that we were in at that particular point in time. But even at a 7.2% cash cap yield, which is what our development is -- that closed in the first quarter yielded is still circa 150 basis points, 170 basis points of spread. So yes, it's not quite the 7.8% that we were able to achieve on the overall and certainly not 8.2% that we were able to achieve in Europe. But that -- I just wanted to make sure that you are aware that there is a bit of a lag on the development pipeline and the developments that we are entering into today is much more reflective of the environment today.
Operator: The next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Yes, thanks. Hi everybody. Going back to the European cap rates, it really felt like that market has lagged the US for a long time in terms of recognizing the higher rate environment. I appreciate the outlook has been a bit more stable over there. But is there anything else that's changed in Europe that's now generating these attractive cap rates despite the cost of debt obviously being lower than the US.
Sumit Roy: Yes, Brad, what the cost of debt is certainly lower in Mainland Europe. It's not lower in the UK. I would say trying on top of each other, John. Jonathan is nodding. So the big difference that we see and why potential sellers are willing to transact at the yields that we were able to realize, they're twofold. One, there are funds that have had redemption pressures where they need to monetize real estate, and they are more than willing to reflect what the current cost of capital environment is because they need the capital. And the second, which works really in our favor is the fact that we have established ourselves as the go-to buyer of these types of assets and recognizing that the surety of close, which is very important for these potential sellers is going to be met. And that reputation really does accrue to our benefit, when we are sort of having these conversations, and somebody requires capital near term, and we have the ability to close on these transactions as and when we agree on a particular price. I think it's those 2 factors that's allowing us to be very successful in the UK and in Europe, and is how it's playing out. Here, unfortunately, you don't have similar pressures. Yes, there could be operators that might be willing to transact. But if they have any ability to wait, which in the US, they have a lot more alternatives, they are sort of standing on the sidelines, waiting for the environment to improve for potential buyers to then be able to get the cap rates that they're willing to transact in. So I think that's how I would frame, why we are being successful. One of the reasons is obviously very idiosyncratic to us and the other is it's a reflection of the market.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. Thank you for that. And then on Dollar Tree Family Dollar, can you remind us what the Family Dollar split is? And talk about any impact that you might have from the closures?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Look, I don't think that the impact for us is going to be disproportionate. We have about 3% of our rent that is Dollar Tree, Family Dollar exposed to Dollar Tree, which obviously is the owner of Family Dollar. And I would say about 60%, circa 60% is Family Dollar and the rest of it is either Dollar Tree or the dual banners that they have. There's about, I want to say 3% of the 3.3%. So that's nine basis points of lease expirations over the next two years, 2.5 years that will materialize. So even if there are these closures and even if some of these assets are named on the closing list, our impact is basically nine basis points. And I can assure you that our asset management team is already working on resolutions given that it is part of the pipeline. Anything beyond that will potentially be closed and will remain dark. We are still going to collect rent. And let me tell you that the pressure on Family Dollar and Dollar Tree is going to be a lot more acute than it is on us to try to find a substitute to step in and take over these leases. And just episodically, there's a fair amount of interest in some of these locations that we've received just along the lines of some of the news that's out there about potential closings, et cetera that we feel pretty good about our ability to resolve the Family Dollar assets. The one thing I'll add, which may not be apparent, Family Dollar tends to be in urban areas and in much more densely populated areas than Dollar Tree or Dollar General. And so the attractiveness of those locations to alternative retail clients is a lot more, and that's borne out by the fact that we have received inbound. So for us, this is no different than learning well in advance that, hey, these particular leases are not going to get renewed and it gives us time to work on some of these leases well in advance of the actual lease expiration. So that's how I would frame it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Katherine Grey [ph] on with Michael. Thanks for taking my questions. My first is, you touched on this a bit at the opening, but how are you thinking about -- if you could maybe just provide some more color, how you're thinking about the cost of free cash flow within the context of your investment spreads?
Sumit Roy: Sure. That's a great question. For us, free cash flow is a massive advantage. The ability to raise $825 million of free cash flow post all obligations is essentially capital that we can use to invest across a variety of areas to accretively grow our earnings. Obviously, when we have free cash flow, we have to figure out what is the best use of that free cash flow. We could buy back our debt, we could buy back our stock, we could continue to invest accretively. And when we find that investing accretively is the best possible use of that capital -- that is a massive advantage. And in a year where we are highlighting the fact that we have $2 billion of acquisitions, and we hope we do better than that, but that's our current guidance. Being able to finance this business with $825 million of free cash flow, which is obviously non-dilutive in nature and grow our earnings is a massive advantage. That's how we think about our free cash flow. There is obviously opportunity cost associated with this. But the way we think about opportunity cost is what's the best use of this capital. And for us, even in this environment, given the platform that we have, and given the diversification benefits of being able to invest across multiple asset types, across multiple geographies, we are continuing to find accretive use of this particular cash flow. And I think, obviously, one of the other things that we do look at is what is the long-term overall return profile. And that is what we compare to our long-term WACC, which is our cost of equity, that 65% and our cost of debt that is 35%. And the cost of equity -- and by the way, we have a few pages on this in our investor deck. It's largely driven by the CAPM model and the dividend growth model. And I think we take the average of the two to come up with our cost effective long-term cost of equity and the long-term cost of debt and it's 65%, 35% weighted. And all of our investments need to meet that hurdle rate and exceed that hurdle rate for us to move forward. So that's really how we think about our cost of capital and how we specifically think about the free cash flow, which obviously we view as a massive advantage to us.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks so much for the color. And my second question is on the development piece. So do you expect to see an acceleration of yields for your development projects as we progress through 2024 or even into 2025?
Sumit Roy: We do. Any new development that we are entering into, and I think somebody asked this question as well, we should -- it should be more reflective of the current cost of capital environment. And so as you know, a lot of these developments, they do have a bit of a lag time. And so what you're seeing close today is in that lower 7% ZIP code. But what you should see translate over the next few quarters is to see that cash cap rate continuing to trend much higher, reflecting the current cost of capital.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Paolone of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Anthony Paolone: Thanks. First question relates to the Europe acquisitions in the quarter and the yields there. Can you talk a bit more about what kinds of embedded rent bumps are included in that? How much was maybe traditional net lease versus maybe multi-tenant assets? Because it looked like duration was a little bit on the shorter side.
Sumit Roy: Yes. So a lot of these were retail parks. And let's talk a little bit about retail parks because there's a confusion when you say multi-tenanted, we think in terms of what -- how we define multi-tenanted here in the US. This is not like multi-tenanted here in the US. A lot of these are I would say 80% of them are Tier 1 or Tier 2 as we define them, clients that we are pursuing on a freestanding basis. And they happen to be located in a contiguous part. And each one of these units basically has a flow-through from rent to NOI, very similar to what you would find on a freestanding basis. So the growth in these leases, they tend to be shorter, anywhere between five to 10 years. And the growth in these leases could be open market reviews or they could have some of the larger boxes could have more of the regular way growth that we've seen that are tied to inflation, et cetera. But when we are underwriting these assets, we are looking at the composition of the tenants. We're looking at the flow through. We're looking at are these rents above or below market? We're looking at what the long-term profile of the return is going to be. And then we are comparing it to what are we getting these assets at day one in terms of the initial yield. And these assets have really done very well. And some of the numbers, a lot of the renewals come strong, these retail parks that we bought because the freestanding assets haven't gone through a renewal process yet. And the fact that they are very similar in nature to our overall portfolio of 104.3% that we were able to generate this quarter is a reflection of how we are underwriting each one of these retail parks. But that's where we are seeing the value. And the fact that we are now starting to consolidate and control swaps of retail parks across the UK is a massive advantage for us because the kind of conversations we can have with clients that we've obviously wanted to grow with is very different when we control major locations that they would like to continue to stay over the long duration. And I think that's how we are able to generate the value that we are able to generate. And we are doing it at a time point in time where should be told retail parks are starting to change. If you look at the vacancy that you have, it's circa 2%. If you look at the actual growth that we are being able to generate, it's much higher than what was traditionally achieved. And if you also look at the free rent concept that used to exist, we are being able to compress on that concept, just given the fact that we control so much more of retail parks. So this has been a great investment for us. And I just want to make sure that people realize that the flow-through is very similar to a stand-alone net lease business that we've traditionally been involved in. So I'm glad you asked the question, Anthony. Thank you.
Anthony Paolone: Thanks for all the color. And then just my follow-up is more on the credit side. You spent a bunch of time on that. But can you give us any updated thoughts on AMC, both as it relates to how you're thinking about that credit as well as your specific assets with the box office being down a bunch this year?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. So look, we've gone through one of them already with Cineworld. AMC represents about 1% of our rent. We have, I believe, 39 assets. AMC continues to be able to raise capital in the equity markets. And 2024 is not going to be a great year for the box office. We recognize that. It may be equivalent to last year, maybe it will be even a little bit less than last year given some of the disruptions that occurred in 2023. But the expectation is that 2025 will supersede 2023 and the quality of movie releases will be much higher in 2025 than in 2024. Is it possible that AMC goes through a BK process? Yes, it's absolutely possible. But I can tell you, our experience on Cineworld gives us a lot of confidence that the assets that we have and the resolutions that we've been able to achieve and the restructuring of the rent that was achieved is still going to create an outcome that is very acceptable to us. Tony, just to put things in perspective, our history, and we've had several bankruptcies in our history, our recapture rate has been north of 80%. And I believe if we were to do the full analysis, once we go full cycle on the Cineworld, it's going to be in that ZIP code. And it's not actually even better than that. given some of the resolutions that we are finding on the vacant asset sales that we had touched on last year on Cineworld. So, I believe AMC is going to be a similar story, but it is not trade comp that they're going to go through a BK process, we believe they have enough liquidity to certainly withstand this year and potentially most of next year as well. But if they were to go through a BK process, it's not necessarily a bad thing. I think it will allow them to restructure the debt, which I think continues to be a massive burden and they will emerge stronger for it. And we believe that, again, just like in the Cineworld situation, we have some of their better assets and we will do fairly well even if they were to go through the BK process. So, that's our thoughts on AMC.
Operator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning out there. Sumit, you mentioned thoughtful and disciplined growth selective a few times about your prepared remarks, clearly suggesting that the activity will remain subdued as you push the more yield and quality, but you did leave the door open in capacity in the gas a little bit more compelling opportunities to emerge in the back half of the year. So, I guess I'm curious maybe some more thoughts on that and how you think about balancing the pace of investment versus your longer term earnings growth target if you'd be willing to push a bit more in the second half, even if that would make -- right opportunities came along? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Hi Haendel, I'm sorry, it was very difficult to hear you. But I think what you're asking for is, do we expect to accelerate the investments in the latter half of the year given what we are seeing today? And if I didn't quite get that, I apologize. But the answer is, look, we are not trying to look for a particular quantum of acquisitions or investments, we are allowing for the market to dictate how much we'll be able to achieve in a year, which is very uncertain. If you're asking for an opinion, I do believe that especially here in the U.S., the second half of the year, when there is a little bit more clarity in terms of where interest rates are going, et cetera, there will be more opportunities. And Haendel, if you look at what we've been able to achieve over the last few years, we tend to get more than our share of the volume, especially of the product that we are interested in pursuing. And so is it possible that the U.S. acquisition numbers for the remainder of the year is going to be higher than what we achieved in the first quarter, the answer is yes. We certainly do. Do we expect the European momentum to continue? The answer is, yes. Do we expect both these markets to accelerate? The answer is, yes. And I just want to caveat it that this is our opinion, and time will tell. But we feel fairly optimistic about the second half of the year.
Haendel St. Juste : Thank you for that. And just a follow-up on Europe since we're talking about it here. I think you have close to $10 billion or so, plus or minus asset value there. So I guess I'm curious if there's any change or update on the thinking of a potential spin-off of that platform? Is it large or mature enough? And maybe when do you think that it could be ready to stand on its in? Thank you.
Sumit Roy: That was a loaded question, Haendel, but thank you for asking. The number is, I believe, closer to $11 billion. Yes, if we were to spin that business out, it would be one of the largest REITs in the U.K. But that is absolutely not our intention today. We are very happy with having Europe as part of our overall platform precisely for the reasons that we talked about on this call regarding the first quarter. It allows us the opportunity to play in markets where we have the best risk-adjusted return profiles of investments. And therefore, all of that benefit accrues to our shareholders here in the U.S. And so that's how I'm going to leave it. Again, was this a grand design that we would grow up to $10 billion? No. It's again a function of the platform that we brought in, our cost of capital, our team and their ability to execute unlike any other teams and our ability to form the relationships as quickly as we did and now we consider the de facto net lease company in all of Europe. I mean, those are benefits that has taken us five years to establish. And now we feel like is the time for us to continue to harvest the benefits of establishing ourselves in Europe. So that's how I would answer it.
Operator: The next question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph : Thanks. Given the opportunities that you've talked about in the better cap rates in Europe and kind of the thoughtfulness on the long-term weighted average cost of capital. How do additional data center and gaming investments look today on the U.S. side?
Sumit Roy: Thank you for your question, Nick. Yes, I would say about 6% of our investments in the first quarter went towards the digital JV that we have formed. As you may recall, Nick, that is an asset that is being currently developed in Northern Virginia, in Loudoun County. And it won't be operational until the end of this year, the first phase, maybe -- actually, it's the first quarter of next year. And then there could be the second phase that gets kicked in. So as of right now, that is the only investment that we have on the data center side. There are other opportunities that we are looking at. We do have an investment that we will make, we will continue to make in Spain, that is also looking at a data center side that we believe is very well located, and there seems to be a lot of interest in that particular side. That will be our additional spend on the data center side, but that hasn't been substantial to date. But those are really the only two opportunities that we are looking at. We are obviously involved in multiple conversations with multiple operators to try to understand where the real opportunities are versus the optimism that continues to play out in this particular space. And we are hopeful that we can grow our high percent part of our portfolio in a meaningful way over the next few years. But as of right now, a lot of it is just in the initial stages of conversations with potential operators outside of the JV that we have with digital.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And then just on the gaming side?
Sumit Roy: On the gaming side, things continue to look interesting. We've obviously made two investments. It represents slightly north of 3% of our rents and we are in conversations with other opportunities, including potential development opportunities in large cities. There's a very long tail to some of these development opportunities. But we'll see how some of these conversations translate into actual transactions. But I will say that there was an interesting conversation we were having earlier this year, which has been kind of put on hold for right now that would be a continued growth of our gaming business, but it hasn't quite materialized yet. So we'll see how that plays out.
Operator: The next question comes from Wes Golladay of Baird. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hi, everyone. You highlighted all the levers you have to pull. And when you created last year was the credit investment platform. Can you give us an update on that?
Sumit Roy: Yeah, Wes, we continue to look for opportunities on the credit investment side. But please keep in mind that one of the things that's dictating our investments in the credit side is to continue to strengthen relationships with either existing clients or to help facilitate sale leaseback with those existing clients. And if we want to be viewed as a real estate partner to some of the world's leading operators, part of being that partner is to provide capital through the traditional channels that we have established or on a more secured basis to balance sheet lending. And that continues to be how we think about our credit investment. But one of the advantages of doing this Wes, as I'm sure you recognize is this continuous headwinds that we experienced, given the refinancings that we are having to incur at much higher rates. This is a perfect natural hedge to that,, because here we are lending to clients that we have credit exposures to reflective of the current higher interest rate. And that's really part of why we believe that this is such a good strategy for us in the interim, people talk about reinvestment risk. Well, guess what, if the environment is different and interest rates actually go down. We don't have to roll our credit. Our cost of capital should be better. These headwinds that we are facing on our refinancings will dissipate. And we'll be able to, therefore, invest it in more of our traditional sources, this capital that we get back at very good yields. And so really, I think of the credit partly as a defensive mechanism and is a natural hedge to the headwinds that we faced, but also very much in line with trying to become that real estate partner to the world's leading operators, and these are operators with whom we want to continue to grow our relationship.
Wes Golladay: A quick follow-up on that one. So when you talk about the natural hedge, would you look to keep these more SOFR based loans?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. We do have software based loans. But by and large, what we try to do is not expose ourselves to the floating rate element. We try to lock it in, we get it but then no longer becomes a perfect hedge. But given where the environment is and given the expectation of interest rates, we are still very well protected. We have one loan, the ASDA loan that was -- it was -- it's a floater and it's off of the SONIA in the UK. But largely, every other loan that we've made has been a fixed component to it. And keep in mind that we also inherited some loans, one of which actually got paid off at 100% that we inherited from Spirit, and it was a $33 million seller financing that Spirit had provided to imagine, which, by the way, was an outcome that was superior to how we had underwritten it. So yeah, it's -- Jonathan, do you want to add something?
Jonathan Pong: Yes. Well, just to add to that, when we think about it in a natural hedge, I think it's more so a lot of lines of lenders that actually matures, because we look at our maturity schedule, we've got a decent amount of debt coming to well staggered, but on a nominal basis, still pretty significant, $1.9 billion next year, for instance, or $3.26 billion at almost $3 billion in 2027. And so when you have a corresponding asset that could get cold or will get repaid and it's hard to replace that coupon in a lower rate environment, chances are we're much better off as we're refinancing our liabilities and our cost of capital is obviously much lower. So I think that's another way to take through the natural hedge element.
Operator: Our next question comes from Harsh Hemnani of Green Street. Please go ahead.
Harsh Hemnani: Thank you. So not a good jump of acquisitions this quarter came from ones that needed the capital and some redemptions. How would you contrast that opportunity set for acquisitions versus maybe the traditional sale-leaseback market when realty income could provide a solution for [indiscernible] financing. It sounds like based on interest rate hopes -- hopes of interest going down, more tenants are looking towards the traditional credit market and trying to look for finite sources of capital rather than locking in sale-leaseback capital for a perpetual period of time. Is that something you're seeing more so in tenant conversations today than compared to a year ago?
Sumit Roy: We are certainly seeing sale-leaseback opportunities. In fact, 13% of what we closed in the first quarter, it was sale-leaseback. But you're right, Harsh. If you compare it to last year, 46% of everything we did was sale leaseback. The year before that, it was closer to 40%. And we are not seeing that. And I think part of it is because clients are trying to figure out ways to not necessarily lock into 20-year, 25-year leases at these elevated cap rates. And so if there is an alternative available to them, be it through the debt markets, which has much shorter duration, even if it is higher, I think they're going to be far more inclined to doing that. But I just want to be very clear that we are -- again, if it's a brand-new client that we don't have a relationship with, we are not going to go and provide them credit if there isn't a compelling sale-leaseback opportunity with them and our desire to have them as part of our client registry is not there. We are not going to be pure credit providers like some of the credit funds out there that exist. So, I do see that changing as there is stability in the rate environment, as people start to get much more comfortable about where things are going to sort of play out, I do believe that sale-leaseback will come roaring back. We are in discussions with some names right now. And it really is a disconnect between where they want to transact and what -- where we are capable of transacting given our cost of capital. So -- but I think it's a matter of time.
Harsh Hemnani: Thanks for that. I'll leave it there.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Harsh.
Operator: And our next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi, thank you. Maybe piggybacking off Greg's earlier question on dispositions, your proprietary predictive analytics platform will be used to help with dispose. Could you just give us some more color on how that works? What are some of the inputs to the analysis?
Sumit Roy: Yes. That's where the secret sauce is, Linda. But all right. Let me -- and I don't want to get to pedantic, so try to keep it pretty high level. The way our predictive analytics were it is by industry and even at times by client. But largely, the models work by industry. And it tries to identify the key variables, which could be 20, 30, 40 variables that dictate the predictability of a renewal outcome or a leasing outcome. So the pieces around how we created the predictive analytic tool was to figure out, what was our leasing activity going to look like, where will we -- the risk was defined as, are we going to be able to maintain the rent that we currently have during a renewal period? Or are we -- is it going to go less? Or is it going to be more -- and that's how we define risk, and that's how we've sort of created these algorithms by industry to identify where does risk lie in our portfolio. And as you can imagine, each industry has its own set of variables that dictate that particular outcome. But the biggest piece of all of this. I think the creation of the algorithms, et cetera, is a fairly simple task. I mean it's taken us 3.5, four years. So I don't want to minimize that piece. I've got me looking at me strangely here. But it is the data that we have that allowed us to back test these models and continue to refine and calibrate these models to improve their predictability. I think that's what is whether the true value lies in our platform, having been around for 50 years. And I think that's why you see the kind of results that you see when we are posting the release -- the re-leasing spreads, when we are trying to get ahead in terms of identification of assets that we should, where we are maximizing the return profile of those assets given what we think will happen some lease renewal. I think that's where the predictive analytics tools, along with the asset management team was using on-the-ground experience to sort of share their perspective along with the credit view, that group together is what's dictating how we try to stay ahead with the portfolio. And it's -- it has to be tools driven. It has to be technology driven. When you have 15,400 discrete locations with in 80 different industries with 1,500 different clients I mean it can't be done manually. And so that's the reason why we chose to make this investment Linda, five years ago and several millions in -- this is a tool that we are very, very proud of. And it's now very much part and parcel of every decision we are making. Be it acquisitions, be it disposition, the hold decisions and also, this tool is now being used to dictate the highest and best use for potential vacancies, which may or may not be the old use of that particular asset. And we've seen some of the value creation that, that prediction has yielded for us as a platform. So hopefully, I didn't get too much into the details, but that's really how the pretty expanded tool works
Linda Tsai: Appreciate the color. And then just in terms of using dispose to get back to that core portfolio you referenced earlier, can you give us some metrics or characteristics of what that looks like. You have more international exposure versus four or five years ago? How does that kind of fit to the core portfolio?
Sumit Roy: Yes. For us, having geographical diversification, the advantages of it played out in the first quarter, right? I mean you saw we were able to find transactions in the UK that had a return profile that far superseded what we are able to find here in the US. And then that will flip, so I think the geographical diversity is a good thing. In terms of the actual composition of the portfolio, we clearly have what we are viewing as an optimal portfolio. And an optimal portfolio, we might like, let's call it, grocery. But we want grocery to be 13% to 14% of our overall portfolio. If that creeps into the 19% to 20%, that's not a good thing. And by the way, I'm giving you an example, that's not the case, grocery happens to be only 10% of our portfolio today. And then there are other areas like apparel that we may not necessarily want to be exposed to at all. But again, using very broad brushes across particular subsectors is not the right answer either. And that's the reason why this tool along with credit, et cetera, they help us devise what we believe to be the optimal portfolio. If you think retail and you step back, we like service-oriented businesses. We like low price point businesses. And -- that's sort of the overarching nondiscretionary overarching elements that we look for on the retail side. That doesn't mean that we won't deviate from this. But over 90% of our retail portfolio, by the way, has one or more of these characteristics. But that's, I think, how you think about the composition and geographical diversification is something that sits on top of that.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking soon and seeing you at the upcoming conferences. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-21 14:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Bakke, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, sir.
Steve Bakke: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-K. We'll be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone. Our fourth quarter and 2023 full-year results demonstrate the unique platform value that Realty Income has built, which differentiates us as a real estate partner to the world's leading companies. During the year, we accomplished several milestones, which illustrate the benefits bestowed to us by our size, scale and relationships. First, we set an annual high in property level investment volume closing on over $9.5 billion in high-quality diversified investments across eight different countries and through 271 discrete transactions at a weighted average cash yield of 7.1%. The year was punctuated with a particularly active fourth quarter as we closed on $2.7 billion of investments at a weighted average cash yield of 7.6%. Our fourth quarter activity included a $527 million sale leaseback transaction with Decathlon, one of the world's leading investment-grade rated sporting goods retailers and included properties located in Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Portugal. Despite a volatile capital markets environment, we achieved an investment spread of approximately 115 basis points in the fourth quarter and approximately 120 basis points in 2023. We were able to achieve these spreads without sacrificing our focus on the quality of real estate or security of cash flow, which is a testament to our experienced team and the merits that sophisticated sellers see in transacting with our platform. Second, during the year we established a presence in the data center sector through a build-to-suit development joint venture with Digital Realty. And we incubated new relationships with blue-chip partners such as Blackstone and the EG Group through large scale investments, including the $950 million investment for a 21.9% stake in the Bellagio and the $1.5 billion sale leaseback involving primarily Cumberland Farm convenience stores. Third, and in addition to the achievements noted above, we also announced the $9.3 billion merger with Spirit Realty Capital in an all-stock transaction in October, which closed subsequent to year-end on January 23. These accomplishments contributed to our 2023 AFFO per share of $4, representing an approximately 7% total operational return for the year, and importantly, together with the Spirit merger, set us up to deliver a compelling earnings growth backdrop in 2024. We believe that the close of the Spirit merger last month along with meaningful debt and equity capital raising activity completed at attractive prices in December and January that Jonathan will describe in more detail, leave us well-positioned to deliver robust growth in 2024. We here initiated an AFFO per share guidance range of $4.13 to $4.21 per share for 2024, which represents an annual growth rate of 4.3% at the midpoint. We believe we can achieve this growth rate without the selling of additional public equity. Inclusive of our dividend, this positions us to deliver a total operational return of more than 10% at the midpoint of the guidance range based on the trading price of our common stock as of February 20, 2024. In addition to the $9.3 billion Spirit merger, we're also providing 2024 acquisitions guidance of approximately $2 billion, which is expected to be fully funded via a combination of our portfolios internally generated cash flow now exceeding $800 million after dividend payments on an annualized basis, as well as approximately $605 million of unsettled ATM proceeds and our $3.7 billion of cash and unutilized availability on our revolving credit facility as of year-end. While we continue to source and review high-quality investment opportunities, we remain highly selective deploying capital only into attractive risk adjusted return opportunities that meet both our near-term and long-term investment spread requirements. Of our $2 billion initial investment volume forecast, approximately half is expected to come in the form of development financing, the vast majority of which is already identified. To reiterate, our favorable return profile in 2024 carries very little execution risk from an investment standpoint, allowing us the flexibility to remain patient, disciplined and opportunistic from a capital deployment standpoint. That said, as we demonstrated during the height of the pandemic, our platform affords us the opportunity to pivot quickly back into growth mode should market conditions change. While we intend to remain disciplined in our investments to ensure appropriate risk-adjusted returns for our investors, we continue to highlight why we are best positioned to capitalize on compelling opportunities over the long term. First, the opportunity to consolidate the fragmented net lease real estate market is vast. We estimate $14 trillion total addressable market in the U.S. and Europe across traditional net lease and emerging verticals like data centers and gaming. Second, we have firmly demonstrated our capabilities deploying capital, having invested $9 billion or more including public M&A in each of the last three years since exiting the pandemic year of 2020. Over this time, we have generated annualized AFFO per share growth of approximately 6% and we have provided a total operational return to stockholders of approximately 10% per year. Looking to 2024 and beyond, we are on track to achieve similar capital deployment and AFFO per share growth objectives this year. We are particularly energized by the prospect to participate meaningfully in verticals like data centers and gaming, where we are seeing opportunities to earn healthy initial yields with attractive contractual rent escalators. Third, the Spirit merger deepens our ability to access capital markets through increased trading volume in our publicly-listed stock, which has averaged more than $400 million of daily trading volume since the Spirit transaction was announced. This places us in the top 150 of S&P 500 companies and is more than 7x the net lease peer average over the same timeframe, leaving us even better situated to fund our business in a highly efficient and non-disruptive manner through our ATM equity program. Fourth, our real estate portfolio is becoming increasingly diversified over time and consists of properties leased to relationship clients representing some of the world's leading companies in their respective industries. Diversified exposure to these clients reinforces the stability of our platform and accordingly are growing monthly dividend payments. Finally, the power of our platform is a crucial differentiator as we leverage our expertise across ownership of over 15,400 properties globally, inclusive of the Spirit portfolio. Our experience managing over 5,900 lease outcomes since 1996 provides learnings that feed into analytic AI tools that provide actionable insights, enabling us to more accurately identify acquisition opportunities and to maximize the value of our existing holdings. Continuing with our key operational results from the fourth quarter, investment volume of approximately $2.7 billion was allocated to high-quality investments at a weighted average cash yield of approximately 7.6%. We completed $1.1 billion of total investment volume internationally at a weighted average cash yield of 7.8%. Investments were made across 119 distinct transactions, including 29 sale leaseback transactions equating to $884 million of volume. Our full year investment activity was $9.5 billion, of which 35% was derived internationally, serving as a testament to the value of our investment platform’s global footprint. Included in fourth quarter volume was a loan we made to ASDA stores in the UK at a 10.9% yield. The loan is backed by ownership interests and properties containing grocery stores and supermarkets and was extended as part of a sale leaseback transaction with ASDA. In addition, fourth quarter volume included our previously announced $650 million of preferred equity investment in the Bellagio JV with Blackstone, which earns an 8.1% yield. Similar to the loan investment in ASDA, the Bellagio preferred equity investment was paired with investment in high-quality real estate. For both investments, our ability to offer a broadened suite of capital solutions to clients granted us access to high-quality net lease real estate investments at superior risk adjusted returns than we could have otherwise achieved. These transactions serve as templates for future sale leaseback transactions. Also in the fourth quarter, we made our initial investment in a data center development JV with Digital Realty. The initial $200 million investment represents an 80% equity investment in the venture and is expected to generate a 6.9% initial cash yield, 2% annual rent escalators and a long-term triple-net lease with an S&P 100 investment grade client upon completion. Turning to portfolio operations, same-store rent grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter and 1.9% for the year, benefiting in part from lower net bad debt expense compared to the prior year. On a normalized basis, our contractual rent growth approximates 1.5% on an annual basis based on the current composition of our portfolio. This amount is up over 50 basis points from just five years ago and is a result of an intentional push by our team to generate enhanced organic growth. We remain committed to walking this growth rate higher over time through our deliberate underwriting strategy. Our diligent asset management efforts led to a recapture rate of 103.6% during the quarter and 104.1% for the year excluding the impact of the Cineworld bankruptcy. At year-end, occupancy was 98.6%, a 20 basis point decline from the prior quarter as a result of expected client move outs. I will now turn it over to Jonathan who will add further color to the quarter.
Jonathan Pong: Thank you, Sumit. We completed an active quarter in the capital markets during the fourth quarter raising $1.6 billion of equity at a weighted average price of $56.25. Including activity subsequent to year-end, we currently have approximately $605 million of outstanding forward equity available to finance a portion of our equity needs in 2024. When combined with over $800 million of annual free cash flow available to us following the Spirit merger, we have the ability to finance all of our equity needs for our $2 billion investments guidance without having to tap into the public equity markets for the remainder of 2024. And this is before any capital recycling opportunities throughout the sales, which we expect to be north of the $116 million volume we achieved in 2023. As Sumit mentioned earlier, our AFFO per share guidance midpoint implies 4.3% annual growth and assumes only $2 million of investments volume, with almost half are re-accounted for in our development pipeline. From a debt capital market standpoint, we de-risked our 2024 maturity schedule through approximately $2.2 billion of bond issuance activity in a 45-day span, beginning with our GBP 750 million sterling notes offering in December and culminating in our US$1.25 billion offering that closed last month. Combined, the two offerings blend to a weighted average tenure of approximately 10.2 years and weighted average yield to maturity of approximately 5.5%. Near-term, these two offerings allow us to fund our business given our current investment outlook without needing to tap into the debt capital markets in 2024, which we believe was a prudent approach given the persistent instability that has permeated the capital markets over the last two years. There are also longer term strategic considerations that dictated this approach. Following our debut euro offerings in the summer of 2023, we believe these offerings also support our steadfast desire to maintain investor diversification across our multi currency debt complex, while pocketing future debt repayment risk in years with meaningful capacity. Last month, we also exercised the first of two one-year extension options available to us on our $1.1 billion multi currency term loan that we established in January of 2023. In conjunction with the extension, we entered into a two-year floating to fixed interest rate swap that effectively locked in a fixed rate of approximately 4.85% on this principle through its maturity date in January 2026. In conjunction with the closing of the Spirit merger, we also assumed $1.3 billion of term loan debt from Spirit, as well as $1.3 billion in existing floating to fixed interest rate swaps, which resulted in an effective weighted average fixed rate of 3.9% on that debt. Of this term loan principal, $800 million matures in 2025 and $500 million matures in 2027. Moving on to key credit metrics at year end, we finished the year with net debt to annualized pro form EBITDA of 5.5x, in line with our targeted leverage ratio and this excludes the $605 million of outstanding forward equity we currently have available to us. Our fixed charge coverage finished the year at 4.7x, which was the high watermark for us in 2023, benefiting from higher investment yields in the fourth quarter and less and lower cost short-term borrowings outstanding. In 2024, we do anticipate an increase of $45 million in annualized non-cash interest expense we expect to recognize from the amortization of below market debt on the Spirit debt we assumed. Note that this non-cash interest expense adjustment does lower annual FFO per share run rate by approximately $0.05 per share, but is not reflected in AFFO, thus explaining the primary reason why our initial FFO and AFFO guidance ranges are more closely bound than in 2023. We would note that purchase price accounting adjustments are ongoing for the merger and thus straight line rents and FAS 141 adjustments from the merger are likely to push FFO higher once finalized, and we will adjust our FFO guidance at that time. Of course, these are non-cash adjustments that do not impact AFFO. Looking forward, I would like to reiterate Sumit's opening comments about our lack of reliance on the capital markets to fund our growth in 2024. From a liquidity perspective, we view our near-term capital availability as a strength of following our bond yield last month, we had into the rest of 2024 with approximately $4 billion of liquidity at year-end, variable rate debt representing less than 5% of our total debt capital stack and no capital market execution risk to fund our growth for the remainder of 2024. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sumit for closing remarks.
Sumit Roy : Thank you, Jonathan. Before concluding, I would like to extend my immense gratitude to Ron Merriman for his valued service to Realty Income on our Board of Directors the past 19 years. Ron's leadership, guidance and mentorship have been invaluable and we all owe him our sincere thanks. I would also like to extend a warm welcome to Jeff Jacobson, who will be joining our Board. I'm thrilled for all of us at Realty Income to benefit from Jeff's perspective as a former CEO of one of the world's premier global real estate asset management firms, LaSalle Investment Management and in his current role as the Chairman of the Board of Cadillac Fairview Corporation. In conclusion, our results in 2023 underscore the multiple avenues of growth at our disposal in the global commercial real estate industry, including through one-off and portfolio acquisitions, multiple asset types, corporate sale leasebacks, development and joint venture partnerships and via public M&A opportunities. The depth of our platform, team and relationships enable us to leverage some or all of these sourcing avenues concurrently as opportunities arise. In 2023, we completed five transactions greater than $500 million in size and two of which were greater than $1 billion excluding the Spirit merger. These are transactions that Realty Income was uniquely positioned to execute given our size, scale and access to capital globally. These distinct competitive advantages support us in serving as real estate partner to the world's leading companies at an unparalleled scale. Moreover, we believe that serving as capital provider to a diverse spectrum of clients, who are leaders in their respective industries, furthers our core mission to deliver dependable monthly dividends that grow over time. We will now open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. First question is just on the acquisition guidance. You're starting the year with $2 billion of acquisitions. It sounds like you have visibility into half of them. Really like the execution risk for the year is only for $1 billion. What has to change in order for that number to kind of move higher through the year? Is it interest rates? Is it opportunities that come to you? Is it your ability to use to do deals kind of like what you've done with the Bellagio with preferred equity or with the loan with ASDA to get it done? Like, how should we think about the potential for upside for that number and that number moving higher through the year?
Sumit Roy: Thank you for that question, Michael. It's a lot of what you just said. If you look at the market today and you look at the cap rate environment, the adjustments that we have seen has not been commensurate with the movement in the cost of capital. And we are coming out with a business plan that basically says, okay, these two variables that we don't control are not going to be part of how we deliver the 4.3% growth and north of 10% total return growth. And that's the reason for the numbers that we have shared with you. If the cap rates were to adjust, we will be first in line to take advantage of that. If the interest rate environments were to start to go down, which would then have an impact on our cost of capital, i.e., lower cost of capital, we would be first in line to react. We wanted to come out with a business plan that had no reliance on the capital markets on the funding side and come up with a number which we all believe very, very confidently that we will be able to meet, if not exceed. If the environment were to change, i.e., interest rate were to start to go down et cetera, which would have a positive impact on our cost of capital. Do believe that a lot of the conversations that we are having, so it's not the conversations that have dried up, it's the expectation in the market around what the reservation price needs to be that needs to move. And that can happen either through the movement of cap rates or through our cost of capital getting better. And right now, we feel very confident in saying the plan that we have has very little to no risk and we can deliver a 10% plus return without having to be aggressive in the market. And that's really the thesis around what we've come out with.
Michael Goldsmith: No. That's helpful, Sumit. And then if we think about -- as my follow-up question, not to be -- we still have a lot to get through with '24. So this question isn't necessarily specific to '25, but just like the philosophy of if the environment stays kind of in a similar-ish range than where it is right now, where you just there isn't a lot of deals getting done. The transaction market remains kind of murky, you've driven. You've locked in growth for '24 through an acquisition. How would you think about -- how would you think about navigating through a multi -- a potentially multi-year kind of murky environment? Yes, exactly. How do you plan on navigating through a multi-year murky environment, if that was the case?
Sumit Roy: So Michael, the reason I believe that cap rates haven't moved is because of the volatility in the market. If there was certainty that, hey, this cost of capital environment is going to remain at these elevated levels for the next three years, guess what? Cap rates will adjust, will move, and there will be more willingness on the part of the seller to transact today. We had the tenure at a 4.2 towards the end of last year, it dropped down to 3.75 in January, and then it's back up to 4.2. In that sort of environment, you have sellers that are saying, we expect the Fed to start cutting interest rate later in the year. I think it can hold off another six to seven months. So why transact in this environment today? And I think that's the reason why we have hesitation and lack of this widespread movement in cap rates that one would expect if people were to bind to the fact that this cost of capital environment has been permanently impaired. So I think in this scenario that you've sort of dictated, if that were to be the norm and if everybody were to accept that, that, hey, for the next three years, the cost of capital environment is not going to change, I do think transactions are going to come back. I do think cap rates will move much more than they have done so. And yes, we'll be the ones first in line to take advantage of that.
Operator: And our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with BOA Merrill Lynch.
Joshua Dennerlein: I appreciate the time. Just wanted to -- I had a question on the development funding. How do we think about the NOI from that development funding coming online? Do you only get NOI or return once the project is finished? Or do you get like a return as the money is kind of drawn down for that development?
Jonathan Pong: Josh, this is Jonathan. One way to think about it because the answer is really going to vary depending on the lease. But if we're doing a development takeout, obviously, we put the funds down when the project is done, we get those assets and the rent starts and there's really no lag. If it's a development build-to-suit we're funding along the way. A little bit more nuance associated with that, where you're not quite getting the economics that we are entitled to as we put this funding out. However, from an accounting standpoint, the way that it flows through to the income statement is through essentially our cost of short-term debt. And so from a modeling perspective, the most clean way to do it, in my view, would be to just assume when you see us developing and deploying capital, that's when the yield begins because in most cases, that's going to be the case.
Sumit Roy: Yes, the vast majority of the pipeline are takeouts, Josh. So this is really entering into a forward contract. We are not deploying capital as the assets being developed. And once it's developed and the certificate of occupancy is received, we are essentially buying the asset at that point. And obviously, rent is commencing at that point. So that's how one should think about the development pipeline.
Joshua Dennerlein: And I appreciate all that color. Maybe one more on development. I guess just how do we think about development as kind of like when you look across like your appetite to acquire new assets, like how do you think about like development? Is this something you're going to lean into more? There are better yields on developments versus just straight-up acquisitions. Just kind of curious.
Sumit Roy: Yes. It's just yet another tool that is available to us to drive growth, Josh. That's how we think about development. We have existing client relationships. They have aggressive plans of expansion. They come to us and they say, hey, we are working with this developer. Would you be interested in getting slightly higher yields than what the market would dictate if this asset were available today? And would you lend your balance sheet to help us expand? And that is part of how we are building out our development pipeline because the expectation is that the yield one can generate through development should be superior to what one could get in the transaction market if that asset were fully operational today. That was the thesis. Now obviously, you might see that some of the yields that we have posted on these developments were slightly lower than what we were able to get in the acquisitions market, and this is largely a function of how quickly the cost of capital environment changed and the adjustments that did take place on the cap rate side, but on the way down on the cost of capital side, this will also manifest itself as a positive to what the markets are going to be. So for instance, the types of transactions we are entering into today on the development side, we'll have -- will be reflective of the yield environment today. And if the cost of capital were to improve, let's say, a year from now to 1.5 years from now, when these assets get delivered, there will be a positive spread that you should see on the development yields versus the -- at that time, cap rates that are transacting in the market. So this is really yet another tool. This will never be a dominant part of our business, but it is certainly a tool that if we want to view ourselves as the real estate partners to leading operators. This is a tool that we want to also provide to our clients to help them grow their business.
Joshua Dennerlein: Got it. And if I can sneak one more in. Sorry about that. Does your -- I know your guide is only $2 billion, but when you think about your broader pipeline, are there a lot of portfolio deals out there? Like bigger transactions out there? I know they take a while to close. Just kind of curious.
Sumit Roy: So Josh, I think I tried to hint that on the last conversation when somebody asked about what are you seeing, what's driving the movement in the market. I can tell you that we are continuing to have a multitude of conversations with our clients, where there's a disconnect is what is the price at which they are willing to transact. And that's where the disconnect is. So it's not that suddenly we are not talking to our clients. We, in fact, one of our largest clients, we spoke with them a couple of weeks ago and where the conversation sort of ended was their expectation of cap rates versus what it is that we could -- what it is that we would need to be able to generate the kind of spreads that would allow us to do the transaction. And that's where -- that's the type of conversations we're having. And clearly, if you look at what we did last year, more than five transactions were above $500 million in size, two of which were above $1 billion in size. That's what we can deliver. That's what we can bring to the table. And that's what our clients need are big solutions to big problems. And so yes, when the spigots open and this reservation price is going to be met by our cost of capital, we will be able to take advantage of and build out our pipeline just like we did the last three years.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP.
Nate Crossett: Just one on the pipeline ex development. I'm just curious if you've closed on anything so far in Q1? And if so, what was the pricing on that? And then my second question is the occupancy guide was a bit below current levels. So maybe you can just give us a little color on that? And what's on the watch list right now that we should be tracking?
Sumit Roy: Hi, Nate. So I'm not going to start giving you cap rates on assets that we have closed in the first quarter. Suffice it to say that there have been transactions that we have closed on in the first quarter. It is reflective of some of the comments that we've made. There has been movement in cap rates. You'll see that when we report our first quarter numbers, but the movement in cap rates is not as widespread as we would like to see. It's not reflective of the changes that have occurred in the cost of capital side. So -- but yes, our flow business is ongoing. And we are being a lot more selective about making sure that our spreads are not being compromised just to create volume. And we have the advantage of coming into this year with a business plan that allows us to do that. With regards to occupancy, we have mentioned that it's going to be above 98%. A lot of these were expected, at lease expiration, these were expected vacancies. And we have -- we generally tend to sort of guide to this low 98% occupancy. Part of what makes our business slightly different from perhaps what you see with the other -- with some of our other peers is we actually like to hold on to some of our vacant assets given the ability to reposition these assets and create more economic value. I know that for a long time over the last six quarters, we were hovering around that 99%, which was unusual for us. But we are very comfortable if we believe that we can generate more economic value which supersedes the holding cost of some of these vacant assets by repositioning it, et cetera, we are very comfortable doing so. So the way to think about how we run our business is the normalized level of occupancy should be in this 98.5% ZIP code. This 1.5% is vacancy that we need to be able to execute on the plans that I’ve just laid out.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern: Sumit, can you talk about the relative attractiveness of Europe right now versus the U.S.? It seems like you don't think anything is all that attractive overall, but at least in Europe, you have the better cost of debt?
Sumit Roy: Yes, that's a great question, Brad. I will tell you that even in Europe, the volume of transactions is a lot lower, again, because of this disconnect between buyers and sellers and what each requires to perpetuate a transaction. However, having said that, we are seeing pockets of opportunities, especially in the UK, where we feel like even in this environment, transactions can get done. And so that, along with the fact that at least in Europe, our cost of debt is significantly lower by 110, 120 basis points. We are continuing to look for opportunities. But the volume being low is not just unique to the U.S. It is across the geographies that we play in.
Brad Heffern: And then, Jonathan, I thought there might be more of a reduction in G&A as a percent of revenue this year than what the guidance suggested just given the additional revenue from Spirit was coming with not much additional G&A. So is there anything else going on that's keeping that figure from declining more?
Jonathan Pong: Brad, there’s always going to be a fair amount of conservatism sitting here in mid-February on line items like that. We did have quite a bit of growth from a resource standpoint in the back half of 2023, you’re going to see the full annualized effect of that. And it’s still too early to tell on the synergies front with Spirit, what ultimately is going to be achievable, but in the first month or so less than that of ownership, everything is trending to better than we expected from a synergy standpoint. And as a reminder, on a cash basis, we expected $30 million of synergies off of a $40 million cash G&A load annualized. So we’re hopeful, but look, we’re trying to create a platform. We’re trying to refine certain areas of the business, but we’re really trying to resource with everything going on, all of our groups to create this moat, if you will, that can persist for a long time. So with that comes a little bit of investment in things like technology and in people. So that’s really the driver of that.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: Good morning out there. I guess my first question is on the investment spreads here. I think you guys previously outlined expectations for a minimum of 200 basis point spread on new investments versus your cost of capital, which is well above, I guess, what you saw last year. So I guess I'm curious, one is the 200 basis points still kind of your minimum required spread? And if so, how do you achieve that today given where your cost of capital is -- appears to be somewhere in the 6s.? And if that requires using some of your free cash flow, how are you thinking about the required return for that portion of your capital as well?
Sumit Roy: Haendel, thank you for your question. So a couple of points. I've heard a few comments around free cash flow. We are going to generate north of $800 million in free cash flow. If you think about our $2 billion of acquisition guidance, this represents 40% of the total volume. And on a leverage-neutral basis, this represents 60% of the total capital. So to be able to generate 200 basis points on free cash flow is actually you can do deals at 2% cap rates and still generate 200 basis points. But obviously, that's not how we think about our business. And by the way, the 200 basis points that we were able to achieve, I would say now about 3 years ago, 2.5 years ago, that was in an environment where our cost of capital was massively different than what it is today. And being able to generate 200 basis points was not that difficult. On average, from the time we've been tracking spreads, we have always said that the average spread has been 150 basis points. We also want to make it clear that there will be times like last year and the fourth quarter of last year and all of last year where we did 120 basis points, where when you build up a pipeline with a certain backdrop with regards to your cost of capital and the cap rates that you're entering into a contract in. And by the time you close, if your cost of capital environment changes and you're permanently financing it at that point in time, that's precisely what happened all of last year. We had a very robust pipeline and we were entering into contracts with the expectation of not necessarily 200 basis points, but certainly 150 basis points and sometimes well north of that. But by the time we actually permanently finance the transaction, the cost of capital environment was different. And just to make another point, if you actually look at the cost of permanent financing that we ultimately effectuated in 2023, what we locked in, in terms of spread was closer to 140 basis points. It was 136 basis points, I think. So much closer to the average that we have since we've been tracking this particular metric. But I just want to make sure that if the expectation is that in any transaction that we enter into, we're going to try to lock in 200 basis points. That's not how we think about pursuing transactions. We also use a bar build strategy where there might be transactions that are precisely the right investment for us. And if it only creates 100 basis points, we believe that on a risk-adjusted return basis, that is the right profile for that investment, we are comfortable doing that particular investment. But then we will always try to balance it with transactions that have a 200 basis point profile. But that volatility or that spectrum of spreads in this volatile environment is very difficult to predict, which is why we are -- we've come out with the plan that we have, which -- even in this environment, we can still deliver north of 10% without having to rely on the acquisition market.
Haendel St. Juste: I appreciate that. I just want to be clear, it sounds like 200 basis points is not the absolute minimum that you're seeking, which I think is a little different for what I think we had talked about a few months ago. But my next question, I guess, is on what's embedded in the guide here regarding credit loss and the integration of the Spirit portfolio? Can you touch on that a little bit?
Sumit Roy: The integration is going very well. We've closed on the transaction on the 23. We are still very excited about the portfolio we've absorbed. As part of this transaction, we've hired eight people from Spirit on a permanent basis. And we have seven people on a temporary basis that are helping us through the integration process over the next six to nine months. In terms of the actual portfolio itself, we have not been surprised by -- now that we control this asset and the portfolio of clients that we are exposed to, we have not been negatively surprised on any front. There have been some positive surprises in terms of resolutions to certain clients where the outcome has been slightly more positive. But I will caution and say that it is still too early to tell. And that is part of the reason why we were very conservative in our underwriting. And what we shared with the market, we felt very comfortable in terms of delivering. But we've also said that it was conservative, and there happens to be upside, which we hope plays out. And if that's the case, we will share that information with you down the road.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. But are you able to quantify within the guide for potential credit loss or any added color on that?
Sumit Roy: What we can share with you, Haendel, is the range that we have shared with you accommodates for any level of credit loss that the Spirit portfolio and/or our portfolio would generate.
Operator: And our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors.
Spenser Allaway: Given the dearth of deal volume right now, especially compared to recent years, what is the highest and best use of time right now? So I know you have a massive portfolio but outside of routine asset management, I'm just curious at this quiet period, if you will, is a good opportunity to underwrite new geographies or property types?
Sumit Roy: It's all of those things, Spenser. I mean -- I think you've been following us for a while. We are constantly looking for ways to grow our portfolio and we are constantly looking at non-traditional ways to growing our earnings. And that will continue to be a massive focus of ours in 2024. You're absolutely right, part of having to absorb an additional 2,000 assets with 400 new clients, not all new clients, but 400 clients coming from Spirit. There's going to be a fair amount of asset and capital recycling that we would like to also engage in and that is something that the team is very much focused on, trying to take advantage of the time that we have to focus on playing a little bit of defense rather than the offense. But having said all of that, I do believe that this acquisitions environment can change and can change very quickly. And so the rest of the team, the investment team continues to stay in front of the clients, continues to have conversations, continues to be creative about how we could potentially be a solution to our clients. And so despite the guidance of $2 billion, I can tell you there is going to be a lot of work, perhaps even more so this year than last year in terms of creating the right tools, creating the right efficiencies, all of the things that we've sort of had to put a little bit on the back burner given the robustness of the investment environment that we've had over the last three years. So I think all of that will manifest itself in a much more scalable business, and we'll be happy to share some of that as and when we put it to use and actually start to realize some of the scale benefits.
Spenser Allaway: Okay. Great. And do you guys have a target date for when you'd like to get through the kind of the Spirit portfolio in terms of pegging some potential disposition candidates and things of that nature? Do you guys have a target date when you want to get to the portfolio?
Sumit Roy: We are not waiting on a particular date. There’s obviously a priority of assets that we have identified that we don’t believe to be core to our overall portfolio. Those are already in the market. And then we are culling through the rest of the portfolio to continue to add to our capital recycling program for 2024. So there isn’t a particular target date, but we’ll be happy to share with you more on this front during the first quarter earnings when we’ll have assumed control of this portfolio for about 2 months and 10 days.
Operator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi.
Smedes Rose: I wanted to go back to something you mentioned in your opening remarks where you were talking about being able to put in more growth opportunities into your leases? I think you mentioned it's up 50 basis points versus five years ago. And as you speak to, I guess my question is, I'm wondering, does the quality or sort of the credit quality of the client vary by the ability to push through higher escalators? It sort of feels like the higher quality or higher credit would have more bargaining power on their side to resist those kinds of changes. But I'd just be interested in kind of if you could just maybe talk about that a little more.
Sumit Roy: Sure. Smedes, your intuition is accurate. In the retail space here in the U.S., when you start to talk to investment-grade clients on the retail side, on retail boxes, that enter into long-term leases, et cetera, it is very difficult to get them to give you what one would consider to be market growth rates. And so it's the ones that tend to be BBB, BBB minus and sub-investment grade. Those are the clients that you can help drive internal growth. But let me be very clear that the 50 basis points of increase was not by going lower in the credit cycle on the retail side, but was expanding into other asset types which have a different growth profile than what retail assets do. So what were some of the steps that we took? We obviously went into industrial in a big way. Industrials tend to have, even with investment-grade clients. And at one point, I think virtually all of our clients were investment grade on the industrial side. That's no longer the case as we've matured as a company. But they too tended to give 2%, 2.5% growth. So that was one of the drivers of the change in the growth profile. The second was going into new asset types like data centers, like gaming. Those do also tend to have higher internal growth profile. And the biggest driver of all of this is really the international business where we do find a lot of growth even on the retail side with investment-grade clients. So you might recall that we had -- our first transaction was a $0.5 billion sale leaseback with one of the largest grocers in the UK, and that had a growth profile that far superseded the profile that one can get here in the U.S. So it's a combination of all of these factors, different asset types, international, which has allowed us to grow our internal growth from approximately 1% to approximately 1.5%, and that will continue to be a major focus of our business is to how do we take this profile and grow it by another 50 basis points, perhaps more so that this reliance on external acquisitions continues to be minimized.
Smedes Rose: Okay. That's super helpful. And then I just wanted to quickly ask you. I think you kind of touched on this, but you said you're going to recycle capital, more than $160 million that you did in 2023. And that's just because you probably have sort of more non-core assets identified with the Spirit acquisition. So that would -- that's what's sort of taking that number up maybe relative to where it's been historically here?
Sumit Roy: Yes. I think one of our comments was that you should expect to see a higher number than the $116 million that we accomplished in 2023. As to the actual number, we will be in a position to share that with you during our first quarter earnings call in May.
Operator: And our next question comes from Eric Borden with BMO Capital Markets.
Eric Borden: I'm just curious if you could talk about the potential opportunities you're seeing today as it relates to the credit lending platform. And what are the different types of tenant credit in industries that you're targeting today?
Sumit Roy: So Eric, the way we think about the credit business is how can we be a one-stop shop for our clients. Clients with whom we've done traditional sale-leaseback business, that have a need to continue to grow their real estate portfolio. And if there is a disconnect, which we kind of saw last year where what you could get in terms of a sale leaseback in terms of yields versus playing in a much more secured position on a balance sheet and yet get 300, maybe even more basis points of yield on investments, it's a win-win for us as well as for our clients. And they would much rather do business with somebody that they understand and that they have a relationship with, and we can offer more of these products to them and enhance the economics on our transactions. That's really what's going to drive the credit side of our business. Having said that, it's across the board. I think we've talked about doing a credit investment in the gaming side with Blackstone. We've talked about doing an investment on one of the largest grocers in the UK. Again, these are the types of examples that you should continue to see. But we are going to be very selective in terms of who we lend to, given that, that is not a core element of our business.
Eric Borden: That's helpful. And then I just wanted to ask one question on the free cash flow. On the $800 million plus of expected free cash flow for 2024, does that guidance include the potential income generated from holding cash in a money market account?
Jonathan Pong: Eric, it includes everything. So in our AFFO guidance, first of all, all of those outcomes, if we're sitting on cash like we have been, where we're relentless and trying to get as much as we possibly can while it’s there. That flows through to FFO. And then you have to deduct obviously, for the dividend, that in effect is the free cash flow.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.
Linda Tsai: Can you just take us through some puts and takes regarding the high and low end of your AFFO per share guidance?
Jonathan Pong: Linda, so on the low end at 413, it's a fairly draconian scenario. You almost have to believe that short-term rates are going to continue to push higher, which we have -- we don't have a crystal ball, but crazy things have happened. It also assumes that there's essentially a shutdown of acquisitions and so you can assume that the $2 billion is something significantly less than that. From the credit loss perspective, I think that's also something that we put in a very, very conservative number that we don't think is likely at all of happening, but it is something that is included from a bad debt perspective. There's also some certain cost elements, things like leasing commissions, things like property expenses that are not reimbursed in G&A. You always want to plan for some negative surprises there. And then in terms of the high end, it contemplates a scenario where the macro environment and the cost of capital environment improves, and we are able to do quite a bit more in terms of investment volume. It also suggests that spreads stay in that 150 and up range. Bad debt expense is something that is closer aligned to where we historically have been as a company, which has been close to 40 basis points of rent when you include the pandemic. Outside of the pandemic, we're probably closer to 25 basis points. And it probably would assume a better outcome for some identified credits that we have in the combined portfolio that naturally, we took a very, very draconian stance on as we're building up the base case for guidance. And it also assumes that the mix of our short-term rates, whether it's in euro commercial paper, whether it's in sterling denominated revolver borrowings or whether it's in USCP, which tends to comprise of every exposure, it assumes that the mix is tilted maybe a little bit more towards the European side. Right now, indicative ECP rates would be in the low 4% range. U.S. indicative rates would be in the mid-5s and then you have sterling at 6%, not on the CP side, but on the revolver side. So these are all the variables that have to hit on the low and high end in order for us to reach those scenarios.
Linda Tsai: Really helpful. And then just my second question is in your pipeline right now, what percentage is domestic versus international?
Sumit Roy: Well, we don't have -- it's unidentified on the non-development side, which was $1.2 billion. Some of it is identified, but a lot of it is discussions that we’re having both here in the U.S. and in the international markets. And if you look at what we did last year, 35% of everything we did was in the international market, 65% was here locally. That could change because it is such a small number. Based on the discussions today, there could be a lot more on the international side than here, but it’s too early to tell, Linda. If you look at the history, it’s largely been in that 30% to 40% international and 70% to 60%, 60% to 70% U.S. And that’s what we would expect under normalized situation.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alec Feygin with Baird.
Alec Feygin: So I have one on income taxes. So for the full year, the year-over-year increase in 2023 was about 15%. And the midpoint of guidance is implying about a 35% year-over-year increase in 2024. Can you provide some more color on what is driving that large increase in income taxes?
Jonathan Pong: Alec, this is really a function of the international business. So the way that we're taxed on that income, it's primarily in the UK. First of all, as a U.S. domiciled company as the 100% owner of the UK, but we are subject to some withholding taxes there. Now what we've done to combat that is we have intercompany loan interest expense and other ways that we can lower taxable income, where the effective tax rate on that NOI is around 11%. But the growth that you see year-over-year is really just a function of the growing platform and portfolio that we have abroad, which is now north of $9 billion. So it shouldn't be a surprise that as the UK grows in particular, you see that line item for income tax start to increase year-over-year. It's something that we obviously take into account in our underwriting and investment committee. It's a factor, obviously, in our long-term IRR underwriting, which is really what dictates the investment decision in most cases. And so it's a known cost that is fully built in to this business model.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming investor conferences in the Spain. Thanks. Bye.
Operator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-07 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tyler Grant, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Tyler Grant: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income’s third quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company’s Form 10-Q. We’ll be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Tyler, and welcome, everyone. We are proud of the solid execution we've delivered on our strategy in the third quarter and maintain a favorable outlook for our business. Our One Team at Realty Income continues to work diligently toward delivering strong results to our clients and stakeholders. The resilience, tenacity and range of our One Team has been impressive, culminating in the signing of the merger agreement with Spirit Realty, which we announced last week. This followed a quarter in which we invested $2 billion in high-quality acquisitions, raised over $2 billion in long-term and permanent capital, re-leased 284 properties at a 106.9% recapture rate, supporting an increase to our 2023 AFFO per share guidance range, which now stands at $3.98 to $4.01. I would like to thank our One Team for their leadership efforts and dedication on behalf of all of whom we serve. Our third quarter results demonstrate the consistency of our earnings profile through varying economic environments and the attractive internal growth of our high-quality real estate portfolio, while highlighting the capabilities of our One Team and platform. Notwithstanding the challenging capital markets backdrop, AFFO per share grew 4.1% from last year to $1.02 per share. Combined with our dividend, we are pleased to have delivered an annualized total operational return up approximately 9%. As announced last week, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Spirit Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $9.3 billion. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share on a leverage-neutral basis without requiring any external capital to fund the merger. The accretion from the transaction once completed creates the foundation for AFFO per share growth in the coming year and puts us in a unique situation where we've had good visibility to an attractive forward earnings growth rate potential two months prior to the start of the new year. Given that that of course remains a fair amount of uncertainty in the capital markets environment, the accretion from the Spirit transaction is made more compelling given the lack of capital markets risk we are absorbing to effectuate this outcome. In fact, we believe our conservative underwriting of the portfolio provides for meaningful upside potential to our headline accretion expectations. We believe Spirit's portfolio is complementary to ours and we help to further diversify our industry, client and property concentrations. We expect our increased size diversification, trading liquidity and overall presence in the market will enable us to access the capital markets even more efficiently, while also improving our ability to digest larger deals without creating concentration issues within our portfolio. We are excited about the attractive cost basis, earnings accretion and enhanced ability to buy in bulk that will be effectuated through this transaction. I would like to express great appreciation for the Spirit and Realty Income teams, given their hard work and collaboration, which enabled us to successfully progress the transaction. In the third quarter, we invested approximately $2 billion in high-quality real estate investments, leased to a diversified group of clients at a 6.9% initial cash yield. $1.4 billion of this total was derived from the international business at a 6.9% yield. Investments in the quarter were made across 132 discrete transactions. I would highlight that our volume include 34 sale-leaseback transactions for $1.3 billion of volume and six deals that were greater than $50 million in size. This demonstrates that both the corporate sale leaseback and larger transaction initiatives remained advantageous for us during the quarter. A testament to our ability to source, negotiate and close on transactions that are less trafficked amongst other net lease companies both public and private. Our investment activity year-to-date is $6.8 billion, with investments in international markets representing approximately one-third of this total. Investment spreads realized during the quarter were over 100 basis points when calculating our WACC on a leverage-neutral basis and using the cost of equity and debt actually executed during the quarter. This is a decline of 30 basis points from last quarter, which is a result of the significant increase in the cost of capital – felt across the capital markets in a short amount of time. To put it into context, the average 10-year yield increased by approximately 55 basis points from Q2 to Q3. Following the sharp changes in the public debt and equity markets during the quarter, the private market cap rates have not adequately adjusted. Accordingly, we believe that it is particularly important to be disciplined and patient allocators of capital and ensuring that we are appropriately compensated for the capital we provide. We are confident in our ability to source and allocate capital and scale and with efficiency and we are deeply focused on delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders. Given the level of transactions completed in the first three quarters of the year, combined with an outlook for narrowed investment spreads, we are modestly increasing our investment guidance to approximately $9 billion for 2023, which excludes the Spirit transaction that is anticipated to close in 2024. This increased target reflects deals that we already had in the closing pipeline prior to the recent surge in our cost of capital. With the sharp recent changes in cost of capital, we remain highly selective in pursuing new investment opportunities and will assertively hold the line on entering into any new transactions unless we can be assured of generating ample spreads to our cost of capital. From an operating perspective, our portfolio continues to be healthy and performed well. At the end of the quarter occupancy was 98.8%. This is down slightly from last quarter's historically high occupancy level of 99% and it is a result of expected client move-outs. Rent recapture rates across 284 new and renewed leases was 106.9%. This outcome is better than our historical average of 102.3% and results in year-to-date rent recapture of 104.3% on 661 new and renewed leases. I would highlight that since 1996 we have managed over 5,300 lease expirations. And the improving recapture rates in recent years is a testament to our asset management expertise and the unparalleled historical data we have at our disposal. This competitive advantage enhances the quality of our asset management decisions through unique insights gleaned from our proprietary data analytics platform. Our credit watchlist represents 2.5% of our annualized base rent as of the end of the quarter. This is a decline of 120 basis points from the second quarter and is primarily the result of removing Cineworld from the watch list following our amendment, which became effective on October 1. We recovered 60% of prior base rent on our 41 locations without any capital contributions. Importantly we also negotiated the ability to recover rent through percentage rent agreements which could give us the ability to recapture a total of 70% of prior rent based on our internal estimates of performance. Finally with the reinvestment of certain asset sales we expect to recapture a total of approximately 85% of prior rent. Same-store rent grew at an elevated rate of 2.2%. We continue to generate increasing higher average rent escalators within the portfolio due to our commitment to investing in leases with stronger rent escalators, particularly, in international markets where we have a relatively outsized number of leases with uncapped inflation escalators. The better-than-expected same-store rent growth in the quarter has enabled us to raise our full year guidance to approximately 1.5%. With that I would like to turn the call over to Jonathan.
Jonathan Pong: Thank you, Sumit. Discipline and a commitment to our A3/A minus- credit ratings continue to be our priorities from a balance sheet management perspective. During the third quarter our net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA and fixed charge coverage ratios each fell by 10% to 5.2 times and 4.5 times, respectively. In the third quarter we issued $886 million of equity primarily through our ATM program while ending the quarter with $749 million of unsettled forward equity outstanding. Combined with cash on hand with $344 million, the net availability on our credit facility of $3.4 billion we ended the quarter with $4.5 billion of liquidity. As we look forward to future capital raising needs we continue to have rate protection on $1 billion of notional value to hedge against a rising 10-year yield. We purchased this protection in the form of a derivative instrument called a swaption corridor, which effectively limits our rate exposure on a future note issuance at an option premium below the cost of a regular way vanilla option. We purchased this option in late March when a 10-year yield was in the 3.5% area. And as of quarter end the net value of the swaptions had a mark-to-market value of approximately $25 million. As Sumit mentioned previously, the Spirit transaction provides us with the opportunity for meaningful earnings accretion in the coming years. From a balance sheet perspective, the Spirit team has done a great job in curating a well-laddered debt maturity schedule, which limits our future refinancing risk in any given year. As we have experienced throughout the company's history, the global rate environment provides both headwinds and tailwinds in any given year, which is why the assumption of balance fixed rate debt stack that is spread fairly ratably from 2025 through 2032 and provides us with extended financial benefits with manageable refinancing risk. When giving effect to the combined debt maturity stack, we estimate that there will not be a year when more than 12% of our total fixed rate debt comes due. Similar to the complementary real estate portfolio, Spirits debt stack is also a good fit with our existing maturity schedule, and we expect the continued debt stack or the combined debt stack to remain well laddered giving us numerous opportunities to engage in opportunistic liability management exercises when -- and economically advantageous to do so. When I finally I would like to thank all of our team members who have worked so incredibly hard in helping to support this transaction, and we will continue to be integral as we move towards close and integration. With that, I would like to turn it back to Sumit.
Sumit Roy : Thank you, Jonathan. In conclusion as further demonstrated in the quarter, Realty Income has a well-established growth-focused business model that provides stable and predictable cash flows to fund the payout of our monthly dividend. We believe the platform we have created, evolved and refined is not easily replicable. We have a long history of prudently allocating capital that is complemented by our industry-leading capital leasing abilities that we used to invest across properties that fall within our well-defined investment criteria. The results of our efforts have produced our net lease portfolio that consists of more than 13,200 properties diversified across property types industries, geographies and clients. We're excited for the future of our business. Our anticipated acquisition of Spirit provides a solid building block for growth, as we head into 2024 and our existing portfolio continues to perform well. As such we find ourselves in a favorable position to produce high single or low double-digit operational returns, while offering the same stability that has defined this platform for decades. At this time we can open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. Maybe just going back to some of the opening remarks on the re-leasing the spreads. Just curious what drove that historically better than or the re-leasing spread is better than the historical run rate? And then just how should we think about that going forward?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. Great question, Josh. A lot of this was driven by our non-retail re-leasings. And you can see the breakout I think we provide that in the supplemental, it was closer to 140% in terms of re-leasing spreads. It was also largely driven by this one very large industrial distribution center that we released to a new client. If you looked at just the retail side of the equation that was closer to 104% which is still slightly better than average. And I think a lot of this is really what I said in my opening remarks, the more assets we control the kind of conversations that we can enter into with our clients is a different one. One of the largest renewals was Circle K and where we looked at 100 of their assets and we're able to enter into long-term lease discussions at very favorable rates. And that is what makes this platform so unique. The fact that we do control so many assets for some of these clients, the discussion we can have where, if there is an asset that's not performing well we are more than willing to give them a rent haircut, but make that more than up across the portfolio and come up with a win-win situation for both parties. And again, it's all about size and scale, but I'd be remiss, if I don't compliment the asset management team, the predictive analytics team that continues to refine the models and give scores on each asset, which gives the asset management team the confidence to then go in and negotiate knowing that these are assets that are performing well and therefore warrant an increase. So I think it's a combination of all of those factors Joshua that we were able to realize 106.9% re-leasing spreads.
Joshua Dennerlein: Appreciate that color. Maybe just stepping back, how do you think about like your strategy? Is it something you want to lean into or you can try to get assets that get better internal growth going forward? Just curious.
Sumit Roy: Yeah. Obviously, what this is implying Josh is that, if there are assets that we believe based on some of the things that I just shared with you that we can do better than the current in-place rent. We are going to take a bit of a different stance and try to take control of those assets, especially if the existing client is looking for a rent haircut et cetera. Which obviously we may have a bit of a negative drag on occupancy levels, because we want to take control and despite our best efforts sometimes when you take control, there's a bit of a lag time between getting this new client into this building at that elevated rents. But for us, the bottom line is going to be about creating better economics on rent recapture and at a small expense on the occupancy side, if that's what's going to be needed to do that. So going forward, you will see us continue to push this strategy and continue to show to the market that we do have a differentiated asset management platform.
Joshua Dennerlein: Got it. Thanks for the time.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Josh.
Operator: The next question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP. Please go ahead.
Nate Crossett: Hey good afternoon. Maybe you could just talk about the current pipeline. What do the yields look like right now? And then also how big is the Spirit pipeline? What do those yields look like?
Sumit Roy: Yes, I'm not going to speak to Spirit because it's not a transaction that we've closed on yet. So, I'll speak very much to the pipeline that we have made. And as you can tell we obviously have a very healthy pipeline. We just increased the acquisitions to approximately $9 billion, which is an increase from where we were at the end of the third quarter. And again these are very similar to what we showed you in the third quarter. If you look at some of the largest transactions we did they were with grocery operators in the UK, it was ASDA and Morrisons, both names that we like and we're able to get these very large transactions as I believe was close to a $900 million transaction. Morrisons slightly smaller closer to $170 million sale-leaseback. Both of these were sale-leasebacks and done purely on a negotiated basis. That type of transaction is what you're going to see when we get those over the finish line in the fourth quarter. Those are the types of transactions that we have in our pipeline today. Some of the comments I've made around cap rates moving but not moving commensurate with our cost of capital movement remains true. The other piece that I will overlay is the fact that some of these transactions that we have in our pipeline were created six to nine months ago. And so people may have questions, how come you were only able to get a 6.9% cash cap rate which by the way if you look at it on a straight-line basis it's almost 8.1% and just given the inherent growth in these leases and to make it equivalent to some of the other data that is shown by some of our peers. Has the growth profile that we are targeting but potentially is not reflective? Which was obviously shown in the spreads that we were able to recapture 105 basis points, which is about 30 basis points inside of what we did in the second quarter. And that goes to the point I'm making is that cap rates though adjusting are adjusting much, much more slowly than our cost of capital. And so this is a time where going forward we are going to be hyper selective. But the makeup of the fourth quarter will be very similar. You should see a movement in cap rates in the right direction, i.e. higher cap rates and more reflective of when these transactions were essentially came on to the pipeline which started to reflect the more rapid movement in our cost of capital. So, that's what you should see. It's obviously fairly healthy. But thankfully we've raised a fair amount of capital through the ATM et cetera already.
Nate Crossett: Okay, that’s helpful. Just one on the Bellagio I just wanted to ask like what is your appetite to do investments where you don't own the asset 100%. whether it's a JV or a loan? And is there anything in the pipeline that is a JV?
Sumit Roy: Off the top of my head, outside of the Bellagio transaction, I don't believe we have a JV structure in the pipeline. Similar to the way we structured the Bellagio transaction, we do tend to have JVs with developers where they hold on to a small stake in the development while developing the assets, et cetera, but we generally tend to be the takeout on the back end. But I don't think Nate and correct me if I'm wrong, that you meant those types of JVs. You were talking about more permanent JV structures like the one that we've entered into with Bellagio. I don't believe we have one like that. There is one -- there are products out there by the way, that do lend themselves to this JV structure. There are asset classes that require a tremendous amount of capital, where we will be more than forthcoming about entering into a JV just given the sheer amount of capital required. But those are going to be very specific to a very specific asset type, and I would put casinos in that bucket and perhaps some other asset types that lends itself to this. But as of right now, we don't have other JVs that we've entered into.
Nate Crossett: Okay. So like what are the other asset types like, would data centers be on that list? I'm just curious.
Sumit Roy: Yes. Data centers is certainly an asset type that will require based on this influx of AI, et cetera. It's an asset type that will have a massive requirement in terms of capital. I could see, if we choose to go into that area, that's an area that JV-ing with an operator would make perfect sense.
Nate Crossett: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. 
Q – Haendel St. Juste: Hey, I guess it's still good morning out there to you. So Sumit, I guess first question for you is on the composition of the transaction in the third quarter. The share of Europe was historically high. The high-grade share and cap rates, seemed low. Understanding there is a little bit of a lag at least on the cap rate. But I guess, I'm curious if you can help us square some of that and maybe perhaps offer any commentary or facts and figures that would help ease any concern regarding the quality of the assets you're buying? And if we should expect Europe to continue playing a greater role near term? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Sure. So you tell me, if buying Asda and Morrisons is diluting the quality of the asset pool at realty income handle. I think we've tried to answer this question before that, we do not target investment grade. What we are looking for are assets that we believe, are priced and have a profile of generating a return that is on a risk-adjusted basis, the right return profile. That is how we think about the world. And the fact that, we are able to enter into these negotiated transactions, with some of the best operators in UK. I think is something we are very comfortable doing. And the fact that they don't have a an investment-grade rating is not an issue for us given how we were able to price it, the fact that these are top quartile assets that we were able to get and have inherent growth profiles that will continue to pay dividend in years to come. So for us, it's looking at the entire investment in totality. To determine how much risk are we really taking on? What is the operator? Where are they in terms of positioning? How are they positioned within that particular sector? What is the actual real estate that we are getting? What is the performance of the four wall? I think those are the things that we focus on. And the fact that they turn out to be investment grade or not, is almost a byproduct of that analysis rather than something that we target. And I think I've said this before but thank you for asking the question. I'll keep repeating this. I believe we had about 20% of our investments this quarter that was investment grade. But again that could be in some quarters 40%, in some quarters it could even be less than that. And we will, of course, continue to share that information with you but a portfolio that on a straight-line basis generates north of 8% yield, I think is something that we are very proud of Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Certainly appreciate that. And maybe one follow-up perhaps for Jon, a question on the reserves. I think there's been about $11 million of reserve reversal year-to-date. Can you clarify what's assumed in the 4Q guide, which includes the Cineworld restructuring and if we should expect any reversals in 2024? Thanks.
Jonathan Pong: No, nothing that you should expect for the fourth quarter, pretty much all of the reserve reversals that were significant have been taken as of the third quarter. You may have seen in our same-store rent growth slide in the supplement that we saw a bit of a bump in health and fitness and that was really related to one more regional client that we reserved or refers to reserve off of. As we look forward into 2024, nothing lumpy from that standpoint that would be on the radar as we think about just bad debt expense in general, modeling out the following year we always have some semblance of an unidentified reserve that we put in there just given our history. And we're obviously very conservative on that front. And I think we've said this before, but we've historically realized about a 25 basis point credit loss in the portfolio at any given year.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Assuming you used the term hyper selective in terms of how you're going to approach the next year, can you define what hyper selective means? And does that mean that you would only look at for opportunities greater than the 100 basis point of investment trends that you saw this quarter? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: That's a great question, Michael. Look, I think if you look at where we are today and you look a year ahead in 2024, we believe that without having to rely on the equity capital markets, we'll be able to deliver approximately 4% to 5% AFFO per share growth. And that is a pretty powerful statement to make and that obviously assumes that the Spirit transaction closes either in the first month, either in January or in February. And with just the free cash flow that we are going to generate pro forma, which is going to be right around $800 million, some of the headwinds that we are going to experience in the refinancing, absorbing all of that to be able to sit here today and say that we could deliver that growth without having to raise $1 of equity. I think it's a very good place to be. And so when I said about being hyper selective, what has happened more recently is that the cost of capital has moved so dramatically, so quickly that the cap rates haven't had a chance to sort of adjust. And so we find ourselves in this – like I said in the second quarter, we had about 135 basis points of spread. And then in this quarter we have 105 basis points of spread. It's a tough environment to be in when we are entering into transactions six months, seven months in advance of closing a transaction and the cap rate environment – I mean the cost of capital environment changes and when you are permanently financing it, it sort of eats into what you had originally underwritten. That is what I meant when I said, we want to be hyper selective because we want to help drive the cap rates out to help accommodate for these unforeseen movements in the cost of capital. And so clearly the cap rates haven't adjusted as much and that's what I said that's what I mean when I say we want to be hyper selective. We want to wait for the cap rates to adjust to make sure that we can get the spreads that we have historically achieved. That was really the color behind that comment.
Michael Goldsmith: That's really helpful. And then as I follow up, occupancy took a slight step back but still well above your guidance range. So can you just talk about what you're seeing in the market in terms of pushing rents versus occupancy and how you use that to drive or maximize revenue overall?
Sumit Roy: Sure. That's a great follow-on question, Michael. So for us we are looking at a particular real estate through the lens of maximizing revenue. And the revenue maximization strategy by its very definition will mean that we are more than comfortable holding on to certain assets that are vacant for longer. If we have concluded that there is a use for that particular location and that it's not the very first client that comes in and gives us a rent proposal. But the kind of client that we are targeting and the client and a profile of rent that we are targeting that takes time. And so we are more than comfortable taking a little bit of a hit on the occupancy side to make sure that we get the best revenue optimization for that given location. And that's what you're going to see. That's the reason why even though we've been running the portfolio at 99% for the last three quarters, we have always maintained that our occupancy is going to be up slightly above 98%. Because that we believe is a natural state of occupancy for the business model that we are trying to run here. And look, where it makes sense, we will continue to sell assets vacant, if we believe that that is the most economically desirable outcome that holding on to those assets does have a cost and that just continues to drag into the return profile. So selling assets vacant is also a strategy that we will continue to implement. So I just don't want you to start thinking now in terms of, hey, there will be no more vacant asset sales. All of those options are available to us and we will pursue the one that generates the best revenue outcome.
Operator: The next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Hi, everybody. Sumit, the European deal volume was a record this quarter after a period of time where it seemed like the region was maybe a bit slower to reflect the new reality. I'm wondering if Europe is back to competing for capital on sort of a heads-up basis with the US or if this was just a one-off where you happen to have two large deals get over the finish line at the same time?
Sumit Roy: We've been talking about these two transactions for a while now, Brad. So, some of it's just taken a little bit longer to get this over the finish line. And some of it has been that cap rates do take a little bit longer to adjust in the international markets than they do here just because of the depth of the market here. You should continue to see a fair amount of product coming in from the international markets and that's reflected in our pipeline. But I always go back to when somebody asks at the beginning of the year where do you think you're going to end up? We always say that it's right around that 30% to 40% will be the international investments. And 60% to 70% will be the US And I think that is probably where we'll end up at the end of the year as well.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then can you talk broadly about the attractiveness of the different capital sources. The $750 million in unsettled equity isn't quite as much as I would have thought given you have the $3-plus billion to close by the end of the year. But I'm wondering if you're shifting to maybe a greater debt balance given where the relative costs of capital are.
Jonathan Pong: Hey Brad, it's Jonathan. So, all options are available to us. Obviously, each one of them on a nominal or absolute basis isn't where we would want it to be. But I think the one thing to consider is we're always going to prioritize that 5.5 times leverage first and foremost. And so when you look at our equity costs, you compare it to our indicative cost of 10-year unsecured debt across all three currencies that we can operate in. There is a difference that isn't necessarily wider than usual but there is a bit of a gap but we aren't going to sacrifice the balance sheet we are going to lever up just to eke out a couple of extra 10th of a basis point of growth for next year. So you could expect us to be very predictable from that standpoint and by predictable, it's carrying a reasonable balance on the line in our CP program having 10% or so of variable rate debt outstanding at any point in time and being very prudent with laddering out our maturities on a go-forward basis.
Brad Heffern: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please go ahead.
Eric Wolfe: Hey. Thanks. With regard to the Cineworld agreement, can you talk about whether that helped your guidance relative to what you were forecasting before and remind us how much income you booked on Cineworld prior to October 1, just so we can understand the incremental impact for next year?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. Everything that we've shared with you on Cineworld is obviously in the form of an agreement. So any impact that, it's going to have is reflected in the comments that we've made about next year and the fourth quarter of this year. Eric, I don't know if you're looking for anything more that we are not expecting to give you a surprise that because of the Cineworld transaction there's going to be a drag on anything that we've shared with you. That's already been absorbed and shared. It's reflected in the updated guidance that we have for 2023 and in the comments that I've made about what we expect to see happen in 2024.
Eric Wolfe : And then in the second quarter so I guess not the third quarter but the second quarter you saw around $0.5 billion increase in financing receivables within other assets. Is that more a reflection of the type of deals that were done in that quarter or rents were on those deals relative to the market? Just wondering whether we should expect a similar jump in the third quarter and sort of the quarters going forward?
Jonathan Pong: Hi, Eric. That's really driven by the accounting guidance where when you have sale-leaseback transactions and you look at the rent relative to market, the classification of that revenue goes into a different bucket it goes into other revenues and also the corresponding balance sheet impact also will show up there. So it's no different than any other regular way transaction we do it's just given the nature of it being a sale-leaseback deal with the purchase price accounting that's dictating some of the valuation associated, with the real estate versus the cash flow and that's why you see that as that bump.
Eric Wolfe: Okay. Right. So any type of sale leaseback would create sort of more outsized impact on financing receivables versus another type of deal. I'm just understanding that correctly?
Jonathan Pong: Yes.
Eric Wolfe: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Wes Golladaywith Baird. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hey, everyone. I'm just curious what are the clients saying right now? I assume, you're still the cheapest form of capital for them. Are they just looking to pause and to see where rates settle?
Sumit Roy: Yes, this is an ongoing debate. The clients tend to think about the world 12 months ago and we are trying to get them to understand the world has changed dramatically. It is that stickiness that causes the cap rate movements to drag and that's no different today. What we are seeing, however is that, when there is pressure on the client i.e. there's a maturity that they have to deal with on the debt side or they have a pipeline that is helping drive their growth and they have to build out assets or operate assets. That's where we see a willingness to transact and accommodate the new cost of capital environment. But it depends on the client it depends on the sophistication of the client it depends on the need and the urgency that the client is experiencing at that point in time where these conversations are either fairly straightforward and easy or there's a bit of a delta between what they're expecting and hoping versus what we can deliver.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks for the time.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: The next question comes from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ron Kamdem: Hey, the first couple of quick ones. Just back on tenant health, I'm looking at the supplement in this I see rent coverage is 2.8. Just wondering, does the Cineworld transaction sort of -- is that going to hit that number next quarter? Number one. And then if you could just broadly talk about just what are you seeing in terms of tenant health in sort of sectors or areas where you're starting to see some softness or any areas that are outperforming? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Ron, so the Cineworld will not have an impact on the four-wall coverage, because we don't get store-specific on a quarter-by-quarter basis. That number that we share with you our own assets where we do have a fair amount of visibility with regards to four-wall coverage. So when we have assets that have a point in time disclosure, we generally don't try to include that, so no, it won't have an impact. With regards to what we are seeing that 2.8 to 2.9 has been a fairly consistent number over the last call it three quarters. And it was a bit surprising all of last year because the cost of capital has started moving and we were expecting there to be a little bit more noise and what we ended up learning through the processes even the reserves that we had created we had to sort of unwind to reflect that the clients were doing better than what we had expected. And that theme has sort of played out. There are certainly some bankruptcies in the casual dining side, on the franchisee side that they are such a small portion of our overall portfolio. I am talking single digit basis points that they don’t have much of an impact on the overall portfolio, where by and large given the essential retail that we've targeted, those clients are doing well. Sorry?
Ron Kamdem: Sorry about that. Go ahead.
Sumit Roy: No, that was it, Ron.
Ron Kamdem: Okay. Great. So just, I guess moving on to my second question. Just want to go back to one of the comments you made about sitting here and potentially getting 4% to 5% AFFO growth per share. Just to be clear, does that include the $1.8 billion of debt coming due next year? I think at a four or in change rate being refinanced? Or how are you thinking about the interest cost headwind in that number?
Sumit Roy: Yes, it does. And I think it does. So that's definitely going to be a headwind and the way we are thinking about it is forecasting out what the forward curve looks like today, what we think we'll be able to refinance that $1.8 billion of debt and what's the negative impact running through the income statement and therefore to the AFFO per share. All of that's been taken into account. And the big caveat here is making sure that the Spirit transaction does close in January, February and that our portfolio as we've shown to you in the third quarter continues to perform the way we expected to. And just those two pieces, I do think will allow us to get to that 4% to 5% without having to really raise $1 of equity I keep going back to that because that is a very important component of 2024.
Ron Kamdem: Great. Thanks, so much.
Sumit Roy: Absolutely.
Operator: The next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai : Hi. What are your plans around assuming Spirit's term loan? And how is lender reception been?
Jonathan Pong : Hey, Linda, we fully expect to assume Spirit's term loan they've got $1.1 billion outstanding with a delayed draw to get to $1.3 billion. And so it's obviously all swapped at a very attractive fixed rates for us. We have had some preliminary discussions with the lender group. The good news is that there's quite a bit of overlap with our lenders and their lenders and we've been very flattered by the reception so far from our banking orders. And so everything is going according to plan there. We'll be able to utilize those swaps that carry quite a bit of value and it fits nicely again into our maturity schedule. So everything is going fine there.
Linda Tsai : And then in terms of the Spirit acquisition, what's the impact on Realty's credit ratings and how do fixed income investors or review [ph] view this transaction?
Jonathan Pong : Yes. So Linda was a very favorable reaction and constructive feedback from the rating agencies both Moody's and S&P they came out and reaffirmed the A3 ratings stable outlooks. And so again, we talk about how this is a very complementary portfolio and balance sheet. I would say, if you look at the before and after for some of the key credit metrics and our bond covenants, it's essentially unmoved. And so from that standpoint it was at a very lease credit neutral and some could argue you would get positive given the additional scale that provides us. And so all good on the fixed income and rating agency side.
Linda Tsai : Just one last one. How do you think about portfolio discounts broadly like the EG group deal? Do you think they'll persist in 2024 and beyond?
Sumit Roy : I do Linda. And in fact the larger the transaction, the better discount you're going to get. We genuinely at least here at Realty Income. We believe that to be one of the core differentiators of realty income and anybody else in this space the ability to do these $1 billion transaction, $2 billion transactions and not have to worry about diversification. Obviously, you know of Jonathan and his team's ability to access capital. I mean, that's a big advantage for us. And even pre-Spirit we are probably the name that trades the most on an average daily basis and that too helps on the equity side of the equation. So I think setting aside the capital and people are more and more talking about our ability to access differentiated capital, they are approaching us with solutions that they're looking for that has multiple millions of dollars associated with it and even potentially billions of dollars associated with it. And so that's how we want to be viewed. And as soon as you start to have those discussions on a one-on-one basis, you have the ability to move cap rates a little bit more. You have the ability to construct leases that are a lot more favorable. And we've seen that -- we saw that on the transactions we just announced in the third quarter with ASDA and Morrison. We saw that on EG Group in the second quarter. We saw that on the gaming asset that we did in the fourth quarter of last year. These are all these $1 billion plus or close to $1 billion transactions. And that's where I think we will continue to shine.
Linda Tsai : Thanks for the color.
Sumit Roy : Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.
Sumit Roy : Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the NAREIT conference in Los Angeles next week. Have a great afternoon. Bye-bye.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-03 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Bakke, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Steve Bakke: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income’s second quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause differences in the Company’s Form 10-Q. We’ll be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Steve. Welcome, everyone. We successfully executed on our strategy in the second quarter and continue to see momentum across the business. I would like to sincerely thank our One Team whose focus and commitment to continue to propel our business forward, serving all our clients and stakeholders. We believe the strength of our platform and quality of our real estate portfolio were evident in the quarter’s results. Despite a challenging interest rate environment, AFFO per share grew 3.1% from last year to $1 per share. Combined with our dividend, we are pleased to have delivered a total operational return of over 8% on a trailing 12-month basis. Delivering stable and consistent growth is foundational to our mission at Realty Income. Underlying this growth, our team continues to source and invest in high-quality properties at accretive spreads to our cost of capital while partnering with our clients who are leaders in nondiscretionary, low-price point and service-oriented industries. Partnering with industry leaders across over 13,000 properties in a diversified real estate portfolio offers us durability of cash flows that results in the predictable nature of our revenues, earnings and dividend payments. Our investment activities remain robust as we continue to demonstrate that size and scale are unique advantages in the sale-leaseback and portfolio transaction markets. In the second quarter, we closed on approximately $3.1 billion of high-quality real estate investments, which brings our year-to-date investment activity to over $4.7 billion. Cap rates in our acquisitions appear to have stabilized after a meaningful adjustment period to a higher interest rate environment. Though in select situations, we continue to find unique opportunities to source and close on larger transactions where our relationships, platform and access to capital allow us to take advantage of more favorable terms. Our second quarter initial cash lease yield of 6.9% represents a 120 basis-point increase compared to the second quarter of 2022 and resulted in a realized investment spread of approximately 133 basis points when calculating our WACC on a leverage-neutral basis using the cost of equity and debt raised in the quarter. In addition to closing our $1.5 billion U.S. convenience store acquisition from the EG Group, we remained active internationally during the second quarter, closing on $416 million of investments at an initial cash lease yield of 7.1%. This international activity includes the addition of a new geographic vertical in Ireland where we acquired two properties for $54 million at healthy cash yields. Given the transaction velocity we have achieved in the first half of the year, we are increasing our outlook for investments to over $7 billion for 2023. Year-to-date, we have acquired 15% of source investment volume compared to an average of 7% over the last five years. In today’s more constrained environment for capital, we have found the size and scale of our platform have become increasingly meaningful differentiators as we seek accretive growth opportunities. Shifting to operations, our portfolio continues to perform, and we ended the quarter with occupancy of 99%, the third consecutive quarter at that level. This matches our highest occupancy at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. Additionally, our rent recapture rates increased from last quarter to 103.4% across 201 new and renewed leases, bringing the year-to-date recapture rate to 102.7% across 377 new or renewed leases executed in the period. As further testament to the stability of our portfolio and the leading clients with whom we partner, our client watch list declined from last quarter and now represent less than 4% of our annualized rental revenue. This is the lowest level in the last five years. Finally, our same-store rental revenue increased 2.0% in the quarter, a tangible result of our purposeful decision to seek investment opportunities with higher internal growth characteristics as well as the benefit of uncapped CPI-based rent escalators, present in nearly 30% of the leases in our growing international portfolio. Our efforts to increasingly pursue leases with meaningful contractual rent escalators has helped contribute to a portfolio with contractual rent growth at approximately 1.5% per annum as of the second quarter, or 2% annual growth on a levered basis. Before turning it over to Christie, I would like to recognize the tremendous value she has brought to Realty Income, first as a Board member, and then as Chief Financial Officer. Her leadership and counsel through a very active period for our company has left a lasting positive mark. As well, I would also like to congratulate Jonathan on his upcoming promotion to CFO. Christie?
Christie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. It’s an honor to serve our colleagues, Board and stakeholders during this exciting time at Realty Income. As we previously announced at the end of this year, I will be retiring as CFO and passing our CFO baton to Jonathan Pong, who is our current Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. Jonathan has been with the Company for the last nine years and brings significant experience to the role, having overseen our capital markets, investor relations, FP&A and derivatives functions during his time here. Over the last 2.5 years, since joining the management team, we have worked closely together as part of a planned succession, and Jonathan is well positioned to carry the torch moving forward. With that, I would like to hand the call over to Jonathan to go over the financial results from our quarter.
Jonathan Pong: Thank you, Christie. I would be remiss without acknowledging your many contributions to the Company and its stakeholders during your tenure. I’m grateful for your guidance, support and leadership, all of which have laid the foundation for excellence as our business continues to evolve. Over my 9-year, 10-year at Realty Income, we have experienced significant growth in new industry verticals, geographies and property types. However, we’ve continued to view a reliable growing dividend and a well-capitalized balance sheet as critical components of our business. To that end, we finished the second quarter with healthy leverage as measured by net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA of 5.3 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio remains solid at 4.6 times. We are once again active issuers of equity capital via the ATM, raising approximately $2.2 billion in the aggregate in the second quarter, $651 million of unsettled forward equity remains outstanding as of today. As our platform has advanced and grown over time, our investment spread business has been supported by access to a wide range of products in the capital markets. Last month, we added another capital source to our inventory, raising €1.1 billion through our debut public offering of euro-denominated unsecured bonds. This dual tranche offering resulted in a weighted average tenure of 9 years and a weighted average annual yield to maturity of 5.08%. Establishing a presence in the euro unsecured bond market allowed us to diversify our fixed income investor base, and generate a natural hedge for yield denominated earnings and access of source of debt capital that was priced approximately 60 basis points inside of indicative U.S. dollar bond pricing at the time of execution. Proceeds from the offering effectively repaid short-term borrowings on a multicurrency revolver and commercial paper programs, which had a combined balance of $990 million at quarter end. Combined with $254 million of cash on hand at quarter end and the $650 million of forward equity previously mentioned, we believe we are well capitalized with significant liquidity heading into the third quarter. Finally, from an earnings outlook perspective, the midpoint of our 2023 AFFO per share guidance is unchanged, though we are narrowing the guidance range of $3.96 to $4.01, representing approximately 1.8% growth at the midpoint. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Jonathan. As our second quarter results illustrate, our company is well positioned to provide consistent results in a variety of economic environments and to grow through a variety of different acquisition channels. The optionality we have to toggle between different sources of capital is also a competitive advantage as it broadens our reach of investors and oftentimes provides a lower cost of capital alternative to the public U.S. dollar market. Looking at the S&P 500 constituents within our addressable market, we count approximately 300 firms with $1.6 trillion of owned real estate. To quantify the near-term opportunity, which is available to us as sale-leaseback capital providers, this group has approximately $1.2 trillion of debt representing 34% of the group’s outstanding debt capital maturing between 2024 and 2027. Meanwhile, corporate bond deals have risen anywhere between 240 and 400 basis points from the 2021 average to today. This compares to a 140 basis-point increase in initial cash lease yields for Realty Income’s investments over the same time frame, making our capital solutions even more competitively priced on a relative basis than in the past. Because of this cost of capital convergence and because of the many benefits sale-leaseback financing provides, including the elimination of maturity risk, we believe there is a more compelling case to be made than ever for corporates to look to sale-leaseback financing to replace maturing debt. As the attractiveness of sale-leaseback financing accelerates for corporates with looming debt maturities and elevated debt costs, we believe our growth opportunities will continue to expand on a sustainable basis. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Nate Crossett of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.
Nate Crossett: Maybe just a question on guidance. Maybe you could just unpack, you guys increased acquisition and volume guidance but the midpoint on AFFO remained the same. Maybe you can just kind of go over the puts and takes there. And then also, what are you guys assuming for kind of cap rates in your guidance, I think were down 10 basis points in the quarter. What’s kind of the outlook of the pipeline right now?
Sumit Roy: So Nate, I’ll take your second question first, and then I’ll hand it off to Jonathan to talk about puts and takes with regards to the earnings guidance. With regards to the cap rate, we are assuming the cap rate to be within the ZIP code that we’ve announced in the second quarter and in the first quarter. That’s where we believe where the cap rates have settled down. Opportunistically, there are situations that we could enter into where we could drive those cap rates higher. But for modeling purposes, I would request that you keep it within these ZIP codes that we’ve announced in the first and second quarter. Jonathan?
Jonathan Pong: Hey Nate, on the guidance question, I would, first of all say, the midpoint of our guide is the same as the as it was at the start of the year. And so, when you think about how we put guidance together, there’s a lot of puts and takes that we look at, at the beginning of the year, revisit at every quarter. We know that on a probability-weighted basis, not all of the takes are going to happen and all the puts are going to happen. And so when you think about acquisition guidance increasing two quarters now, that was a scenario that we had expected at the start of the year, but there was always going to be puts and takes that could offset that a bit. I think the biggest one for us has been short-term interest rates. When you look at what was implied back in January and February on the SOFR forward curve, you compare that to what it is implying today, about a 40 basis-point increase. And so that alone is $0.01 per share for our business in the back half of the year. So I would say that, and there’s also some other things that we always get that maybe we’re taking a slightly more conservative view on over the second half of the year appropriately, but we feel very good about being more or less accurate from what we came out at the start of the year.
Nate Crossett: Okay. That’s helpful. Maybe just one on the debt rates are much lower in Europe. You did that recent bond deal. Can you just like talk about how much you could kind of theoretically raise over there to kind of take advantage of the better cost of capital? Are there any like hindrances like in terms of size?
Jonathan Pong: Yes, Nate. We’re not going to go crazy and have significantly more liabilities denominated in one currency relative to the assets we have denominated in that same currency, especially when it’s foreign denominated. And so for us, when we’re going out and issuing in various currencies, we’re thinking about the income statement, FX risk that we might have, and we’re using the natural interest expense in that currency to serve as a hedge. If we don’t have that, there’s not a lot of reason for us to go out and do that type of issuance. We also know that we have a very active acquisition pipeline across all currencies. We know that we’re going to need the capital at some point really denominated in dollars, sterling or euro. So, that’s how we think about it. It was a 60 basis-point pickup relative to comparable U.S. dollar, but for us, it’s really about diversification. And so, you can expect us to utilize everything in our toolkit going forward. But I think we are all set on the euro side, at least for the near term.
Operator: The next question comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank.
Greg McGinniss: So, as always, I’m interested in any larger portfolio deals. And we appreciate your opening remarks regarding the size of the potentially addressable S&P 500 market. But have you noticed any material uptick in sale-leaseback interest from those companies at this point, or is that still a developing potential?
Sumit Roy: I guess, we have to post one of these large transactions per quarter. And I think we’ve done that. If you look at what we’ve done in the fourth quarter of last year, that’s when we closed on the gaming asset, which was $1.7 billion. You look at the large portfolio deal we did in the first quarter, it was a CIM transaction. That was circa $900 million. And in the second quarter, we’ve announced the $1.5 billion and closed the $1.5 billion EG Group transaction. And look, the reason why we are sharing all of this data is to help support what we are seeing develop in our pipeline and the conversations that we are having currently. Now, how much of that gets translated to close transactions, time will tell. But clearly, we are very optimistic. And that is one of the main drivers of why we have increased our guidance by another $1 billion in terms of acquisitions. So, we just feel like -- I wish our cost of capital was slightly better. But in terms of actual transactions, we feel like the pipeline is robust and it’s largely a function of what is happening in the debt capital market.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. What are your thoughts on increasing maybe the level of tenant debt investments to push earnings growth higher and offset some of that cost of capital? It’s not exactly where you want it.
Sumit Roy: Well, we think of ourselves as an investment company. And Greg, so where we invest on the capital stack is always available for debate within the four walls of Realty Income. And wherever we feel like we can quantify the risk and underwrite the benefits of doing a sale-leaseback versus doing a direct loan to one of our clients, we are going to go down the path of whichever yields the best risk-adjusted return. So, yes, we haven’t done one of those, but it is certainly up for discussion, and it’s one that we have been discussing with my colleagues here at Realty Income.
Operator: The next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Sumit, can you give your updated thoughts on how you feel about the theater business broadly right now? Obviously, AMC recently reported its best week, but then you have the strikes, which will theoretically start affecting things at some point and the release schedule isn’t back to normal. So, are you feeling worse at this point or better given the recent strength?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So Brad, I’ve always stated this about the theater business that it is largely a function of content. And as long as the content continues to develop and it goes back to levels that it was pre-pandemic, which was circa 70, 75 big tent type releases, we’re going to get back to levels pretty close to the revenue levels that we had in 2019. And anytime you have situations like the one that you’ve just described where you have a strike, it does obviously put a little bit of a breaker in terms of the ability of studios to continue to release those big tent movies. The good news in today’s environment versus the last time there was a strike, which lasted, if I remember correctly from -- for about four months. The good news today is we’ve got a lot more studios beyond the big four that are releasing big budget movies, and I’d put Amazon and Netflix in the mix there. But yes, all else being equal, a strike is not a good thing. Do I see this having a near-term impact, I don’t think so because a lot of these movies have already been completed, and it’s just a question of staging the release. But longer term, it could have a disruption on how many of these movies get released. And so, we are watching this closely. I believe there’s a meeting on Friday, where the studios are getting together with the writers and the actors and all of that. And my hope is that there’s a resolution soon. And -- but yes, it is a situation that we are monitoring closely. But my expectation, if it is anything like what it was last time, this should resolve itself in the next couple of months.
Brad Heffern: Okay. I appreciate that. And then can you give your expectations for the Cineworld sites that were rejected and maybe talk through some of the opportunities with those, whether it’s just typical releasing or if there’s a development opportunity for any of them?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So Brad, I’m not going to give -- go into the details of the Cineworld situation, just because we haven’t quite penned the contract yet. What I will say is that any of the potential economic outcomes have been completely reflected in our updated earnings guidance. So, that’s how I’m going to leave it with the Cineworld situation. And I’ll just add something to stuff that I’ve already talked about in the past, there will be a few assets that we expect to get back. And we have already started to look at what are the alternatives at those particular sites. And the gamut runs from a complete redevelopment of the site to an alternative use, i.e., industrial to situations where we have a retailer coming in and talking about potentially just taking the asset as is, even though they’re not movie theater operators, to potentially re-entitling the asset for an alternative use and selling it, i.e., creating more value for ourselves. And the last bucket will be just selling the asset as is. So, all of those various permutations are being considered on a handful of assets that we expect will get rejected through this process. But, I’m not going to go into any more detail than that.
Operator: The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Sumit, I’d like to go back to a conversation we’ve had in the past on i-grade. You continue to source deals here with a lower share of i-grade than historically. And I know in the past, you’ve talked about that your experience in acquiring higher-yielding assets and you’re focused on generating the best risk-adjusted returns. But this quarter, particularly, we had a big drop, but it continues the trend of having below average i-grade. So I guess, is this a dynamic that we should just expect to continue going forward? Is this a new norm? How should we think about the share of i-grade going forward? Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure. Thank you for that question, Haendel. So just to continue to reiterate the point, we are not targeting investment-grade. What we are targeting are opportunities that yield the best risk-adjusted return. If it so happens that it is an investment-grade client and so be it. But ultimately, it’s the economic profile of that investment that’s going to dictate as to whether or not we are going to invest. Today, truth be told, we are looking at some of these investment-grade opportunities and cannot pencil the risk-adjusted returns. We are finding far more value in areas where we’re looking at subinvestment-grade tenants who are willing to give us a return profile that is commensurate with the inherent risk in that particular opportunity. And that’s what’s driving the approximately 26% year-to-date investment-grade closings that we’ve done and is close to 18%, I think, for the second quarter. But that’s how we think about the world. And the other thing I’d just point out is just to make it equivalent because I have seen some of these cap rates being reported and there’s a bit of a mixed match. When we’re talking about a 6.9% cash lease yield, if you layer in the straight line, we’re talking about an additional 100 basis points. And I’ve seen certain reports that are sort of conflating these two numbers. So just to make it apples-to-apples, our straight line yields are closer to 7.9% on $3.1 billion worth of acquisitions. That’s where we are seeing the value, with, I would argue, much better growth profile. And clearly, that’s represented in the 100 basis points of increase when compared to cash yields. So that’s how you should think about us Haendel. And if it just so happens that this dynamic were to shift and suddenly investment-grade was to go back to our 40%, 45% that we have in our portfolio, then that will be it. But it’s not something that we target, and you shouldn’t expect us to be targeting that number going forward.
Haendel St. Juste: That’s really helpful. I appreciate the color there. And one more. I guess, I wanted to get your updated thoughts on investing in gaming assets today. I know in the past, you’ve talked about having an interest. I’m curious if you’re seeing anything out there today that would interest you, what type of returns or incremental spreads you require there? And specifically, your potential -- or your level of interest in a potential Bellagio trade. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure. So again, I’m not going to talk about specifics, but I’ll repeat what I’ve said in the past about our desire to grow our gaming vertical. We are obviously looking at many opportunities. And thankfully, it’s a fairly robust environment today for gaming. And yes, in terms of how we’re going to view these opportunities, it’s along the lines of how I answered the previous question. So that’s what you should expect from us for this particular vertical.
Operator: The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joshua Dennerlein: I just -- I saw your cap rates on -- it looks like domestic acquisitions is about 6.8% and then, for developments, it was like a 6.9%. Some basis point spread seems kind of small. So just -- is that a function of kind of when deals were struck or just the risk profile of the tenants or just something that you’re seeing broadly in the market?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Very good question, Joshua. As you know, when you enter into transactions that have a long duration associated with it, which is what development by its very definition, is going to have. It does become a function of when were those transactions entered into and what’s the duration of that build-out period. And so, what you might have noticed is if you’re tracking our development yields over the last few quarters, you’ve noticed a marked increase in those cash yields on developments. It’s largely a function of when did we strike those. So things that you’re starting to see filter through in the second quarter, which has a similar yield to what you saw on the domestic side, it’s largely a function of us having entered into those transactions over the last two to three quarters, when we were anticipating a much higher interest rate environment and therefore, being able to work with our clients to get that yield reflected in the development cycle. And you should continue to see that. Trends slightly higher looking into the next few quarters as some of the older generation development opportunities start to sort of get fully developed and are -- become cash paying opportunities. So I think just keep a close eye on that and that’s the trend you should see manifest itself over the next few quarters.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. All right. That makes sense. And then I think Jonathan might have answered this, but I just wanted to clarify, the top end of guidance, it looks like you took down $0.02. Was it just the interest rate environment that’s pushing down -- put downward pressure on that top range or anything else in there? Just curious, given acquisition guidance a bit, so.
Jonathan Pong: Hey Josh. To address that, Sumit brought it up earlier, the impact of what we felt was the greatest uncertainty out there, the Cineworld resolution, tat impact is now that is known to us. And going into the quarter, it was something where there was a range of possibilities that we built into the high end and the low end. And so with a greater sense of confidence now where that’s trending, we felt that it was appropriate to take the high end down by $0.02 in addition to bringing the low end up by $0.02.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Jonathan, you’ve been with Realty Income for a while, and I think you’re developing a reputation for a creative solution from a financing perspective. But as you move into the CFO seat, is there anything different that -- is there anything different that you would think about doing in their new position or different approaches to what Realty is doing overall? Thanks.
Jonathan Pong: Thanks, Michael. I appreciate the question. I would say, look, what’s made Realty Income so successful over the years, regardless of what we’ve done, what verticals we’ve established, it’s commitment to a fortress balance sheet. And that’s the one thing that is going to be sacrosanct to us for as long as we’re in existence in these seats. And so, we’re not going to sacrifice things like the A3 minus credit rating that we worked very hard to get. We’re not going to sacrifice the trust of the fixed income community that now spans across three different currencies. And so, you’re going to see us continue to focus on low leverage, plenty of liquidity and we’re going to be very predictable from that standpoint. I think going forward, given the added complexity of the business, the volume, the transaction volume that we see, the different countries that we’re in, and we’ll continue to be in, I think it’s really more of a focus on more of the internal operations now. The external side of things, I think we’re pretty well established. We’re going to continue to be creative. But I think it’s about building and continuing this momentum on the internal platform that we’ve created, which we think is a differentiator in the net lease industry and frankly, in the real estate industry.
Michael Goldsmith: And Sumit, you mentioned your size and scale as a competitive advantage, at least twice, if not 3 times on the call. Do you feel like -- do you feel like your competitive advantage is growing? Are you seeing fewer bidders on some of the larger deals out there? Is that gap and the strength of the size and scale, is that improving and widening versus peers? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Thanks for the question, Michael. I might have actually said it four times. I’m not sure. I just believe in it so much. And it’s really not something that we believe. It’s what we are hearing. When we are engaging in these conversations with clients who are big clients who have big questions that they’re trying to answer, it’s the fact that who gets invited to the table. And when we see that we are the only REIT in the net lease space at the table competing against private sources of capital, that in itself gives us continued confidence that we are playing a game that is very different from some of our smaller peers. And we want to be that. We want to be the real estate partners of choice for the S&P 500 names. We want to be the first name that is considered when we -- when folks think about -- they have the ability to write big checks. They have the ability to stand by what it is they say. Their reputation speaks for itself and their ability to close is bar none. And when we hear those comments from clients who work with us and more recently with some of our new clients who’ve been added to our registry, it gives us continued confidence to say that our scale and size is being appreciated within this space.
Operator: The next question comes from Eric Wolfe of Citi. Please go ahead.
Eric Wolfe: Just wanted to follow up on Greg’s question. When you look at your S&P peers, just curious what percentage would you say are receptive to the sale-leaseback conversation? And how has that changed versus a couple of years ago? Just trying to understand how your addressable market has changed. And for those that perhaps aren’t as receptive what’s the typical pushback?
Sumit Roy: I can’t give you percentages, Eric. But what I can point to is just look at some of the larger transactions we’ve done and who have we done it with. And they’re all first time sale-leaseback candidates, right? Think about Wind. [ph] They were -- they’ve never done a sale-leaseback before, and they chose to do it with us. Think about EG Group they’ve never done a sale-leaseback before. Their best chance of doing a sale-leaseback was when they actually ended up being the winners in the Cumberland Farms portfolio. This was three, four years ago. And they chose not to do it at that time. And so part of the reason why I believe that sale-leaseback as a product is maturing, is certainly driven by the capital markets environment that we find ourselves in and suddenly finding that sale-leaseback as an alternative to raise capital is quite beneficial vis-à-vis as we were traditionally being compared to the debt capital markets, especially for names that are lower investment-grade or sub-investment-grade candidates. And so I believe that that will continue. And there will be other transactions that we hope to get over the finish line that we can speak to. That will again be first-time candidates. And yes, we feel like that that will continue to grow.
Eric Wolfe: That’s helpful. And then you look at the 10-year or whatever interest rate you want to look at and it’s up pretty meaningfully over the last couple of weeks. When you see moves like this and how quickly will you adjust your pricing on future acquisitions or potentially even re-trade some deals, just trying to understand how sort of real-time capital market volatility changes and return all those?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So Eric, I’m going to have Jonathan talk a little bit about things that we try to do to anticipate what I’ll call unanticipated movements in 10 years, okay? We talk about a hedging strategy that we have in place. But I just want to make one point very clear. Our cost of capital gets mark-to-market pretty much by the second. That’s not how cap rates move. There is absolutely a lag time, how sticky these movements, these upward movements and the cost of capital -- people have a different opinion about how sticky that is. And that drives their view around what cap rates should be. And it does take time for people to adjust to a higher cost of capital environment. And if there’s a lot of volatility that makes that adjustment period that much more difficult. So yes, we’ve seen movements on the 10-year from 3.86 to 4.17, 4.18 today within a matter of days, you’re not going to see a 30 basis-point movement in cap rates to reflect this movement in 10-years, unless we see that this 4.7 -- I mean, 4.17, God forbid, 4.7. 4.17, 4.2 become a more sustainable rate. But then what do we do balance sheet perspective to sort of anticipate those situations? I’ll have Jonathan speak to that.
Jonathan Pong: Thanks, Sumit. We’ve been very active on the hedging front, both for FX, which I alluded to earlier, but also on the interest rate front. If you look at the 10-Q from the first quarter, you’ll see that we actually purchased swaptions, which really go out until January of next year that protects us against rising rates on the tender. The reason why we chose 1 billion, the reason why we went out to January is because we do have some debt maturities coming up of around $1 billion, $1.1 billion in the first quarter of next year. We put those hedges in place in late March, early April and as far as you might imagine, it’s pretty healthily in the money right now. So from that standpoint, we’ve taken out the primary balance sheet risk -- or refi risk that we have coming up over the 6 to 9 months, but we’re always going to look for opportunities where we see a risk, we want to be proactive. We can’t time to market, but what we can do is mitigate the exposure that we have on potential risk. And so -- that’s something that we’ve done now twice, and the first time we did it was the middle of pandemic, and we were able to monetize that what swapped at a $72 million gain. We’re not always going to be so fortunate, but that’s how we’re thinking about managing risk.
Operator: The next question comes from Wes Golladay of Baird.
Wes Golladay: Can you talk about what’s going on in the UK? It looks like volume was low. I’m just curious if this is a function of just low deal volume, or is it just pricing, just lagging still over there?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Neil needs to work a little bit harder, I think. It really is a timing issue as we had some great momentum towards the end of last year driven by pressures that funds were experiencing on the redemption side and it created some amazing opportunities for us. That momentum continued into the first quarter. Second quarter was still very healthy. We did about $420 million which is a big number, but it’s just -- it got dominated by what we did on the U.S. side, largely driven by the $1.5 billion. If you take that $1.5 billion away, and you look at what we’ve done, we were at $1.6 billion, of which the European -- the international business represented, I would say, trying to do a quick math right around 30%. So -- and that’s generally been where the international business has contributed. But look, I’m very excited about that business, and there’s more to come.
Wes Golladay: Okay. It sounds good. And yes, good job, Neil. That’s actually good volume once adjusted. I guess next question is more bigger picture. I’m kind of curious what your opinion would be, what is the bigger risk to net lease? Would it be inflation and potentially having this price escalators, would it be tenant credit at this point of the cycle?
Sumit Roy: I would think it’s tenant credit. You’ll have to look at all of the various different net lease businesses and take a view on where do you see the credit risk largely driven by these inflationary pressures, the persistence of those inflationary pressures which then obviously is resulting in this higher interest rate environment. I think that’s going to sort of filter through and it will impact net lease businesses, net lease companies differently, depending on the makeup of where their exposure lies. For me, one of the advantages that we have is, do we -- can we perfectly match inflation with -- of the inherent growth rates that we have, we can’t. So there’s always going to be a bit of a mismatch. But have we, and now I’m talking about Realty Income, done a much better job of growing the inherent growth profile of our leases? The answer is a categorical yes. Today -- and I think it was part of my prepared remarks, our overall portfolio, if you were to do nothing, will grow by 1.5% and on a levered basis closer to 2%. Some of it is actually benefited from non-capped CPIs that we’ve been able to get on one-third of the assets that have CPI growth rates built into them in the international markets. And those have contributed greatly to increasing our inherent growth rate. So, it’s never going to be perfectly matched, but the risk of not having a perfectly matched growth rate inherent in your leases is somewhat muted versus credit risks that could translate into much bigger impact on your overall business.
Operator: The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Kamdem: Just two quick ones. Staying on the tenant credit risk. So, I see occupancy 99%; median EBITDA, it looks like it ticked up 2.8% versus 2.7% last quarter. And I know that’s reported with a lag, but still pretty interesting. And I think in your opening comments, you mentioned that basically the watch list was the lowest sort of ever. So things are certainly feeling pretty good. But as you sort of look forward, when you hear stuff like student loans starting again for property insurance in Florida. Just sort of curious, how does your team sort of stress test that or think about that, what the potential impact did it have on the tenant side? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Yes. Good question, Ronald. And just to clarify, it wasn’t the last five years that I said that our credit watch list is in the 3s. It’s the lowest it’s been in the last five years. Those are very good questions. what is it when student loans get instituted back again and discretionary income falls? What are the first things to go? It’s going to be discretionary spend, right? And if you look at the portfolio that we’ve created that largely consist of nondiscretionary, low-price point, service-oriented businesses, these are things that will be the last to go. Could they be impacted? Of course, they can. But when you have discretionary income that is getting compressed, those are not going to be the types of businesses that will get impacted first. And that’s how we’ve constituted our portfolio of assets is being very much focused on what are the industries that are going to be a lot more resilient under economic conditions like the one that we are facing today. So, it is not by luck that we find ourselves with a credit watch list that is circa 3.7%. It is by design. And that’s how we run our business, Ronald.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And then my second one was just -- so going back to guidance a little bit and taking a step back thinking about this year, just can you -- what are the big two or three sort of comp issues that the guidance was facing this year? I think you hit on one, which is the interest cost sort of headwind, right, for this year. But presumably, that’s not going to be an issue for ‘24 because the comp just is not as tough. But was there anything else sort of onetimey or unique to this year, it could be property tax, it could be whatever that we should be mindful of, for ‘23 that maybe does not sort of happen again in ‘24?
Jonathan Pong: Hey Ron, it’s Jonathan. I’ll say -- I’ll expand on what I said earlier regarding short-term rates. We talked about the impact to the back half of this year. But when you really zoom out and you look at year-over-year versus all of 2022 versus 2023, it’s even a greater impact. It’s closer to $0.07 or $0.08, which based off the midpoint of our guide is about 2%. And so, you take that out and on a normalized basis, the volume that we’re doing, everything that we’re doing from a portfolio and asset management standpoint, we’re trending closer to a 5% number year-over-year if you were at 3.1% this quarter. The first quarter did have a little bit of a tougher comp, if you recall the first quarter of 2022. We did have a significant reserve reversal in the other industry. So that’s why the first quarter was a little bit flat. Second quarter outside of rates is getting back more towards a normalized level. So, back half of the year, I think you’ll continue to see some difficult comps on the SOFR front. And given that we do have even an 8%, 10% exposure to variable rates, just given the magnitude of the move, that’s going to be the biggest difference.
Operator: The next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Just going back to your comment regarding the stickiness of cap rates, the investment spread of 133 basis points. How does that vary between international and domestic investments? And where would you see investment spreads in those two categories trending?
Sumit Roy: Yes. If you actually follow the headline cap rates that we are registering, I think the international business was 20 basis points higher. So, that should answer your question, Linda. But, again, this is going to be very much a product-by-product opportunity-by-opportunity discussion in terms of what is the actual spread that we are going to realize, and is there an advantage between the domestic markets and the international markets. I think the advantages are very different. Here in the U.S. market, there’s clearly more competition, there are more players. In the international markets, we don’t experience that. The U.S. market, however, is a much more mature sale-leaseback market. And so there are more opportunities that one can participate in, whereas I would say the international market is still in the nascent stages of sale-leaseback as a viable product. It is maturing, but it is behind the curve. And for us, what we want to try to do is position ourselves in both these markets and work from our points of strength that allows us to then win transactions. Our average has been 150 basis points of spread from the time we’ve been tracking spreads. And first quarter, it was 200 basis points, based on realized capital that we raised to actually help finance our business. This quarter, based on, again, the same method, it’s 133 basis points. So, if you average out year-to-date, it’s still north of what our 150 basis points historical average has been. But it’s very difficult, Linda to tell you, going forward, you’re going to have one geography that is going to dominate the spread versus another. It’s very much opportunity-driven.
Linda Tsai: Got it. And then I think you said 30% of your international leases have uncapped CPI. What is the nature of those tenants that are open to that versus the other 70% of leases that don’t have uncapped?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Linda, let me be a bit more precise. Of the international leases that have CPI as the driver of internal growth, one third or 30% of them are uncapped. So not all of our leases in the international markets have CPI drivers of internal growth. So, I just want to make that clarification. And again, it is very much a function of the market. A market that is used to seeing CPI growth as the metric for -- in their leases, they’re far more receptive to continuing to see that. Now there has been some pushback given just the sheer magnitude of inflation that’s being experienced in some of these markets, and we are trying to be commercial about that. But, it’s very difficult suddenly to go to a client here who happens to be an investment-grade client and say, "Sorry, we want CPI growth", you’re not going to get that. So yes, we see -- we tend to see more uncapped CPI growth in the international markets than we do here. And yes, but that too is evolving.
Operator: The next question comes from Harsh Hemnani of Green Street.
Harsh Hemnani: Sumit, you mentioned that in the past, sourcing, what you close is roughly 7% of what you’ve sourced. And this quarter, it was closer to 15%. Do you worry at all of the net lease transaction market sort of continues to remain illiquid and at Realty Income, you’re closing $5 billion to $7 billion annually, that you might not have the luxury to be as selective as you were in the past and maybe you have to execute on your second or third best idea. How are you thinking about that looking over the next 12 months?
Sumit Roy: Well, the good news, Harsh, is that we haven’t gone to executing on our second or third best ideas yet. We’re very fortunate. Let me shed some light on this 15% closing rather than what we’ve traditionally done, which is the 7% to 10%. What is skewing this is clearly the $1.5 billion transaction that we closed on in the second quarter, but it’s not reflected in the denominator in the sourcing volume of $15 billion. We had sourced that asset, I would say, probably in the fourth quarter of last year. So, that’s where the mismatch occurs. In some ways the sourcing volume is much more real time, what did we see. And there is generally a lag between when we engage in a conversation, i.e., when it is sourced versus when does that particular transaction get over the finish line or closes. And I think that lag sometimes does create this mismatch. So, if we were to sort of take away the $1.5 billion and then look at the $1.6 billion that we ended up closing in a year that -- in a quarter where we source $15 billion, $16 billion, that’s still 10%. So, I think that’s probably the way to think about this mismatch that we saw in the second quarter.
Harsh Hemnani: Okay. That’s helpful. And then the $1.6 trillion that you provided that there’s $1.6 trillion of commercial real estate on S&P 500 company balance sheet. How much of that is real estate that you would actually want to have in your portfolio? So, I imagine you’re not actively acquiring office assets. Could you share how much of that is maybe retail gaming, et cetera, that you might go after?
Sumit Roy: Yes. That’s a great question, Harsh, and we did that when we talk about $4 trillion here in the U.S. and $8 trillion in Europe. And just to be also super clear about this particular statistics that we shared in the prepared remarks. It does not include other real estate companies. It does not include certain sectors like finance companies, banks, energy companies, et cetera, et cetera. These are operating businesses that have assets. And an easy way to think about it is, let’s assume that half of it is office. Let’s assume that another 20% of it is something that we wouldn’t want. Even if it is 20% or 30% of this $1.6 trillion, that is a massive number. And the point is that these are companies that are going to have to refinance their debt, this $1.2 trillion of debt over the next three years. It’s maturing over the next 3 years. And sale-leaseback should be a conversation that is appealing to them, especially given the cost of doing a sale-leaseback today in this environment versus the cost of refinancing that a lot of these companies are going to experience. That’s really the point.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today. We’re looking forward to seeing many of you at the various conferences this fall. Have a good rest of your summer. Bye, bye.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-04 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please also note, today's event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea Behr, Associate Director of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.
Andrea Behr: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's First Quarter Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy : Thank you, Andrea. Welcome, everyone. We are pleased to report solid 2023 first quarter results, exhibiting continued momentum in our business. I would like to express my utmost gratitude to our One Team whose efforts enabled us to continue delivering on our growth objectives. I would also like to thank our equity and fixed income investors for their continued vote of confidence.  Our team's efforts and the benefits of our size and scale were reflected in our first quarter results, highlighted by approximately $1.7 billion of high-quality investments acquired at a cash cap rate of 7%. This represents a 90 basis point increase compared to the investment cash cap rate we achieved in the fourth quarter of last year and resulted in an investment spread of 163 basis points, which is above our historical averages. As we have experienced in prior cycles, cap rates for our investments after an adjustment period have historically tended to be positively correlated with interest rates, which is a trend we have largely continued to experience this year after the recent rise in rates. Our ability to access well-priced capital has historically served as a competitive advantage and is a testament to our long history of maintaining a conservative balance sheet and a diversified real estate portfolio, supported by clients who are leaders in their respective industries. Amidst an environment in which capital is expensive and are scarce for many of our clients, our value proposition is even more pronounced. This dynamic is reflected in the recent portfolio acquisitions we have announced, the active deal pipeline we see today and the favorable pricing spread we see for large portfolio transactions vis-a-vis one-off single asset transactions. Our differentiated platform extends beyond the external growth lens. Recently, we have taken steps to leverage the size of our portfolio and the history of our operating business through the continued development of advanced analytics. The objective of this initiative is to develop predictive and prescriptive insights that harness the collective proprietary data that we've accumulated over several decades of investing in managing and releasing single-tenant net lease properties. Our team's proprietary predictive analytic tool leverages the strove of information in our investment underwriting, portfolio management, asset management and development efforts enabling even more informed investment decisions made by our best-in-class One Team members.  As our business grows, so too will the predictive power of this tool, which we believe will generate significant value for our stakeholders as we refine the accuracy, test conclusions and broaden scope across industries, property types and geographies. As part of our core investment thesis, our size and scale have created opportunities to serve as a capital provider for best-in-class partners looking for alternative means of financing given elevated debt costs.  In the first quarter, we agreed to acquire up to 415 high-quality convenience stores from EG Group for $1.5 billion. Over 80% of the total portfolio annualized contractual rent is expected to be generated from properties under the Cumberland Farms brand, and we expect to close on this transaction in the second quarter. As illustrated by this deal, we believe our ability to offer not only certainty of close, but also attractively priced capital as a one-stop solution for sale-leaseback transactions is particularly valuable to institutional sellers of real estate today. We believe this will continue to expand our competitive advantage. Internationally, we continue to venture into new geographical verticals and grow the total addressable market opportunity. This quarter, we took advantage of favorable pricing internationally to acquire properties worth approximately $390 million at an initial cash lease yield of 7.6%. After our initial entry into international markets in 2019, we now derive 11.7% of total portfolio annualized contractual rent from those markets. This natural extension of our platform has been a pillar of growth for the last four years and is indicative of our ability to methodically establish and scale a new vertical.  Given the continued momentum in our acquisitions pipeline and our progress to date, we are increasing our 2023 investment guidance to over $6 billion from our prior guidance of over $5 billion. Consistent with our investment strategy, we remain disciplined with regard to our balance sheet. Subsequent to our April bond offering, which settled on April 14 and we held approximately $5.6 billion of liquidity, including unsettled forward equity totaling $1.5 billion. As a result, our current financial position has afforded us the ability to lean into near-term investment opportunities.  Moving to operations. Our platform continues to generate durable cash flows, which support our stable earnings profile. For the first quarter, we are pleased to report occupancy of 99%, matching last quarter for the highest rate at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. Additionally, we generated a 101.7% recapture rate across 176 renewed or new leases executed during the quarter. These results are a reflection of our talented asset management team and our unwavering commitment to core capital allocation principles, which include a focus on industry-leading clients who often operate in a low price point service-based or nondiscretionary industries. Our purposeful diversification across industries, geographies and clients and our emphasis on high-quality real estate locations and rigorous credit underwriting. Our investment philosophy is nuanced and not simply predicated upon the pursuit of investment-grade clients, which ended the first quarter at 40.8% of our annualized contractual rent. Many of our strongest operators, such as Sainsbury's have no public debt and thus are not rated at all. However, the consistency of their operations and health of their balance sheet are favorable attributes that are consistent with those of an investment-grade rated company. We estimate that approximately 5.3% of our annualized contractual rent comes from unrated operators without public debt. We remain committed to investments that offer us attractive risk-adjusted returns as evidenced throughout our history. And going forward, where we believe, based upon our disciplined underwriting and analytics, we are achieving better returns per unit of incremental risk.  I would like to briefly touch on Cineworld which represents 1.3% of our annualized contractual rent. Despite the ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy, we have continued to receive 100% of contractual rent in the first quarter and through April. As of March 31, 2023, we had cumulative reserves of $33 million on our Cineworld properties. Outstanding receivables net of reserves and excluding straight-line receivables were $14.1 million. We remain in discussions with this client and we'll update the market on the outcome of these discussions at the appropriate time.  Before turning the call over to Christie, I would like to highlight that in March, we published our third annual sustainability report which details our ongoing commitment to operating as a responsible corporate citizen for our stockholders, our team, the communities in which we operate and the environment. I'm proud of our continued progress on ESG initiatives as we seek to fulfill our commitment to building sustainable relationships and I strongly encourage all of today's listeners to navigate to the Sustainability page of our website to review the report. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Christie.
Christie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. We work together with our clients and our One Team to achieve a successful quarter on a number of fronts, delivering AFFO per share of $0.98 on behalf of all of our stakeholders. We would highlight that the comparable quarter in 2022 benefited from approximately $10.2 million of rental revenue reserve reversals, resulting in an AFFO per share growth headwind of approximately $0.015 per share in the first quarter of 2023.  In addition, higher year-over-year short-term interest rates represented an approximate $0.02 growth headwind as our weighted average interest rate on revolver and commercial paper borrowings was approximately 300 basis points higher than it was in the comparative period in 2022 on a similar average borrowing base. Excluding these two items, our year-over-year AFFO per share growth rate was approximately 3.5% this quarter. As we evaluate the core fundamentals of our business, we remain focused upon delivering for our stakeholders over the long term and are encouraged by opportunities ahead.  To that end, we are increasing the low end of our AFFO per share guidance range by $0.01 resulting in a new range of $3.94 to $4.03, which represents 1.7% annual growth at the midpoint of the updated range. It has been a busy and productive start to the year on the capital raising front. Despite continued market volatility, we have raised approximately $3.9 billion of capital this year excluding $1.5 billion of unsettled forward equity. In April, we closed a $1 billion bond offering, which was comprised of $400 million of 4.7% senior unsecured notes due in 2028 and $600 million of 4.9% senior unsecured notes due in 2033, resulted in a weighted average tenure of eight years and semi-annual yield to maturity of 5.05%. The issuance allowed us to satisfy our near-term debt issuance needs while reducing our exposure to variable rate revolver and commercial paper borrowings and to almost zero after our transaction closed on April 14.  In March, we increased our dividend for the 120th time since our public listing in 1994, to an annual rate of $3.06 per share, representing 3.2% growth from the prior year period. Providing a stable and growing dividend is core to our mission at Realty Income, and we take great pride in being one of only 66 constituents in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. I would like to thank our One Team whose focus and diligence has paved the way for our continued growth as we build upon our track record of consistency.  And with that, I would like to turn it back over to Sumit.
Sumit Roy : Thank you, Christi. In conclusion, during periods of market uncertainty or dislocation we look to unearth value by leveraging the inherent advantages of our platform. These trends include our continued access to relatively attractively priced capital and our portfolio scale, which we seek to leverage to produce unique investment opportunities as a leading sale-leaseback capital provider. When combined with the collective talents of our best-in-class team members to source, underwrite and close on creative acquisition opportunities with strong risk-adjusted returns, we believe we are very well positioned to continue amplifying our competitive advantages on behalf of our clients and stakeholders. We thank all our stakeholders for their support, loyalty and trust in our company.  And with that, we can open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP Paribas.
Nate Crossett : I was wondering if you could talk about just deal flow U.S. versus Europe. What was the amount of deals you looked at in the quarter? I think that's a number you usually give. And then on cap rates, last year, the spread of like the cap rates in the U.S. and Europe was pretty low. I think it was almost the same. But this quarter, Europe is 60 basis points wider. I just want to know if there's anything to note there.
Sumit Roy : Yes. Thank you for your questions, Nate. Good questions. Let's start with the sourcing numbers. For this quarter, we sourced about $16 billion worth of product, 25% of which was in the international markets. I would say that if you go back to when we started going into the international markets, the composition of international versus U.S. has been roughly around 30%, 70% in that ZIP code, plus/minus 5%. So this is pretty much within that particular range.  What you might have noticed, however, is the amount of closing more recently, both in the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year. The contribution from the international side has been a little bit lower than what you have traditionally seen. I would say that the international business has contributed about 35% of volume in terms of what we end up closing versus closer to 20%, 22% this particular quarter. And the main reason for that is we saw a delay in adjustments on the cap rate side in the international markets vis-a-vis the U.S. markets. We started to see cap rate expansion in the U.S. towards the end of -- middle of third quarter, fourth quarter and obviously through the first quarter of this year. But we didn't quite have the same experience in the UK market and some of the other international markets, till, I would say, towards the end of the fourth quarter. And what was largely making potential sellers reconsider the market was not so much driven by actual trades taking place, but more idiosyncratic to their particular needs. Around redemption issues or refinancings that were coming near term. And that's largely what's driven these opportunistic transactions that we've gotten over the finish line in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of last -- this year. And that's what's resulted in cap rates being substantially higher than what I would call the norm or what we are seeing in the everyday market in some of these international markets.  So that explains the 60 basis point higher cap rate that we were able to achieve. And I might add, this is excellent product largely driven by idiosyncratic issues being experienced by buyers who wanted to get this off their books to meet some of the things that I've just discussed. So that's the dynamic we've seen...
Nate Crossett : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one quick one on development yields. Those are notably below the acquisition yields. Are those just old commitments before rates moved? Or maybe you can describe what's happening there?
Sumit Roy : Yes. And Nate, you've hit the nail on the head. It's exactly that. As you know, development obligations have a much longer lead time. So a lot of what you see in -- you saw in the fourth quarter, third quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, though it's starting to move up, it hasn't moved quite as quickly, largely because what you're seeing filtered through the investment numbers, but transactions that we hit struck, I would say, three quarters ago or four quarters ago. But you should expect to see the yield on development creep closer to what we are actually experiencing in the traditional acquisitions market over the next couple of quarters. So it's just a timing issue. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.
Brad Heffern : Christie, one was wondering if you could talk through some of the puts and takes on guidance and why only the $0.01 increase at the low end given the increase in the acquisition guidance and the expense categories moving in the right direction?
Christie Kelly : Absolutely, Brad. I think first, in terms of what Sumit had discussed and the increase of our acquisitions guidance to over $6 billion, we remain conservative in that front and really looking towards the second half of the year, while things remain strong. As Sumit has discussed, we're really wait and see here as things unfold. I think the other thing, too, in terms of guidance that we've articulated, and I mentioned some of this in my prepared remarks, is really the headwinds that we're seeing from a debt perspective, although we've been very focused on ensuring that we're derisking our balance sheet, and you can see that in the transactions that we've executed through April. We're really looking at where that may unfold in terms of the second half of the year and don't believe that, that will alleviate over and above the competitive cost of capital that we've been able to generate vis-a-vis last year. And I think finally, in terms of the positive trends that you saw in terms of the tightening of the guidance with G&A, we remain particularly disciplined during this macroeconomic backdrop, and are focused on managing our G&A. But further to that, it's the benefits of size and scale. And you can see that over the years in terms of the trends of G&A to revenues. And then finally, from an unreimbursed property expense margin perspective and the tightening there, we're just following in on the positive trends that we've been able to execute upon.
Brad Heffern : Okay. And then, Sumit, just thinking about this EG Group deal, are you seeing more of these very large sale-leaseback opportunities versus what you would normally see? And then has the competition for those deals also thinned out?
Sumit Roy : No, no, Brad. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's timed out. In fact, the momentum has continued, and we expect that momentum to remain strong. I don't know how many billion-plus deals, but these large transactions what drives some of the near-term financing issues that a lot of companies are going to have to deal with. And with what we are seeing play out in the banking sector with fewer banks out there to provide capital, the cost of that capital being what it is, given the interest rate environment, I do believe that sale leaseback will continue to be a very attractive alternative to raise capital to help address financing needs at these companies. Keep in mind, EG had never done a sale leaseback. They had that option for many, many years. And they chose to go down this path largely to address some of the leverage concerns that they had on the balance sheet. And we expect that trend to continue. So -- and that's the reason why that's the impetus behind why we felt we should increase our acquisition guidance by $1 billion. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.
Joshua Dennerlein : Just a follow-up on the EG Group deal. Just curious how that deal came together and maybe your ability to partner up further with them?
Sumit Roy : Thanks for the question, Josh. So EG is obviously a very well-established name in the U.K. market. Neil and I had been calling on them for a while, along with TDR Capital, they're capital providers for a while. And this is a relationship. We knew they didn't have a high level of interest in necessarily going down the path of sale leaseback when we first started to have conversations with them. But I think that, that relationship ultimately played out to our benefit when we were awarded the deal when they did choose to go down the path of sale leaseback to help meet some of their capital needs shorter term. This was a competitive process. It was run by Eastdil. We went through. We were obviously in close contact with EG directly as well. And there were three finalists, and we felt like we were awarded the deal based on our reputation, surety of close and the fact that we had spent time developing a relationship with them. So that's what really got us the deal at the end. And our ability to be creative and there were certain asks that they had and our ability to meet those certain asks also, I believe, accrue to our favor. So I think all of those factors went towards us being awarded the transaction despite us not being the highest bidder.
Joshua Dennerlein : Okay. And then maybe changing the topic a little bit. How do you guys think about expanding or growing your exposure to lower credit quality tenants as a way to kind of widen the aperture and maintain growth?
Sumit Roy : Yes. Josh, that's a very good question. I'm actually going to go back to the EG Group conversation we just had. If you look at the actual portfolio, 80% of the portfolio is Cumberland Farms. And I just want to remind the group that three years ago, when Cumberland Farms was available for sale, they were all of the natural operators that were very, very interested in this very well-run private company. And what was being bandied about as a potential sale leaseback, the pricing was in the low 5s, high 4 ZIP code. And it ended up being EG Group that won the transaction, and they obviously didn't want any sale-leaseback financing to effectuate the buyout. But that was the quality of the real estate. That Cumberland Farms was demanding at that particular time. Fast forward today, the four-wall coverages on these assets have only improved and improved, I would say, dramatically. So the assets remain exactly the same assets, and we were able to accomplish this transaction at 6.9%.  Yes, if you look at EG Group, the credit that's operating these assets, they are sub-investment grade. But if you look at the quality of the assets, it's exactly the same. And we believe that EG Group is a very good operator of convenience store business. We can see that in the history that they have established in the UK, and we certainly see it in the performance of these assets. When you compare it to where they were performing three years ago and was warranting a price in the low 5s, high 4s to where we were able to accomplish. So now you fast forward and you say, okay, you're getting 150 basis points, 160 basis points of additional spread on this real estate, are you being paid for the credit risk inherent in the operator? And that's where the concept of risk-adjusted returns comes into play for us, and it is so front and center in everything we do. The answer for us was a resounding, yes. We are being compensated. And so for us, we've said this before that investment grade rating is a byproduct of the actual underwriting. It is not something that we seek out. It gets taken into consideration on the collectibility of the rent flow over the 20-year or 25-year leases that we underwrite to. But ultimately, we look at every transaction on a risk-adjusted basis. And if it makes sense, despite the fact that it may or may not have investment-grade rating is something that we are going to continue to pursue.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS.
Michael Goldsmith : Sumit you started the call by talking about continued momentum in the business. Can you just talk a little -- REITs tend to be lagging indicators. So can you kind of talk about the visibility that you have into the business and this continued momentum? Just trying to better understand how long of a path that you have where you feel very good about the spreads and the backdrop? Because it seems like it's been -- everything has been pretty solid in the last several quarters.
Sumit Roy : Yes. That's a great question, Michael. Things are moving so fast. Every other day, there's a bank in the news. News is super fast. And so how do we think about our business and why do I use phrases like continued momentum. Even though this may be a lagging indicator, we are looking at transactions, these renewals every day. And when we are seeing the fact that we can still continue to generate 102%, 103% re-leasing spreads, yes, it's lagging, but literally weeks, months. And it gives me continued hope that, look, for our product, where we play in the market, et cetera, there continues to be a fair amount of demand. And it manifests itself in some of the positive re-leasing spreads that we share with the market. The second piece, which is much more of a forward-looking statement is what are the continued discussions that we are having that then helps drive our pipeline on the investment side. What are the kinds of discussions that we are having? What's the size of the discussions that we're having, what's the yield associated with those discussions. I think all of that gives us confidence that there continues to be momentum. The fact that we were able to raise $3.1 billion within a period of three months, in the fixed income market, the fact that we were able to close on $800 million of equity and have $1.5 million of unsettled equity available -- $1 billion, sorry, of unsettled equity, again continues to give me confidence that even on our capital side, for us, we continue to sit in a very favorable position. So we have the opportunity. We have the ability to raise capital. We have the ability to make spreads north of what we have historically achieved. And now with the international markets starting to reflect a little bit more of a positive movement for us on the cap rate side. That's what gives me confidence to say that we have continued momentum in the business.
Michael Goldsmith : My follow-up question is, it looks like you've opened up an office in Amsterdam. Can you talk a little bit about the advantage that you get from that? Should -- does that mean that we should expect more international deals? Or does this allow you to source deals better throughout Europe? And are there any tax benefits from having an office there?
Sumit Roy : Yes. The reason why we needed to open an office in the Netherlands was largely driven by the structure that we have created to allow us the flexibility to continue to grow in the international markets. And by international markets, I primarily mean the UK and Western Europe. This was largely driven by a substance question around having or needing to have employees based in Amsterdam to be able to satisfy this tax structure that we've been able to create to give us this flexibility. So that's largely what's driven a couple of hires that we've made. But most of the other hires will continue to be in the UK and potentially in some of these other countries as we begin to reach a core size in terms of our portfolio. So yes, that's what really drove setting up an office in the Netherlands and hiring a few folks who can help us manage our international business. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Harsh Hemnani with Green Street.
Harsh Hemnani: So we've heard from some of your peers that perhaps cap rates in the U.S. are closer to topping out. Is that something during the second quarter that you're seeing too? And then the contrast that perhaps in the -- in Europe, you mentioned cap rates only started moving there in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of 2023. Do you still see more runway there and perhaps that being a tailwind for you relative to peers? And the spirit of this question is not to say that as European cap rates going to expand over the 7.6, I understand that those idiosyncratic deals might not happen every quarter, but is the trend that you're seeing in Europe upwards? And can that benefit your spread value to the peers?
Sumit Roy : Yes. Thank you for your question, Harsh. I wouldn't go so far as to say that we see cap rates moving even more in the international markets than they have here in the U.S. I mean, just look at where our 10-year bonds are the price is literally one on top of the other. So they're on those advantages today that we had a year ago. So I don't expect that to be a disproportionate movement in one geography or the other.  Could we see situations, however, unique situations that present themselves that is largely driven by used the word idiosyncratic issues? Yes. And that could garner additional cap rates. But as a market, on average, I don't see there being that much more of an advantage in one market over the other in terms of cap rates. And you're right, you said it correctly that the movement in cap rates was slower in Europe than it was here in the U.S., but I think they've largely caught up. Like some of our peers, it is fair to say that we have not seen continued expansion of cap rates vis-a-vis what we've experienced over the last, call it, 1.5 months, 2 months. But that's not to say that cap rates could not continue to move. There's just a lot of uncertainty in the market today with banks as soon as we start to believe that the banking crisis is behind us, is another name that pops up. And as you know, a lot of these regional banks were the lifeblood of providing financing to developers and to other local real estate operators. And so is it possible that those situations could again manifest itself in for sales, where we could be the beneficiary, which could then have an impact on cap rates. Yes, it's possible. That is why I hesitate to say that the movements in cap rates have played out and it's going to remain where it is today. But I think just like our peers, there has been a settling out, if you will, of cap rates that we have experienced, but I'm not sure if I subscribe to the fact that this game has played out. 
Harsh Hemnani: That's helpful color. And then you've mentioned in the past couple of calls where vacant asset sales that your income have been going up. Past couple of quarters, all asset sales were vacant. And you said this is kind of going to be the normal course of business, where if that's the best use for those assets and we have better uses for the capital to go out and buy something accretive? That's going to be what you will do. Can you give us a sense for what the buyer pool for these assets look like? Has that changed at all? The demand for these assets over the past couple of years and say versus recover?
Sumit Roy : That's a tough question, Harsh. What we are experiencing is there is a price for any asset. And if you are willing to accept the price, I think you pretty much can sell an asset. All of what we have accomplished in the first quarter were vacant sales because that's all we really needed to address. And it was about a 6% unlevered IRR, which is lower than what we have traditionally experienced, largely driven by one or two assets that we just wanted to get rid of because we felt like the long-term prospects or even the short-term prospects for that matter, didn't justify us holding on to these assets. But if you look back, it's traditionally been in that high single-digit unlevered IRR. So it gets into the double-digit levered return profile. And that's what we've traditionally experienced. And I think we should be able to go back to that. In terms of the profile of the buyers in this market, I would say most of the buyers that are interested in buying these assets are folks who want to operate out of these assets. They don't want to enter into a lease. They want to control the assets. These tend to be not institutional quality buyers, but local buyers that want to run a business out of that location and want to own the real estate to do so. That's the profile. Now in the past, we used to have, I would throw developers in the mix. And of course, developers keep sniffing around. But given that the debt markets are a little bit more challenging, there's a little less perhaps demand from that ilk of potential buyers. But I would say today, it's largely owner operators that are driving the sales process.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.
Greg McGinniss : So just touching on sale-leaseback again. I have to imagine there's more operators newly considering sale-leaseback financing. Can you just talk about the types of tenants you're having first-time conversations with, who you might be targeting? I don't know if that's cold calls or through brokers or whatever have happens to be and how you go about finding operators that maybe didn't consider sale leasebacks in the past, but would be open to it now. 
Sumit Roy : Yes, it's a slew of avenues through which we source and I think it will be very consistent across the board. Obviously, we believe -- we have a curated list of folks that we've been reaching out to speaking with one of which we've already talked about, EG Group, that we didn't have expectations of sale leaseback in the near term, but it just so happened that, that became very compelling to them as a capital source. There are similar names like that. I'm not going to obviously go into the details, as you can imagine, Craig. But this is something that we do here in the U.S. We do this very consistently when we travel to the U.K. and to Western Europe. There are obviously well identified folks who own a lot of real estate who are not in the real estate business, and those are the folks that we've sort of identified and tried to reach out through. The other channels are the more traditional channels, brokers, investment bankers, colleagues who may have worked in certain places who have an in into those places. All of those are avenues that we exhaust to continue to source our transactions. And those continue to remain the avenues of sourcing.
Greg McGinniss : Okay. And then I guess just talking about source deal volume a bit here, kind of a multi-parter. So first, when you're talking about source deal volume, does that include the deals where sellers just have unrealistic cap rate expectations? Secondly, do you have some idea or some sense of the level of sellers that maybe are just waiting on the sidelines waiting for financial markets to settle out a bit? And third, how much of the deal volume in the past, do you think it was driven by cap rates trending down, which was enhancing exit IRRs that now is probably a thing of the past.
Sumit Roy : So Greg, to answer your first question, yes, even when the cap rate expectations are unreasonable. If somebody is reaching out to us and we've sourced it as a deal, but have no interest in following up, it does get included in our source volume. I would say that a lot of folks, a lot of potential sellers of real estate are sitting on the sidelines. They recognize that the buyer pool is definitely a lot more discerning when it comes to cap rates because they are having to work in the same environment where the cost of that capital is much higher today than it was six months ago. So rather than tainting their product, they're just holding back.  And I think look, I can't prove this 100%. But if you look at our sourcing numbers, it's $16 billion, $17 billion, $18 billion. Those were the three numbers that we had the last three quarters. But it is slightly lower than the $25 billion, $26 billion that we were experiencing in the first two quarters of last year and quarters before that. So some of it is obviously getting played out in the sourcing numbers as well. It's still a very healthy sourcing number. But I think as people wait longer and longer and this turmoil continues, I think we are going to start to see some of these sellers come in and say, look, I have an event, either it be releasing refinancing scenario or what have you, that's going to push them to say, okay, we are willing to accept the fact that we need a higher cap rate. We've had a few of those occasions where 5 months ago or four months ago, we had a grocery operator that came in and they wanted a particular cap rate, and we said that was too rich for us. And we said, okay, this is where we think we could have done that deal. This was about five months ago. They've come back to us today saying, "Can you meet that? And we said, no, we can't. Our cost of capital has moved, but we could do this. And they are willing to transact at that higher level today. So I know this is one anecdotal evidence of how it's taking time, which is why there's always a lag. But it is starting to play itself out. And I do expect sourcing numbers to start to go out. The longer this turmoil on the lending side continues, which obviously creates wonderful opportunities for us.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Eric Wolfe of Citibank. 
Eric Wolfe : I wanted to follow up on what you just said a moment ago and also your comments around the new banks sort of being in the headlines every other day. Just curious whether anything that's happening right now with regional banks has already started to open up new opportunities for you. I'm specifically thinking about industries that rely on their credit. I think you mentioned some local developers. But just anything that relies on regional bank credit where you might see some opportunities today that were historically available to you?
Sumit Roy : Yes. I think, Eric, on multiple fronts, it opens up opportunities for us. Obviously, sale-leaseback as a comparative tool to raise capital, especially when compared against the debt products that's available today, it's very compelling. The cost of that capital raise is lower than what markets are able to satisfy. So I think from the traditional source, it's going to create opportunities. It's also going to create opportunities because you don't have as many lenders today who would have traditionally participated in -- on the secured side of the equation. And there are users of that capital stack that still need to either refinance their capital or just want to raise that in view of doing a sale leaseback. And because of fewer participants, I do think you can position yourself to play in that area because it's very akin to your traditional underwriting with obviously a few more nuances around how you think about debt instruments as an investment. But I think it's going to open up opportunities on that front as well. And a lot of these alternative capital asset managers and capital providers, et cetera, I think they are very well situated to take advantage of those situations as are we. 
Eric Wolfe : That's helpful. And then just a question on theaters. I know small percentage for you. But I'm just curious what you think needs to happen for there to be a more liquid market for assets. And maybe for Cineworld, specifically, once their balance sheet and leases presumably restructured, do you think there will be a market to sell those assets? 
Sumit Roy : I think so, Eric. Look, this is consistent with what I've been saying specifically around in a world we remain in discussions. So I'm not going to get into that. There was some news this morning, which I think is very positive for the Cineworld name, where they've actually put out a date when they're planning on emerging. They've been able to attract new capital. So I think all of that is quite positive. But what I have shared on our specific portfolio is around inbounds. There are certain locations that are absolutely in high demand for alternative uses. So in some ways, this is playing out of what is the highest and best use of some of these locations. And going through this process accelerates that ultimate outcome. And so we are -- look, we think we're going to be just fine. It is, like you said, a very small portion of our overall portfolio. To be very honest, I'm very hopeful that by the time we have our next quarterly call that this will all be behind us. And these opportunities that I've been referencing about basically repositioning some of these assets to an alternative use can start to play out, and we can actually start speaking to you about what those opportunities are. But we feel pretty good about the Cineworld situation. 
Operator: And our next question today comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.
Ravi Vaidya: This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel St. Juste. Last quarter, you commented that your watch list is about of 4% of total ABR. Just wondering what that is right now? And what other categories outside of the theaters are you monitoring or have a negative view on .
Sumit Roy : Yes. Good question. Our watch list today is right around 4.4%. As you correctly pointed out, it is largely dominated by the theater industry. Some of the other areas that we are continuing to look at. And keep in mind that our watch list is not always a credit issue. It is just our view on the real estate, the location of that real estate and what the ultimate outcome is going to look like. So it's a combination of credit. It's a combination of real estate underwriting. But ultimately, the watch list is dictated by the long-term desirability of those locations and operators. So along with the theaters, I would say, restaurants are in the some of the more discretionary type concepts out there like home furnishing. There are very few day care centers and some of the other businesses that are not very well capitalized that you'll find there. But that's the mists of what you will find on the on the watch list.
Ravi Vaidya : That's helpful. One more here. One of your peers sold movie theaters at [7.8], regarding your -- would you consider selling theaters in that range? Or what other -- what are your conversations been like in terms of pricing and regarding the theaters, as you said it was such a large component of the watch list?
Sumit Roy : Yes. That's actually a very good pricing. And I suspect that the person that bought it is probably a developer. And we've done our own analysis. And for us, we feel like the best way to create value would be to hold on to these assets and then especially the ones where we have a view that can be redeveloped et cetera, and capture that view once we have full control of that asset. We truly told there is so much discussion that we are having with Cineworld at this point that I don't want to get into the details, but that discussion needs to be behind us. And my understanding is that a lot of these assets that are now going to be put out there for sale, et cetera, have already had their rents renegotiated, everything has already been priced in. And those cap rates that are being shared are being shared off of those new adjusted rent numbers. And in our view, if we feel like, hey, let's just hold on to these assets, we'd much rather get these assets back and reposition it perhaps with some additional capital, but create much more value for our investors, then that's what we choose to do. And we haven't engaged in trying to go out and try to find the market we've had a lot of unsolicited calls. I can tell you that, but we really haven't engaged in trying to sell any of our theater assets. We want to resolve the Cineworld situation. And I think with the news today, I think that date is certainly getting closer before we start to figure out what the best economic outcome is.
Operator: And our next question today comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.
Ronald Kamdem : A couple of quick ones. Just going back to the opening comments on the international portfolio at 11.7%. Just thinking about where could that number go? Obviously, there's different tax it so forth. But in your mind, how can that number trend in the next couple of years, obviously, opportunity driven.
Sumit Roy : Well, these last couple of quarters, they have still represented 20%, 25% of our transaction volume. So clearly, that over time should continue to drift up. It was drifting up at a much higher clip when we were doing a lot more transactions. And I do expect for us to get back into that more normalized 30%, 35%, maybe even more if certain situations play out. So I'm hopeful to keep growing our pie. Look, we continue to look at new geographies, and especially at a time like this, new geographies that seemed a bit out of our reach are starting to become a little bit more within our reach and more compelling today. So as we keep adding new geographies, as we continue to enhance our relationships, et cetera, I see this number 11% continue to grow and be a bigger part of the overall portfolio.
Ronald Kamdem : Great. And then if I could just touch on sort of two verticals: one, consumer-centric medical to gaming, which I don't think has been mentioned before, but just a quick update on what the opportunity set is looking like? Has it slowed down with the events over the past couple of weeks and so forth? And how are you guys thinking about those?
Sumit Roy : So gaming continues to be of tremendous interest to us, Ron. It's just hard to replicate what we got with the Boston asset. And we have an amazing partner in Craig at Wynn, and we will continue to try to work on trying to find new transactions that I don't know if we'll ever be able to replicate the one in Boston, but of a similar type of a similar dominance in particular markets. So we are looking at transactions. We are looking at transactions every day. And the pricing expectations is perhaps something that we are still trying to work through. And if we can get to and understanding which works for parties involved, I think, and I hope we are able to grow that part of our business, but it's not a fait accompli. I mean it is -- the bar for us is higher. But the good news is there is a product out there that meets that bar. So we are very hopeful. With consumer-centric, we -- that's a business we love. We've been in that business. We've just coined the phrase to sort of define an area of our portfolio that we've obviously been very interested in. And with the dental transaction that we did in the fourth quarter of last year, that helped accelerate that part of the business. Look -- and I don't want to get into the thesis again. I think we've shared that already for a variety of reasons, we like that business. And I think in some ways, this is a business that is getting defined right in front of our eyes, and we want to participate in the potential upside that I see on the real estate side. And so again, partnering with the right operators, forward-thinking operators who share a similar philosophy of delivery of health care, I think will, I hope, result in a slew of transactions for us on the consumer-centric side. So both those areas remain of high interest to us, Ron.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Massoca with Ladenburg Thalmann.
John Massocca : Both on the our market here. So I just have one question. Obviously, there was a same-store decline in [indiscernible], which was kind of explained, but there was also a same-store decline in your QSR portfolio. I'm just kind of wondering what was driving that. Is that some of the credit issues certain franchise operators had earlier this year or something else that's kind of idiosyncratic? 
Sumit Roy : No, no. It's -- look, the overall same-store decline was largely a function of what Christie touched on to explain why our AFFO per share was flat. It was basically -- if you look at the reversals we took in the first quarter of '22 versus the reversals that we took in 2023 first quarter, there was a net $9 million reversal that was very positive in the first quarter of 2022 that we didn't have we had to compare against in this quarter. And when you look at same-store calculation, obviously, that's what drove that very benign same-store growth number. Absent that, if you were looking at just the core portfolio, our growth would have been 1.5%. The specifics around QSR is more driven by a couple of concepts that are not doing very well. Boston market continues to be in the news. It's a very small portion of our overall allocation, I think, basis points at this point. But that is what drags the same-store sales numbers same-store growth numbers for that particular industry. So it's very specific to a couple of names. But overall, like I said, we were around at 1.5%, had it not been for these reversals in the first quarter of last year. .
John Massocca : Okay. And maybe what's the overall view on kind of the franchise restaurant base that kind of rough turn of the year, but have things stabilized at all given kind of the continued strength of the consumer? Or just kind of when you talk to tenants when you look at new deals, what's the outlook there for that specific tenant industry? .
Sumit Roy : Yes. It's what you would expect, John, Casual dining is depending on the concepts, some concepts continue to post very good results. Like Outback, I saw the results not too long ago. They had positive same-store growth. I think Chile has had a similar story. But then you look at other concepts, they're not doing as well. Thankfully, the two that I mentioned are our two largest exposures. But we do have some smaller concepts. And it's a smaller concept that if they don't have the balance sheet wherewithal to increase prices or pass through some of the costs, et cetera. they're going to struggle. And again, it's not -- none of this is a big part of our portfolio and all of which there are areas that we are focused on. It's already part of our watch list. But that's where I expect to see some level of disruption, but nothing new is expected based on what we see today. 
Operator: And our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.
Linda Tsai : Just a quick one. Just a broader question on the overall market. When you look at the amount of dry powder available on the sidelines to deploy towards net lease, which industries are you seeing the most demand?
Sumit Roy : That's an interesting one, Linda. If we just look at it and I look back, I think it's convenience stores and grocery. Those are the industries that we we're able to do the most deals in and -- but that's a selective selection bias that we have. Those are the industries we like. And so I can't answer that across the board. But what I will tell you is, yes, you're right, there's a lot of capital, but that cost of capital is not uniform. That's one of our biggest advantages that we have a cost of capital that continues to be incredibly competitive and lower than almost everyone. So in some ways, we find ourselves in a very favorable position to take advantage of what we are seeing in the market. But we are very focused on areas of interest to us.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to the management team for any closing remarks.
Sumit Roy : Thank you all for your attendance today. We look forward to meeting with many of you at the upcoming NAREIT conference in June. Thank you. .
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-22 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income Fourth quarter 2022 Operating Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Hasselwander, Senior Manager of Investor Relations at Realty Income. Please go ahead.
Julie Hasselwander: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance.  During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-K. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Julie. Welcome, everyone. 2022 was a year of significant growth for our company. I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to the Realty Income team, who have worked tirelessly to execute on our strategic objectives and all of our investors for their support. The result of our team's collective efforts was reflected in our 2022 results, highlighted by AFFO per share growth of 9.2%, the highest annual growth rate for our company since 2013. Additionally, we closed on approximately $9 billion of high-quality investments in 2022, including $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter, both the annual and fourth quarter investment volume set record highs for the company. Underpinning investment activity, transaction flow remains robust. We sourced $17 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing 2022 sourcing volume to $95 billion. Finally, we ended the year with occupancy of 99%, our highest occupancy rate at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. At Realty Income, we strive to provide stability and sustainable growth on behalf of our investors. And during periods of economic uncertainty like we find ourselves in today, the resilience demonstrated by our business model is important to highlight. During our 28-year history as a public company, our combined total return consisting of AFFO per share growth and dividend payments generated by our operations has not experienced a single year of downside volatility in the form of negative total returns. We believe we are in a very limited company among companies in the S&P 500 who can make that claim. This is a testament to the durability of our underlying cash flows, which is supported by a diversified portfolio of properties under long-term leases with clients that are leaders in their respective industries. We are constantly working to incubate new swim lanes for growth that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. Since the start of 2022, we have expanded our [technical difficulty] new verticals to our platform. In October, we completed our debut transaction in Italy, acquiring seven wholesale clubs operated by Metro AG, an investment-grade pan-European leader in the wholesale club industry. As we discussed in 2019, when we purchased our first property internationally, we are intentional about consolidating the fragmented commercial real estate market in Europe and Italy represents the third country abroad in which we now have a presence. In December, we closed our $1.7 billion acquisition of Encore Boston Harbor resort and Casino from Wynn Resorts, which represent our first transaction in the gaming industry. The property is a good example of our strategy to partner with best-in-class operators to acquire high-quality real estate. It was purchased at a discount to estimated replacement cost, is subject to a long triple net lease of 30 years with attractive annual rent escalators and is located on prime real estate with structural barriers to competition. As anticipated in August 2022, Massachusetts partially legalized professional and collegiate sports wagering for the state, unlocking an estimated $850 million of gross annual gaming revenue and further supporting the strategic importance of this asset. In addition, we are pleased to announce a significant investment in what we are calling the consumer [technical difficulty] through the acquisition of a 224-property portfolio of dental practices during the fourth quarter. We expect this $520 million transaction to be just the start of additional investments we hope to make in a sector that we estimate has a total addressable market in the U.S. of nearly $1.8 trillion in real estate. We believe the consumer-centric medical industry shares many of the same attributes of the nondiscretionary service-based uses that make up much of our portfolio, and that have proven resilient throughout our company's long history. These locations offer essential goods and services in and around the major thoroughfares in which our assets are [technical difficulty] for properties leased to clients in the consumer-centric medical industry is extremely fragmented, which creates consolidation opportunities, we believe we are well suited to address. We believe this industry will continue to move towards a patient-centric model. The trend towards the outpatient model has been ongoing for decades, but we expect this shift to occur in an accelerated fashion post pandemic and will manifest in several ways that support our investment in the industry.  First, the convenience of having care delivered closer to the patient will increase accessibility to the patient and reduce costs for all, including patients, payers and providers. Second, existing clients of ours like Walgreens and CVS will continue to disrupt the status quo as they gain an increasing share of primary care over time. And third, we believe these industry dynamics will help lower the per capita spend on health care in the U.S. and help improve the quality of outcomes. It is also important to note that the adjacency and fungibility of these assets are a strong fit with our existing footprint from a real estate standpoint. As we underwrote this industry, we conducted a study analyzing over 30,000 variables and found that our portfolio had a 90% similarity with a data set of assets in this industry and we look forward to increasing our exposure over time.  Moving on, as we announced earlier this week, actually yesterday, we have entered into a strategic alliance with Plenty, an emerging leader in vertical farms operations to support the development of Plenty's indoor vertical farms. As the initial transaction of the alliance, we will fund the development of an indoor vertical farm asset near Richmond, Virginia, located adjacent to an Amazon distribution facility. Plenty's highly automated farming architecture efficiently harnesses scarce natural resources to generate production yields that it believes are up to 350 times greater per acre than conventional farming. We regard Plenty as the forefront of a structural evolution in crop production and [technical difficulty] growth plans. In summary, these distinct new verticals are representative of the growth opportunities we expect to unlock over time to create value for our shareholders.  Moving on to our portfolio. In addition to our record occupancy at year-end, we are proud to have delivered a rent recapture rate of 103.8% during the fourth quarter on properties renewed or re-leased, bringing our full year recapture rate to 105.9%. We attribute these results to our proactive asset management efforts, the underlying quality of our real estate and our rent levels in the portfolio relative to market. Despite our recent accomplishments, we are still working through the impact of the pending bankruptcy on our Cineworld exposure, which is 1.4% of our total portfolio annualized base rent. As a reminder, -- we own 41 assets, 17 of which are subject to a single master lease agreement and 22 of which have been accounted for under cash basis accounting since the third quarter of 2020. Following the announcement of the Cineworld bankruptcy in September 2022, we have collected 100% of contractual rent in each month from October 2022 through February 2023. As resolution on the bankruptcy has not yet materialized, we deemed it appropriate to revisit [Indiscernible] as we've had on our Cineworld receivables balance as we continue to evaluate the collectability of these amounts.  As a result of this analysis and in an abundance of caution, in the fourth quarter, we recorded $13.7 million of additional reserves associated with nine Cineworld properties previously on accrual accounting. In total, we now have $35.6 million of cumulative reserves on 31 properties that are on cash basis accounting, representing approximately 70% of our outstanding receivables from Cineworld. As a result of these changes, our unreserved receivable outstanding from Cineworld was $15.6 million at year-end, excluding straight-line rent receivables and including both deferred contractual rent and deferred expense recoveries. The 31 properties on cash basis accounting currently account for approximately $2.6 million of monthly contractual base rent. Based on public information and our proprietary analysis, we continue to believe our portfolio of Cineworld assets generally comprised of the stronger performance in the operator's portfolio, and we will provide an update on the outcome of our negotiations when appropriate.  Finally, in January, we were pleased to welcome Greg White as Chief Operating Officer. The COO role has been vacant since 2018 when I assumed the role of CEO. And having known Greg for many years, I believe he has the experience, leadership qualities and business acumen to add immediate value to the management team.  Most recently, Greg served as a senior adviser in the Real Estate and Lodging Investment Banking group at UBS Securities. I admire Greg's extensive knowledge of the commercial estate space and his thoughtfulness and integrity will mesh well with our culture at Realty Income. I will now pass the call over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter.
Christie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. Moving on to the balance sheet. As publicly disclosed, we've been quite active on the capital markets front. During the fourth quarter, we raised approximately $52 billion of equity proceeds primarily through our ATM program and when including equity sold in the first quarter of 2023, and we currently have approximately $850 million of unsettled forward equity available for future issuance. Throughout 2022, a we raised over $4.6 billion of gross equity proceeds at a weighted average price of $67.04, almost entirely through our ATM program. We ended the year with net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA in our targeted range at 5.5 time or 5.3 time giving effect to the annualization. Please note that these ratios do not reflect the outstanding equity forwards I referenced previously. Our capital market activities in the fourth quarter and in January were aimed at striking the right balance between terming out our short-term borrowings while providing us the flexibility to participate and a lower rate environment over the next three years. In addition to the 10-year $750 million senior unsecured bond issuance we priced in October at an effective yield of 3.93%. In January, we executed a dual tranche $1.1 billion senior unsecured bond offering. The offering consisted of $500 million three year notes callable after one year and $600 million of seven-year notes. In conjunction with the three-year note, we capitalized on an attractive window to swap our interest payments from a fixed to variable rate structure, which we expect will replace a portion of our existing variable rate exposure in the capital stack. After giving effect to the interest rate swap, we effectively locked in a variable rate spread of negative 3.5 basis points to SOFR, which represents estimated savings compared to our credit facility of over 85 basis points. It is important to note that the $500 million of variable rate exposure is expected to be in lieu of variable rate borrowings we would otherwise have outstanding on our revolver or on our commercial paper program. Lastly, in January, we closed on a new $1 billion multicurrency unsecured term loan with an initial tenor of one year and with two 12-month extension options. In conjunction with closing of the term loan, we entered into a variable to fixed-rate swap resulting in an all-in effective yield of 5%.  I would like to take a moment to say thank you to each of our lenders that participated. [technical difficulty] I would also like to make special mention of Jonathan Pong and Steve Backe for their tireless efforts and leadership in delivering upon our capital market strategies. Moving on to guidance for 2023. We are initiating AFFO per share guidance of $3.93 to $4.03, representing 1.5% growth at the midpoint of the earnings range and including our current dividend yield, a total operating return profile of circa 6%.  So, the annualization of higher interest rates has moderated our expected growth rate for 2023, there is much to be optimistic about. The investment pipeline remains active. We continue to source investment opportunities across our target markets at accretive cap rates in the mid-6 to mid-7 range. As a result, we are introducing 2023 investment guidance of greater than $5 billion, and we will, of course, revisit this guidance each quarter as we gain incremental visibility to our transaction pipeline. Finally, as the monthly dividend company, an increasing monthly dividend remains central to our business model. We were pleased to have announced a dividend increase of 2.4% last week which represents a 3.2% growth rate over the year ago period. We remain proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having a dividend every year for over 25 consecutive years. With that, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. In summary, our 2022 results demonstrated the capabilities of our platform and the competitive advantages afforded to us given our size, scale and access to capital. Over the long term, we believe stockholders will continue to benefit from the stability of our cash flows as we have proven with our track record of consistently positive total returns. Finally, we believe there is significant runway for further growth in untapped industries, geographies [technical difficulty] We look forward to unlocking these opportunities over time. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joshua Dennerlein: I wanted to ask about the Plenty indoor farm deal. I guess this is a new industry for you guys as well as it seems like a relatively new industry in general. I guess how did you guys get comfortable with underwriting the risk and outlook for indoor farming?
Sumit Roy: So, thanks for the question, Josh. Indoor farming, as part of the revolution that we are seeing in ag tech is something that we've been looking at for the better part of a year now. And specifically working with Plenty to try to understand their technology and how they're going to play in the ecosystem in terms of delivering crops in a much, much more efficient manner than traditional farming. If you look at ag tech and you look at vertical farming within this space, this is estimated to be a $50 billion industry over the next few years. And Plenty has a very established position within this particular vertical. If you look at some of the sponsorship that they have, it's with companies like Walgreens, Albertsons, and Driscoll’s. These are some of the largest grocers and providers of end product to grocery stores. And Walmart has also invested directly in this company, along with [technical difficulty] from which they're going to be served the end product. So, they have a lot of institutional sponsorship. We've gotten to know the company very well. And at the end of the day, it's a $42 million investment, very well-located industrial location happens to be very adjacent to an Amazon box.  And we felt very comfortable based on the risk-adjusted return profile across various different scenarios that this was going to be a solid real estate investment. Having said all of that, one of the phrase that was used internally, the cherry on the top was the fact that this aligns with our value system as well, the value of giving more than we take. We genuinely believe that ag tech and vertical farming, specifically is going to have a big role to play in a world that continues to be resource constrained, yield constrained, water constrained and continued deficiency of arable land going forward.  So, for all of those reasons, we got very comfortable with Plenty as an operator, and more importantly, this particular vertical within ag tech as an industry to pursue.
Joshua Dennerlein: And then could you maybe elaborate a little bit on like the returns and the outlays, I know it's a $1 billion pipeline. Like is that something you expect to kind of put out the door all this year over the next 2, 3 -- and are you guys financing the equipment inside the warehouse? Just trying to get more color on the deal.
Sumit Roy: Sure. So, we are a real estate company, Josh, first and foremost. So that's all we are going to be investing in. Any equipment, all of the technology, et cetera, that is Plenty's responsibility. And so, none of the $42 million will go towards that. The $1 billion is a number that we hope to be able to invest with this name, which if we do would mean that this technology has become a success, and more importantly, this [technical difficulty] its position as one of the leaders in vertical farming. The investment itself has a much longer horizon, I would say, potentially the next five years. But keep in mind that any subsequent investment beyond the $42 million is on -- is at our option. And so obviously, we are going to approach this partnership from a purely real estate perspective. But a perspective that we do believe needs to partner with these types of technologies in order for these technologies to be successful. But ultimately, the real estate needs to work for us on a risk-adjusted return basis. And if that does, we are happy to help a company like Plenty continue to establish itself as a front runner in this space.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Anthony Paolone: Great. Thank you. Sumit, can you expand a bit on the consumer medical vertical that you talked about in terms of what are the types of service offerings that are most interesting to you right now? What do those boxes look like, types of operators, so forth, yields, maybe?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So, when we're talking about consumer-centric medical, we're talking about stuff that we are already currently exposed to and adding a few more areas around the edges. So, what are those areas? Like we are already exposed to drug stores, but drugstores of yesterday is not the drug store of tomorrow. What you've probably heard in the press both Walgreens and CVS are investing very heavily to continue to take share of the physician -- the general physician services. And this is an incredibly fragmented area of the business, and they are investing multibillion dollars in their health hub, minute clinics, et cetera, to [Indiscernible] be able to provide those services.  And so that will continue to be an area, infusion centers, dialysis, eye care, dental care, pediatric care, behavioral facilities, urgent care, those are all concepts that have gained tremendous momentum, especially post pandemic, and will continue to gain momentum as a method of delivering health care to the end consumer. And the belief here is that the per capita health care cost that we in this country experience is essentially 2 times the average of what an OECD company -- country experiences. And how do we continue to bring that down? And factors like convenience, being closer to the consumer, making sure that there is a relationship that can be established. So, issues can be addressed on the front end rather than when it becomes an issue later on in life. I mean, today, if you look at the U.S. health care, only 30% of the population actually has a general physician that they can identify as their own. 70% don't have one, and this goes back to preventative care as being a precursor to reducing the cost of health care. And that is the business model that we have embraced that we believe will be -- in addition to the traditional ways of delivering health care will be a very important step in helping reduce cost. And so, anything that sort of lends - any concept that lends itself to this will be open season for us. And what we have then looked at it is to try to analyze the actual boxes that these types of facilities are housed in. And what we found was that there is a 90% -- and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, there's a 90% overlap with locations and boxes that we have in terms of size, in terms of [Indiscernible] et cetera. And there are a whole slew of variables that we looked at. And these assets that lend themselves to consumer-centric medical. And so, there are a lot of synergies. It is incredibly fragmented. It's a $1.8 trillion market today, expected to grow to $2 trillion by 2027. And it's all about increasing our total addressable market, using our core strength that we bring to the table to help consolidate the market and continue to sort of redefine what net lease investing is. And this is a perfect example  [Technical difficulty]  you had -- if you were saying something post the end of my answer, we missed all of that. So, you're back on.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. Sorry about that. And then my second question relates to yields and thinking about just near term, like the first and second quarter, I think you mentioned mid-6s to mid-7s. You did 6.1 in the fourth quarter, but just -- does it -- should we expect that it moves into that range here in the near term? Or is that a number that you might get to over the course of the year? Just trying to think through what you're seeing on the ground today?
Sumit Roy: Yes, Tony. We actually put out some numbers on January 9, we put out, I think, a pro sup when we were offering the unsecured bonds, where we shared the pipeline with you, and then the pipeline included transactions under contract and accepted LOIs. And that was circa $1.3 billion worth of transactions, a 7.1% cash cap rate. So clearly, what we are talking about in terms of finally the cap rates moving is now manifesting itself in the pipeline that we have created or we had created until that point.  And now more stepping back and more generally speaking, we have seen about 100 basis points plus/minus movement in cap rates, which we expected given that if you look at even 14 of the top 20 clients that we have, who have bonds that are trading, you look at what their spreads have done over the last, call it, eight months, nine months, those have gapped out about 100 basis points. So not that, that symmetry is perfectly congruous, but it seems to have been at least in terms of how cap rates have played out. So, you should be expecting to see those numbers being realized starting in the first quarter of 2023.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Greg McGinniss: Good afternoon. Sumit, regarding M&A, is that more or less likely in this environment with these opportunities you're finding in other verticals and portfolio discounts like we saw in CIM 71 cap? Or I mean, this paying a premium for public peer makes sense at this time?
Sumit Roy: Greg, that's a great question. Look, -- the -- if you look at the organic market and you've mentioned CIM and some of the other transactions that we've talked about already, there are very good transactions to be had at incredibly good risk-adjusted returns. Having said that, if there's an opportunity on the M&A front where you're able to realize similar economics, I don't see that as being mutually exclusive to be able to pursue both avenues of ultimately what we are charter to do, which is grow the business. But it does have that backdrop to compete against as an opportunity cost when we are looking at M&A. But I don't see there being less M&A because of the environment we find ourselves in. It's just the question of are we going to have partners who are willing to see the big picture, we're willing to see that being part of a particular pro forma company is better for the outlook than not. I think those are the elements that need to sort of play out on the sellers' behalf, in order to perpetuate M&A transactions. But look, we are very happy going down the path that we have -- that we are going down. We did $9 billion of acquisitions last year. I would say that, that's probably -- if you look at companies in our sector that takes care of 80%, 90% of what companies are in terms of their total size. So, we don't have to do M&A in order to continue to grow our business. self, and it makes sense for us to pursue that. We are not going to shy away from that either.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. That's reasonable. And just for a second question here. Have the higher cap rates started to bring some of the private and private equity buyers off the sidelines? Or is competition for assets still limited?
Sumit Roy: They're certainly out there. The debt capital markets continues to be a constraint for them and their ability to react quickly in this market. I think certainty of close over the last six months has taken on a very different focus for potential buyers who, for a variety of reasons won't monetize their real estate.  And somebody like us, especially when it comes to bigger deals that can have that certainty of close that does not rely on the debt capital markets to finance their deals. I think has a distinct advantage which truth be told has played out in our favor over the last few months. And so yes, private equity will obviously start to sniff around given the higher cap rate environment. But I still don't think that their cost of capital is as competitive as ours and our ability to close still, I believe, stands out when potential sellers have to evaluate who to partner with.
Greg McGinniss: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. 
Spenser Allaway: Thank you. As it relates to cap rates, we've heard that the bid spread has compressed faster in the U.S. versus Europe. Is that consistent with what you've seen? And do you think that will dictate how you deploy capital in '23 as you look across both geographies?
Sumit Roy: Yes, that's a great question, Spenser. It doesn't have a perfect answer. If you look at the fourth quarter, we didn't do a lot of volume in Europe, circa $350 million, but they had a substantially higher cap rate. And the dynamic that played out there was essentially redemption issues that a lot of funds started to face towards the end of the year.  And that sort of precipitated monetizing their real estate portfolios to help meet those redemption issues, which obviously created an opportunity for somebody like us who, again, does not rely on the debt capital markets, is able to do transactions fairly quickly. And that's what resulted in that much higher cap rate. Because for the longest time in Europe, things were not moving. And that's the reason why the volume was only $387.9 [indiscernible], essentially happened towards the later part of the year, happened very quickly because of the specific dynamics. In the U.S., the trend has been slowly moving in this direction. And again, I think I mentioned this during our third quarter call, much faster than it had traditionally moved when you have a rising interest rate environment. And that's just because so much of the capital was pulled out of the market that it pushed specially sellers who are inclined to monetize their real estate, continuing going down that path has allowed for the cap rates to move.  Having said all of that, I do believe that where we find ourselves today is more of a bottoming out of that continued movement of expanding cap rates. And it's settling in the 6.5%, 7% for some of the products. Of course, there are still products that's trading in the high-5s. There's still some one-off assets that's trading in the low-5s, maybe even in the high-4s. We, in fact, sold one of our QSR assets with a 4% in front of it in terms of cap rates. So those markets, we will ignore because those are the tail areas of the cap rate environment. But by and large, we have seen this movement in cap rates play out and it's now starting to mentioned.
Spenser Allaway: Okay. That was extremely helpful. Thank you. And there have been headlines regarding a EUR600 million to EUR700 million portfolio being marketed for which has been cited as a bidder. Is there anything you can share on the portfolio in terms of the general makeup or geography of those properties?
Sumit Roy: Yes. I wonder what your sources are, Spencer. We really don't want to talk about transactions that we don't have under contract. So -- we may or may not be involved in the transaction that you've mentioned. We can't speak to anything, which is a hypothesis or just a rumor in the industry. Sorry about that.
Operator: Our next questioner is Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Sumit, good afternoon. Just curious on an updated perspective on your high-grade philosophy here. I noticed again in the fourth quarter. The share was below your portfolio average even when you back out the Encore. In the past, I know you mentioned -- you have experience in acquiring higher-yielding assets and you're focused on the best risk-adjusted returns. But yet again, it's another quarter, your share of high-grade is far below the portfolio average. So maybe can you kind of give us some updated thinking on how we should think about that dynamic maybe going forward? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: I think you've sort of answered the question that you asked, Haendel. Ultimately, this is a game of finding the best risk-adjusted returns, just like you said, and the fact that something tends to be investment grade is an output of that underwriting. It's not something that we seek out. And the counter to what you're seeing in the fourth quarter is a CIM transaction, for instance. Here, we have an $894 million transaction with 48% of the rent coming from investment grade. And we were able to get a healthy cap rate. So that number is going to continue to move. In fact, if you were to just look at the $3.9 billion we did in the fourth quarter and like you did exclude the wind transaction, and one of -- a couple of the larger portfolio transactions that we did, that particular investment-grade number would be right up in the high 40s. So, that's going to fluctuate quarter-by-quarter. And what we need to get comfortable with is based on the risk that we are assuming and part of which is the credit risk are we being appropriately compensated. And if the answer comes back, yes, based on expected outcomes, then we are very comfortable continuing to pursue those transactions.
Haendel St. Juste: That's helpful. I wanted to ask about Italy for a moment. Was the investing in the quarter basically the $350 million in Europe that you mentioned in of your earlier remarks? And then maybe can you talk a bit about the relative risk profile, how you're underwriting there versus perhaps the rest of the Europe or the United States? And what's the, I guess, investment appetite for Italy?
Sumit Roy: Look, Italy, as a country, definitely has more risk. But again, -- just like when we invested in the grocery business during the midst of Brexit, and we were very particular about the industry and more importantly, the operator within that industry that we were partnering with. If you look at Metro AG, it's an investment grade, very profitable, very well-established business, which is pan-European, I believe it's headquartered in Germany, and it controls 26% of the wholesale business in Italy. They have been established since the early 1970s in some of our locations. And so this is a business that we feel very comfortable with. Think of Metro as a combination of Costco and Cisco. Costco is very much retail-oriented and Cisco is much more professionally oriented. Both those businesses types of businesses is served out of Metro, and that's not going anywhere despite some of the additional country-specific risk that might exist in Italy. There are structural advantages as well that I'm not going to bore you with, which makes Italy a very interesting place to invest. But we are going to be very particular, just like we were in the U.K. and we were in Spain as to who we partner with, what are the concepts that we are going to be exposing ourselves to. And at the end of the day, what is the risk-adjusted return profile, look, taking into account some of these risks in some cases, additional risk that won't takes going into these new countries. But we feel very good about the investment that we've made with Metro in Italy.
Haendel St. Juste: And just if I may, the follow-up is, did you -- is it $350 million in the quarter and ballpark, what are the going in cap rates or set of returns?
Sumit Roy: No, it wasn't all of $350 million. $350 million was the total investment that we made in Europe. I believe the Metro was €165 million or €165 million was the Metro investment. Most of the other investments were in the U.K.
Haendel St. Juste: Cap rate?
Sumit Roy: You've got the blended cap rate, I believe, in the supplemental. It was 100 basis points north of what we did in the U.S., 7.1% cap rate. Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Kamdem: Just can we just touch on tenant health really quickly. Obviously, occupancy is 99%. I see that the EBITDAR coverage is up slightly quarter-over-quarter. In the past, you sort of talked about sort of stress testing the tent and feeling pretty good. Just outside of the movie theaters, just where is your head at in terms of potential recession and tenant health.
Sumit Roy: That's a great question, Ron, especially entering into 2023 with so much uncertainty. Look, our biggest focus right now is on Cineworld and how that's going to -- what that resolution is going to look like. I do believe that whatever that outcome is, it's going to play out within the next few months. It's been in bankruptcy now for the better part of four months, and we have been in negotiations with them, and we'll leave it at that. Outside of that, if you look at our overall -- and again, this is something we share in the supplemental our cash flow coverages, full wall cash flow coverages, those have continued to trend up, largely a function of some of our existing clients continuing to outperform. Companies like Albertsons, et cetera, have continued to generate EBITDA growth on a four-wall basis, and therefore, those coverages have continued to improve. Some of the new transactions that we have entered into have very healthy four-wall coverage ratios. And this is, again, it very much ties in with the comment that I think it might have been handled was talking about why are we doing so many noninvestment-grade. If you look at it from a real estate perspective and you suddenly have coverages north of 4x, 5x in sound businesses, but they don't have an investment-grade rating given their size. Those are businesses that we will pursue. And so that's the reason why our four-wall coverage ratio is now close to 2.9x and it was in the 2.5 or about a year ago. So the health continues to be fairly good. If you look at what is there on our watch list, it's about 4% of our rent is on the tenant watch list. And as you can imagine, a lot of it is driven by the theater business. A lot of the theater assets are on our watch list. And in some cases, we also have assets that may not have a credit issue, but there is a location risk associated with what will happen at the end of the lease term, given the changing demographics, changing competitive landscape, et cetera, et cetera. So that constitutes our 4%, which is slightly higher than what it was a few quarters ago. And it's largely a function of what's happening in the theater space and what we expect will happen in a continued high interest rate environment.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And then my second question, just touching on gaming. Obviously, the Encore deal closed. How is that going out as you have the assets and more importantly, what's the pipeline look like? How are you guys thinking about more -- doing more acquisitions in the gaming space.
Sumit Roy: Yes. So, we are very proud to own this beautiful asset in Boston. We just had a demonstration internally about our presence on LinkedIn and Twitter. And when we posted the news release around closing on this asset, we had a huge jump in following. So clearly, it was appreciated by the audience following Realty Income, and we are very proud to have this partnership with win. They are great operators. They are very good to sort of continue to understand and learn about this particular industry, and we hope to grow this industry. We didn't do this as a one-off opportunistic transaction. And -- it's very much in line with looking for the best operators and trying to get assets that are going to be icons for the given operator, but even outside of that. And I think we have checked all of those boxes on the Boston asset. But finding those types of assets will continue to be we are focused on. And as you can imagine, we have received several inbounds. But for a variety of reasons, we haven't chosen to pursue them because they don't need all of the attributes that we are looking for. So, we will be selective in this industry, but we would absolutely love to grow it over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: There's been a lot of M&A activity in the value-based care. So I was wondering if this is the industry you're referring to, where you see all the opportunity? And if so, would you get the parent's credit on some of these deals?
Sumit Roy: End up looking at Oak Street Health, for instance, that CVS ended up buying and they want to monetize some of those real estate then yes, by default, we are going to ask for CVS' credit on this $10 billion transaction that they just consummated. Walgreens has done a similar transaction. Amazon just announced that they did a similar transaction. Yes, it is precisely what we are talking about. We are calling it consumer-centric because we are approaching it from a pure state perspective and trying to find what are the alternatives of the locations that we have already -- and how does -- what are the synergies with this new vertical that we're pursuing. It's certainly not looking at what traditional health care companies are focused on. That's not our forte. That's not our strength. And that has really no interest to us today. But it is the value-based health care that a lot of forward thinking health care companies, operators, health care operators are pursuing. And the derivative of that will be the real estate. It could be our existing pharmacies that are going to be repositioned to health hubs and minute clinics. That's already happening. There's continued enhancement, there's continued higher impediments to switching costs that are getting created. Those are all perfect for us. That's embedded value that doesn't get realized day one, but we love to see that happen. And we also want to be intentional about growing the portfolio by doing the types of transactions that we did in the fourth quarter in this particular area because we do believe in it.
Wes Golladay: Got it. And then would you have, I guess, a lot of ground redevelopment opportunities? And then also, it sounds like you would have some redevelopment opportunities. Have you ever done redevelopment funding before? Or is that a big part of the business now?
Sumit Roy: We've certainly done redevelopment funding, Wes. If you look at our pipeline dollars today and some of that is repositioning of our existing assets. And we've done some in-house. We've done a lot of it with partners, national partners that we have. And those have been some of the best recapture rates that we have achieved in our portfolio. So when we talk about this 90% overlap in terms of real estate characteristics, of the locations that we currently own and some of these consumer-centric medical concepts, that certainly lends itself to repositioning some of our assets for highest and best use. And we define highest and best use in terms of rent per square foot that we could recapture for a given location that we already own. And so yes, I'd hope to be able to partner with these operators, show some of our existing vacancies, potential vacancies that are going to come down the pike. And reposition these locations to help provide these types of services. So yes, that is out of a value-enhancing proposition that we're going to explore.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Can you talk about your view on interest rates in the capital markets based on your recent capital raising activities? It seems that Jonathan and Steve were busy with several less traditional items with the term loan with multiple extensions and the callable unsecured? Just trying to get a sense of what you're trying to achieve based on the laddering with these instruments.
Jonathan Pong: Michael, it's Jonathan. I would say, the activities that we did in January, early January, it's all about financial flexibility. We, if you noticed, did a three-year non-call one, giving us that flexibility after one year to call at par. We also did a one-year term loan, but what two one-year extension option. And so, what we're trying to avoid, especially since we went long on the curve earlier in 2022 with our debt capital raising efforts, what was the lock in rates that these levels are very attractive to us. We would like to think that over the next three years, there will be a more advantageous window for us to tap into the debt capital markets to term these amounts out. And so, it's really about maybe a little bit of a barbell given the activity we did earlier in the year, much lower long-term rates, but also terming out the revolver to an extent and creating that flexibility for us to participate and lower rates if they come.
Michael Goldsmith: And my second question, we've talked about each of the new verticals in depth, but just wanted to talk about the big picture associated with this. Does this -- is this a function of something has fundamentally changed with kind of the traditional core retail assets or industrial assets that you are known for. And I guess, does this -- these new opportunities provide more confidence in your ability to consistently hit or exceed the $5 billion of acquisitions that you've guided to the last couple of years?
Sumit Roy: That's a very good question, Michael. It's a question that we've asked ourselves. There is a traditional definition of what a net lease company does. And yes, we can certainly be mandated and dictated by that or there was a way for us to step back and say, look, if we look at Realty Income, what is our core strength today, our size and scale, which people have continued to point to as impediments to growth. If you look at the last four years, we've grown our business at 5% CAGR annually. And if you look at the business, this question has been asked for the last 10 years was, we are going to take what has been used by The Street as an impediment and see if we can garner value for us shareholders, and let's just ask the question, what is it that we can do with the core strength of size, scale, cost of capital, that will be difficult for other companies to follow. And if the answer was, sorry, you're constrained by your business model and this is all you should do, and this is all you can do, that would have been the answer. But what we found once we started last the question around redefining this particular space is that there's plenty for us to do. And we are only constrained by our ability to be creative. And ultimately, if we continue to underwrite these verticals and look at it from the perspective of real estate and look at it from the perspective of a net lease suddenly, the answers that start to pop up are very different. And it allows you to do things and allows you to be very creative and create outsized riches for our shareholders. That with due respect, a lot of our peers are going to struggle trying to mimic. They just don't have the scale. And so, if we can help consolidate real estate, through a net lease structure, that is really the only governing principle that should be constraining us. And ultimately be able to show to the shareholders that on a risk-adjusted return, these are as safe, if not in some cases, safer than investing in traditional retail net lease businesses, then it's a win-win. So that's how we are thinking about the business, Michael. And you will continue to see us be very creative. But like I've always done, and like this team here has always done, we will engage with you to share our thesis. And by the way, I do highly encourage everyone to go to the new deck, the investor deck, where we've laid out our thesis in more detail, and you'll see some numbers around -- and you'll find that this is what I think people invest in Realty Income for, and we are just delivering on that promise.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.
John Massocca: So, we're reaching about the hour mark here, so I'll take us back to the beginning a little bit. As we think about the delta in the Plenty transaction between the $42 million committed for the Virginia projects, and the $1 billion headline opportunity? Do you have some kind of like right of first refusal or purchase option to kind of get to that higher number? Just trying to kind of figure out what's in the remaining amount beyond the $42 million for the actual project that's underway?
Sumit Roy: So John, the best way to answer that is any real estate development outside of a carve-out for one particular client that I mentioned already, which is a user of their end product, we basically get to take a look at the opportunity. And then if we wish not to pursue it, we don't have to. But we, as their real estate partner will be given an opportunity to look at any real estate development that they enter into over the next five or six years. There's a time frame associated with that. But ultimately, the goal here is to continue to invest because that would mean that they are becoming a more and more successful operator within vertical farming, and we are their real estate partner going forward. But yes, so it is a concept of the optionality lies with us in terms of how much more we invest.
John Massocca: Okay. Understood. And then can you provide a little more color on the dental portfolio acquired in 4Q? What made that specific portfolio attractive? And can you provide some color on the credit behind of those assets?
Sumit Roy: So it's not rated. It was a situation where you had the operator own both the operations as well as the real estate. And this was a mechanism for them to monetize their real estate and continue to invest in the operations of the business. I think we are very constrained by what it is that we can share. This was a highly negotiated transaction but it is one that we are very excited about. And this is, again, an advent into this consumer-centric medical real estate in a big way, and we felt like it was large enough for us to sort of engage in and talk about, but we can't be more specific than that. You know what our overall cap rate was for the quarter, and this was a very small component of it, given that it was a $4 million quarter. But that's the extent of what we can do about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: What are some of the benefits you hope to achieve by filling in the vacant role of the COO?
Sumit Roy: Greg is sitting right here, and he's already -- he's been with us about 1.5 months, and he's already added so much value to all of our discussions. It's very bright mind and now he's going to start blushing, but he's somebody that I've respected. I've known Greg for the last -- I guess now it's almost 15 years. And he has a perspective that he brings to the table that is very unique and is going to be incredibly additive to all of us. Look, our business is becoming more and more complicated. We are becoming a bigger and bigger organization. We need talented people to continue to that. But the most important thing about Greg, in my mind is his integrity and his ability to -- and his leadership qualities and his ability to mentor -- those are all qualities that will be put to good use, especially with the next batch of leaders that we are cultivating internally and he will be a massive help in accelerating them to very senior leadership positions within the Company, which, by the way, this company will need in order to continue to execute its strategy and plan.
Linda Tsai: And then just in terms of recurring CapEx being less than 1% of Realty Income's NOI, does this vary whether the properties are domestic or international? And are your new verticals consistent with this threshold to?
Sumit Roy: It depends on the type of leases that we have. I will tell you that, for example, an industrial lease tends to have structural and roof responsibilities, that's on the landlord. And so obviously, CapEx there, not maintenance CapEx necessarily, but just CapEx in general -- is going to be higher. Now some of it will be viewed as maintenance. Some of it will be viewed as improving the life of the real estate. So the categorization of that CapEx may be different, but it is very much a function of the lease. I would say that in the U.K., there is even on the retail side, there is not perfectly what we call quad net assets. So we do have a lot more leakage. But lot more leakage is a relative term to very little leakage here in the U.S. And so all said and done, it's not a big part of our business. It's something that we share. It's part of the AFFO. And again, all of that is underwritten when we are thinking about the long-term return profile of investments that we make, obviously take into consideration on the front end before moving forward on transactions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Tayo Okusanya: Just a quick follow-up on Haendel's question. So again, doing a little bit more in the non-IG space, your watch list is a little bit bigger. On the flip side, your rent coverages are getting stronger and stronger. How do we think about just kind of credit provisioning on a going-forward basis with all these kind of in factors and what you kind of look at as kind of adequate provisioning relative to historical levels, does kind of given the business backdrop.
Sumit Roy: Yes. Tayo, it's not a perfect science. You've put forth two data points that we've shared with you that are polar opposites. How in this backdrop of uncertainty we have four-wall coverages that continue to improve, yet we are doing less and less of investment grade, but that goes back to the underwriting. And I already mentioned to you that there are a couple of retail names that are not investment-grade but to have coverages north of 5x. And again, it's a question of are these businesses that we are comfortable with. With the backdrop of this high interest rate environment, we are not going to be doing transactions where you're going to have an operator that doesn't have a business model that can sustain what we are going to experience, especially in the near term because that would not be good.
--: But last year was a phenomenal year for us. We had a similar provisioning that we kept adjusting throughout the year and ended up actually having bad debt expense below what we have traditionally experienced in the business. So again, we expect the worst we underwrite to what we expect and allow for the better outcomes to play out. And that's really how we think about our business, Tayo.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay. Could you share any specific numbers about the provisioning of like 60 basis points or 75 basis points is the bogie?
Sumit Roy: You mean in terms of what we have in the earnings guidance?
Tayo Okusanya: In the guidance, yes, in the guidance.
Sumit Roy:
--:
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Josh Dennerlein: Just one more, just on the tenant front, I don't think we touched the watch list, saw some news on kind of -- or the Red Lobster has been in the news, I guess, they closed a few stores. Any kind of updates on the watch list and maybe just Red Lobster in general?
Sumit Roy: You missed it. Somebody else asked us about the watch list. It's right around 4%. You brought up Red Lobster, there were rumors around that Red Lobster was trying to negotiate rents with landlords, I can unequivocally tell you that, that is not the case, at least they haven't reached approached us. There certainly was assets that they have closed again, none of which impacted our portfolio. And there are some challenges with that operation. It represents about 1% of our rent. But again, I do think that some of the missteps that they had made in the third, fourth quarter of last year have essentially been reversed. They were slow to make pricing adjustments. They have rectified that. And they are managing their inventory much better and all of those should result in better performance. But I just wanted to make sure that we were talking about facts and not rumors that have percolated in the rumor mill.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.
Sumit Roy: Well, thank you, Dave, for hosting us, and thank you, everyone, for joining in. I look forward to seeing you guys in the upcoming conferences. Take care.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-03 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to Realty Income Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, that this event is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Andrea Behr, Corporate Communications Manager. Please go ahead.
Andrea Behr: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Andrea. Welcome everyone. At Realty Income, we pride ourselves in having a consistent and dependable business model. For 53 years as an operating company, we have persevered through a variety of macroeconomic climates and our track record of stability notably during periods of volatility is particularly relevant during current times. We sit here today well positioned and operating very well across all areas of our business. We are grateful for all of our team members who make the success possible. To start off, we capitalized on opportunities to bolster our balance sheet in the third quarter, including raising over $2 billion of equity on the ATM with approximately $700 million of proceeds received during the third quarter as well as over $1.3 billion remaining subject to our settlement on a forward basis in alignment with our capital strategy. In addition, we issued $750 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes in October to further increase our liquidity. Between cash and cash equivalents, our availability under our credit facility, our liquidity as of the end of the third quarter was over $2.5 billion, which when combined with the $1.3 billion of our unsettled forward equity and approximately $744 million in net bond proceeds equates to liquidity of approximately $4.6 billion had the forwards and net bond proceeds being received at quarter end. Moving on to acquisitions. During the quarter, we acquired approximately $1.9 billion in high-quality real estate, bringing us to approximately $5.1 billion in acquisitions year-to-date. A significant portion of the properties purchased in Q3 were part of portfolio deals or large transactions. We believe these deals were accessible to us because of our size, scale, relationships, ability to close, access to and cost of capital together with our research and technology-driven analytic capabilities. For Realty Income, our competitive advantages allow us to design and execute on strategies that benefit all those we serve including our clients. The pending $1.7 billion Encore Boston Harbor transaction, which we continue to expect to close this year remains an example of this dynamic. Based on our current total portfolio annualized base rent, the transaction would comprise approximately 3% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent, once closed. Further leveraging our international capabilities, we made our advent into Italy last week investing approximately €165 million in seven high-performing wholesale clubs, operated by Metro AG in major Italian cities like Rome and Florence. Metro is a pan-European leader in the wholesale club industry and operates almost 700 stores across Europe. Metro is publicly listed and investment-grade rated, and has continued to perform well during and since the pandemic. We are delighted to add them as a client and hope we will be able to add to this initial portfolio over time. During the third quarter, we did experience cap rate expansion registering a 6.1% cash cap rate on investments, which compares favorably to the 5.7% cap rate we realized our investments in the second quarter. This resulted in a third quarter investment spread, of 165 basis points based on actual capital raised, which is higher than our year-to-date total of 161 basis points and above our historical average. As we move towards year-end, we continue to see cap rates push higher as capital costs increase. This is consistent with the historical correlation we've come to expect, which has tended to preserve investment spreads as the market adjusts. Transaction flow remains strong with sourcing volume totaling approximately $18 billion this quarter, bringing year-to-date sourcing volume approximately $78 billion. We remain selective as we have acquired approximately 6.5% of sourced volume year-to-date. The international market continues to be an important part of our strategy and it remains an active component of our volume, representing approximately 33% of investment volume in the third quarter. Capital recycling continues to be a strong component of our funding strategy, which also has the dual purpose of culling noncore properties from the portfolio. During the third quarter, we sold 34 properties generating net sale proceeds of $142 million, at an unlevered IRR of 12.8% illustrating the full cycle attractiveness of owning net lease real estate under long-term leases.  We intend to continue to act opportunistically to dispose of assets at moments in time when we can obtain attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition to the disposition of properties on our balance sheet, we also sold our interest in seven properties owned in an industrial JV that we assumed as part of our VEREIT merger. The gross purchase price totaled $905 million, at a low 4% cap rate. Our share of net sale proceeds was approximately $113.5 million. Our core portfolio continues to perform and by and large our clients have generally continued to perform very well despite the cyclical market changes and shifts in consumer behavior. A point to note, as previously publicly announced one of our clients Cineworld commenced Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September. Despite being one of its largest landlords, Cineworld represented only 1.5% of our total portfolio annualized base rent as of Q3. We'll continue working closely with Cineworld, as this process continues towards resolution. For some color regarding theaters, for the third quarter 2022, we collected approximately 85% of the contractual rent across our theater portfolio, as Cineworld Group plc was not yet required to pay rent for the month of September. For the month of October 2022, we have collected 100% of the contractual rent across our theater clients including Cineworld. For some specifics, our Cineworld portfolio consists of 41 properties, 17 of which are subject to a single master lease agreement and 22 of which have been accounted for under cash basis accounting since the third quarter of 2020. Through September, we have recognized $23.5 million of cumulative reserves on these properties, representing primarily contractual rent and expense recoveries that have not been collected, dating back to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. These 22 properties on cash basis accounting currently account for approximately $1.6 million of monthly contractual base rent or 40% of our total exposure to Cineworld. Based on current public information and our internal analysis, we continue to believe our portfolio of Cineworld assets are generally comprised of the stronger performance in the operator's portfolio. Our locations are freestanding, single-tenant assets, typically with large land areas and close proximity to population centers, supporting potential conversion to residential, industrial or life science uses. We have received reverse inquiries from multifamily and industrial developers exploring opportunities on these sites. We believe there is alternative and adaptive reuse potential if Regal were to vacate any locations as part of bankruptcy. Moving on to some of the most important key operational metrics, delivering value that continue to demonstrate a consistent well-positioned real estate portfolio. At the end of the third quarter our occupancy was 98.9%. In Q3, we released 169 leases and achieved a rent recapture rate of 108.5%, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 106.7%. As we look forward, less than 4% of our contractual base rent comes due through the end of 2023, providing strong visibility into our near-term portfolio performance. At quarter end, approximately 43% of our portfolio's total annualized contractual rent was generated from investment-grade rated clients. Our properties leased to clients in our portfolio watch list represented less than 4% of our portfolio's annualized contractual rent. Lastly, our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date and we continue to expect full year same-store growth to be approximately 2%. At this time I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter.
Christie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. Put simply, it was another productive quarter for us. In the third quarter our business generated $0.98 per share of AFFO, representing 7.7% year-over-year growth. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAR was 5.3 times or 5.2 times giving effect to the annualization of net investment activity during the quarter. These ratios do not reflect the $1.3 billion in outstanding equity forwards we had at quarter end. As Sumit previously mentioned, we were both active and prudent in our capital-raising efforts since the end of the second quarter. In addition to raising over $2 billion during the quarter at an initial weighted average price of approximately $68 per share, subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $750 million bond transaction, the majority of which served as a synthetic euro offering to take advantage of favorable foreign exchange dynamics, while also allowing us to return to the US dollar public fixed income market, which we last accessed in 2020. In conjunction with this offering, we executed a US$600 million to euro 10-year cross-currency swap, resulting in the receipt of approximately $612 million in euro proceeds, an effective fixed rate euro-denominated semiannual yield to maturity of 4.7%. Additionally, giving effect to $500 million of interest rate hedges, which were terminated with the operated, we generated a $72 million cash settlement gain at pricing, which when amortized over the 10-year tenure of the note is expected to result in an effective semiannual yield to maturity of 3.93%. Financial flexibility has long been a hallmark of our strategy and our ability to move between various financing markets given our international capital needs is a competitive advantage. As previously reported in the third quarter, we upsized our US commercial paper program from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and established a euro commercial paper program with a capacity of $1.5 billion. The combined $3 billion commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our multicurrency $4.25 billion revolving credit facility, gives us the flexibility to efficiently match fund our short-term funding needs in various currencies at much lower rates than comparable US facility borrowings. As we look forward, we have limited near-term refinancing risk as only $23 million of mortgage debt comes due through the end of 2023 and our next unsecured debt maturity is not until 2024. With continued stable and consistent results in the quarter, we tightened our AFFO guidance range by $0.06 to $3.87 to $3.94, maintaining the midpoint at a 9% year-over-year growth rate, consistent with what we initially provided a year ago. As the monthly dividend company Realty Income's dividend will remain sacrosanct to our mission. This is a testament to our confidence in the time-tested consistency of our business model, supported by a conservative balance sheet and diverse real estate portfolio leased to clients that are leaders in their respective industries. In September, we increased the dividend for the 117th time and for the 100th consecutive quarter, representing a 5.1% increase compared to the dividend declared one year ago. We are proud of these accomplishments and the work our talented colleagues perform every day to help drive this consistent track record. Earlier this week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of our VEREIT merger. We've grown together as one team over the last year and I'm pleased that we remain on track to realize over $50 million in run rate annual cost synergies that we estimated when we announced the merger. And with that, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thank you Christie. Our strengths have been accentuated in this quarter's result. While we cannot control the macroeconomic forces that periodically introduce volatility in the capital markets, I am regularly reminded that the resiliency of this team and the inherent stability of our business model allows us to look to the future with confidence. I'm pleased that we are able to lean in to market conditions when it's advantageous to serve our shareholders, and I believe that the best is still ahead of us. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Now we’ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Brad Heffern, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brad Heffern: Hey, good morning out there, everyone. Cap rates on acquisitions were up 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Looks like some of that's related to the mix of industrial and investment grade, but can you talk about how much of that was underlying market cap rates moving? And was there a particular goal to pursue higher cap rates to preserve accretion?
Sumit Roy: It's more the former than the latter. We are definitely seeing movement in cap rates. If we were to compare it to what -- where the environment was at the beginning of the year, which is what I would say we saw over the last couple of years and compare it to cap rates that we are seeing today and what we experienced in the third quarter, I would say retail cap rates have moved circa 100 basis points. And it's a story of basically two ends of the credit spectrum. If you think about the high investment grade grocery assets those at the beginning of the year were trading in the low four cap rate range and those have moved the most. I would say today they are in the 5.5% maybe even in the 5.6% ZIP code. So that's about 150 basis points. And then on the other end of the spectrum, it was the higher yielding cap rates that had compressed quite a bit over the last few years that also saw similar movement. But the stuff that was in between has seen movements circa of 100 basis points and that's really what is starting to translate into actual realized cap rates that you noticed for the third quarter. Having said all of that, things don't happen at the spur of the moment. I mean, a lot of these transactions -- we started to have discussions with our potential clients about the movement that we were seeing in our cost of capital, which was quite brutal and quite immediate. And thanks to the relationships, thanks to our ability to close all of the things that I enumerated in my prepared remarks, some of the more institutional type clients were also experiencing similar dynamics and we're more than willing to adjust cap rates to continue to do business and continue to fund their respective businesses. And I think that's what you saw translating to the 40 basis points of increased cap rate that we were able to realize in the third quarter. But it is a timing thing. I just want to be very careful that depending on -- if for instance if the gaming asset in Boston, if that were to have closed in the third quarter that's already been sort of -- it's a transaction that's going to have a 5.9% cap rate that's going to sway the overall cap rate. So, it really is a question of when did those transactions get under contract and what is the timing of close that's going to dictate, what the quarter results are. But having said all of that, I think we are definitely seeing movement and it is in the quantum that I described earlier. It's a similar story on the industrial side. I would say, that industrial cap rates have also moved considerably and this is something that we started seeing even in the early part of the year. I think in my first quarter comments, I had talked about maybe seeing a 25 to 50 basis point movement. This was on the heels of Amazon announcing, that they are no longer going to be big takers of industrial assets. They accounted for about 20% of the volume, over the last few years. That started to see some movement -- that resulted in some movement on the industrial side. And then that movement continued through the second quarter. And I'll say today, despite what we quoted in our joint venture that we sold in the low 4s, I would say, similar assets that we were pursuing are in the 5.5 ZIP code today. So, there's clearly movement. And the hope is that the movement will continue in the right direction, over the next coming months. And our portfolio is a testament -- our portfolio, as well as our pipeline is a testament to that.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Appreciate the detailed answer. Christie, I was hoping you could walk through the puts and takes on the new guide. Obviously, you had headwinds from FX and from higher rates. I'm curious, what the offsetting factors were they kept the midpoint the same. Thanks.
Christie Kelly: I think Brad, you captured the headwinds together with the strengthening US dollar. I think in terms of where we see opportunity, is first as it relates to the determination on our AFFO per share, is the overall developments and as it relates to our clients that are on cash accounting. I just want to note that for Regal, we have no change associated with the status of Regal and in the midpoint of our guidance are expecting full collection. A couple of other things, is also just our access to the international borrowings, which are a nice tailwind and you can see that demonstrated in what we were able to do with the euro commercial paper program. And as Sumit articulated, our relationships with clients our ability to pivot in the marketplace, together with our strong pipeline and the timing of the Encore transaction, which could be a positive or a negative. Hope that helps, Brad. 
Brad Heffern: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question will be from R.J. Milligan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. 
R.J. Milligan: Hi, good afternoon. I'll start with my boiler plate question for the quarter, and certainly appreciate the attractively priced capital, you guys were able to source in 3Q, but I'm curious how you view your current weighted average cost of capital and what kind of spreads you've been able to achieve here quarter-to-date. 
Sumit Roy: Yes. So, the spread we were able to achieve third quarter year-to-date was right around 161 basis points and this is based on actual capital raised throughout the year. And for the quarter, it was closer to 165 basis points. And one of the things I'll point to is that in our investor deck, I believe it's Page 26, we do lay out precisely how we calculate our cost of capital. And there are basically three components to it, one of which is the free cash flow that we are generating. -- as well as the cost of equity loaded for the cost of raising that equity and our bond prices. But there was a strange thing that played out in the third quarter, and I don't know if I've got this fact 100% right, but we reached a 52-week high as well as our 52-week low during the third quarter. That was the level of volatility that we experienced, and we will call it luck, call it Jonathan Pong doing his thing, -- we were able to raise a lot of our equity capital on a forward basis with an average price of $68, and that's $2 billion worth of equity 700 of which we obviously was able to -- we were able to close and settle at the end of the third quarter and $1.3 billion of which we will settle at the end of the fourth quarter. And so that's the reason why I want to be very precise around the actual realized spread versus what traditionally has been a calculation of average WACC over a given period. This is the first quarter where we felt like there was a massive diversion precisely driven by the volatility that I just spoke about. But yes, that's how we calculate our WACC.
R.J. Milligan: That's helpful. And so given the fact that cap rates in general are starting to move higher, but probably not as quickly as the cost of debt. How are you thinking about acquisition volume as we move into 2023? Is it time to maybe tap the brakes, sort of keep the pace, or do you think there's going to be more opportunities to potentially even accelerate the pace?
Sumit Roy: Yes. R.J., it's going to be a function of how quickly the cap rates adjust. Clearly, there are mechanisms available to us on the capital side on the financing side that we are going to avail of -- but that's limited in terms of what is the ultimate spread that we can realize. And we are being incredibly disciplined around making sure that the team is pivoting to hurdle rates that we need to achieve on the cap rate side in order to continue to maintain spreads that we feel like represents the right spread for the kind of risk that we are taking based on the acquisitions that we are pursuing. And I think I mentioned this in the second quarter, but I'll say it again, I have been pleasantly surprised with how quickly cap rates have moved. And again, based on some of the transactions that we are seeing in our pipeline, we are very optimistic that we'll be able to continue to maintain the spreads that we have historically maintained -- and we see that over the continuing next few quarters. But timing will be of the essence. Like I said, if there are certain transactions that we entered into, especially on the development side, that was 12 months ago, those are going to not be quite as accretive as transactions that we are entering into today, which will potentially close in the fourth quarter and some of which will close in the first quarter that have spreads that are more in line with what our historical spreads have been. So timing is going to be of the essence in terms of what we report at the end of a given quarter.
R.J. Milligan: Make sense. Thank you for the color.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, R.J.
Operator: Thanks. Next question will be from Greg McGinniss, Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Greg McGinniss: Hi. Good afternoon. Sumit, deal sourcing is still significant, but it's also slowed each quarter in 2022 even, while potentially casting a wider net internationally. What are the drivers of that trend? And do you expect it to continue that way into Q4 in 2023? And how might that declining investment opportunities impact acquisition levels and cap rates? 
Sumit Roy: Yes. It's a good question Greg. And it goes back to having sticky sellers. Sellers who haven't quite embraced the changing cost of capital environment, who are hoping for this to have a shorter duration disruption and starting to recognize that given what the Fed is doing, given what they're seeing on the inflation side that this may be a longer process than what they had anticipated. I think that is part of the reason why you saw a tailing off on the sourcing side. We were averaging around $30 billion per quarter. Third quarter I would still claim was quite robust with $18 billion worth of sourcing, one-third of which was from the international market. And so on a relative basis, yes, there was a bit of a slowing down and it's largely being driven by the time it takes for sellers to adjust to the new environment. And there too it really is a story of those that are institutional sellers they are able to adjust to it a lot quicker than some of the non-institutional more private owners of real estate for whom it has taken and will take a little bit more time to adjust. 
Greg McGinniss: Great. That's fair. Then just going back to the portfolio deals or transactions that you mentioned in your opening remarks. Can you provide a little more detail on the size of some of those deals asset types and whether that's maybe trend that you expect us to move into maybe that seller is just more willing to accept the current financing environment for what it is? 
Sumit Roy: Yes. I think, the way I'll answer that question is to say in large portfolio deals, which tend to be owned by institutional owners they're far more receptive to the changing cap rate environment and far more accepting of the changing cap rate environment. And so it will come as no surprise to you that over 70% of what we did were portfolio deals in the third quarter. It should also come as no surprise to you that some of the institutional owners of real estate were far more willing to enter into sale leaseback as an alternative source of raising capital, especially, given their traditional sources of capital which may have been the leverage finance market or the high-yield market and the disruption that they saw there. And so about 50% of what we did in the third quarter were largely -- were sale-leaseback transactions. And so I think that will give you a flavor for some of the transactions that we did. It was still mostly I want to say 94% was retail and there was about 4%, 4.5% of industrial assets that we did, but largely driven by what we are seeing on the retail side. 
Greg McGinniss: Great. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Next question will be from Michael Goldsmith UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. International acquisitions represent about 33% maybe lighter than what we've been seeing. The opportunity set just larger in the US now relative to Europe. Or are you seeing anything in Europe that you want to highlight in terms of pricing or sentiment and recognize that also comes at the time when you moved into Italy? 
Sumit Roy: I'll tell you Michael I mean we were doing north of 50% in the international markets in the first quarter. We did north of 50% in the second quarter. We are at one-third of the total volume in the third quarter. Again, it really is a function of the timing of close et cetera. Having said that, I will say that the sellers in the US are far more accepting of the changing financing environment than perhaps in Europe. And Europe is by country. It's a smaller market. And so it does take a little bit longer for things to adjust. Having said all of that, we are finding very good opportunities in the UK. And now with the advent into Italy I believe that momentum will continue. Because for precisely some of the reasons that I think we touched on during the second quarter, the debt markets are very unsettled. It has a very high cost associated with it. And that's driving some of the transactions actually on both sides of the pond. But one of the additional dynamics that we are seeing play out in Europe is some of the pressures that some of the funds are feeling. And in order for them to raise the appropriate level of capital, monetizing real estate is creating opportunities for us. And so I wouldn't read too much into it. There is still a very, very healthy pipeline that we have within Realty Income. And the sourcing volumes continue to be yes, lower than what we saw in the first half but still very healthy. 
Michael Goldsmith: Thank you, Sumit. And as a follow-up grocery is in your top 10 industries. Kroger is one of your top 10 clients. Does consolidation in the grocery industry give you any pause or change your opinion about kind of the future of this sector and as a product type within your portfolio? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Sure, Michael. Look I mean anytime you have consolidation the question needs to be asked who is doing the consolidation? If Kroger is going out there and this is a publicly announced transaction with regards to Albertsons, Kroger is still BBB rated. S&P reaffirmed the rating, although they did put it on a negative outlook. And they're acquiring Albertsons, which is a BB-rated credit still solid rated. But I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing. Now there are obviously a lot of other social issues that we have to also address and take into consideration. But from a pure credit standpoint it's actually -- it's a stronger outcome for us that suddenly 30 basis points that we have of Albertsons that has a BB credit associated with it, is now going to get enhanced to a BBB rating. So from a purely a credit perspective, that's not necessarily a bad outcome for us, but that obviously doesn't address a lot of other issues that should be addressed. And I think is percolating through the markets today, around the viability of this combination. But by and large there isn't a standard answer that all consolidation is good. It really does depend on the specific situations.
Michael Goldsmith: Got it. Thank you very much.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we have a question from Wes Golladay of Baird. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hey everyone. Just a question on the hedging, a lot of the ForEx volatility and interest rate volatility is that making it easier or harder for you to hedge cost effectively?
Jonathan Pong: Hey Wes, it's Jonathan. Look it's been a very volatile FX environment as we certainly saw in the third quarter. I wouldn't necessarily say that's been harder to hedge. I mean, these are all very liquid currencies that we're looking to hedge going out very short-term. And so from that dynamic, yes, it's difficult to understand where these rates might be going but the mechanism itself nothing has really changed. On the hedging front, I would say that when you look out the next 12 months we are around 50% hedged at this point on earnings. And we aspire to get to our hedging program where hopefully going forward rates aren't the story -- FX rates aren't the story of any quarterly earnings. So rest assured we're very mindful of that.
Wes Golladay: Got it. And I want to touch upon Regal. It sounds like you're pretty optimistic under an adverse scenario for the cash basis tenets. So I guess question number one do you overall expect a positive outcome here? And then question -- part two of the question was for the master lease asset. That's -- and all are typically is how we view it. In your history is that typically the case where do these ever get negotiated for a modest haircut? I guess, what should we embrace for based on historical precedent?
Sumit Roy: So Wes, there isn't one single answer that can address the master lease question. It is very much jurisdictionally dependent, depending on where the bankruptcy is playing out. And in this case, I think, I believe, it's in Texas. It's a function of how they're going to interpret the strength of the master lease. But yes, having a master lease certainly does accrue certain benefits to us. And it should be viewed as an all or nothing situation. But we can't guarantee that going forward. We'll see how it all plays out. With regards to Regal and the ultimate outcome, you read a fair amount of optimism into some of our prepared remarks and when we have answered questions directly. That is a true read. I'm not saying that, Regal will continue to run 41 assets when they emerge from Chapter 11 but what I am telling you is the ultimate economic outcome, on this portfolio, we feel very comfortable about. And a lot of it has largely been driven by unsolicited inbounds that we have been receiving, even on some of the assets that we recognized to be not very good performers and recognizing that the best use for these assets perhaps may not be a theater asset going forward but something totally different. And when you start to look at where these are located the amount of land in some cases north of 10 acres creating a mixed use or a multifamily makes it tremendous amounts. And value creation opportunities for us to partner with some of these developers can create a lot of value for us. Yes, it's going to take time, but we feel fairly optimistic that the ultimate economic outcome on this portfolio will be one that we will be very comfortable with.
Wes Golladay: Got it. Thank you very much for that.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: Next question will be from Ronald Kamdem, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey. Just a couple of quick ones. Just back to sort of the tenant health. You sort of talked about Regal which was really good disclosure. But any sort of other tenants that are of material size whether it's 50 basis points, 100 basis points on the watch list that we should be thinking about? And how are you guys -- and can you just update us on what the reserve for bad debt is looking like so far year-to-date?
Sumit Roy: Yes, I'll take the question around do we have more than 50 basis points -- 50 basis points for any other clients outside of Regal and the answer is no, we don't. Our total watch list is less than 4%. It's actually 3.9%. And we don't have any large clients on this watch list outside of Regal. Regal is the largest one. We do have some other clients on this in the health and fitness industry et cetera. But again from an overall perspective we feel pretty good about it. In terms of -- I'll have Christie answer the other part of your question. 
Christie Kelly: In terms of reserves Ron total reserves are $33 million. And just dovetailing with what Sumit said in regards to the watch list and what we've already made publicly available it's really primarily a story around Regal and the reserves that we have on the books associated with Regal. 
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And if I could sneak in -- my second one was just look if you take a step back and you think about sort of the company the balance sheet when the rest of the capital markets are sort of challenged it seems like this should be the environment where you guys can thrive and I think you sort of mentioned some of that in your opening comments. But I guess my question is just going back to sort of the acquisition volumes and the cap rate, just trying to get a sense of how much sort of pricing power, how much can you guys actually ask for higher cap rates right thinking could this be 25, 50, 75 basis points cap rate higher given that you do have such sort of advantaged cost of capital when others are looking for it?
Sumit Roy: Ron I don't want to overstate the environment. You just need one other competitor to come in and undercut what the normal situation would dictate in terms of cap rates to continue to keep a lid on cap rates. Having said all of that, if you look at the trend lines, there is no doubt that cap rates are moving and they're moving much faster than -- and I've said this before -- than what I expected. It is also true that clients with whom we have relationships, we've been able to enter into contracts with them, where we've asked even from where we first started, and didn't have a contract to when they came back and reengaged with us and said, look, the cost of capital environment has changed for us. This is what we'll be able to do. They're still chosen to work with us, exclusively, and these tend to be larger transactions. So, there is no doubt that having fewer competitors out there, who have the cost of capital to be able to transact that spreads that would be acceptable to their investors, creates an opportunity for us. And this is a relative gain. We have been able to move cap rates, but I think it would be overstating, if I were to tell you that everything that happens going forward, we are going to be the beneficiary of. That's not the case. But we will do better than our share. I think that, Ron you can take away from what I'm saying.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. Thanks so much.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question will be from Harsh Hemnani of Green Street. Please go ahead.
Harsh Hemnani: Thanks. Going back to the portfolio transactions piece, your peers have pointed out that there's a trade-off between acquisition volume in cap rates. You can always drive higher volume on cap rates in the fives. But it seems like because of the ability to drive larger portfolio deals you can drive both higher volumes than them at higher pricing. So, I guess, could you point out, how much of – how many basis points of pickup you can get on a portfolio transaction versus maybe a one-off single transaction deal? And how long you think, it will take for these higher cap rates to show up in the single transaction market?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. Harsh, that's a very difficult question. But if you are forcing me to answer that question, I would say, anywhere in the region of 20 to 30 basis points, 35 basis points. And if that – if the transaction size continues to be bigger and bigger, you're going to start going beyond that is how you should think about it. There is a dearth in this particular environment of potential buyers being able to write large checks, and that is our single biggest advantage today, along with the fact that obviously on a relative basis our cost of capital has held up. But it is going to be very much asset-by-asset, portfolio-by-portfolio discussion in terms of what is that delta between the one-off market and the portfolio market. In terms of how long is it going to take, I'll tell you that, a Chick-fil-A – 15 year Chick-fil-A will still trade in the force today. There is enough buyers – private buyers who can write a check for $5 million or $4 million who don't necessarily need to rely on the debt markets in order to do so. And so it's a tough question to answer in terms of how quickly the one-off market is going to adjust. There will be an adjustment, there's no doubt because even a lot of the private buyers would lean on the debt markets to finance some of their asset purchase. But it's tough for me to – I mean, I saw this Chick-fil-A example literally a week ago, and I asked the team what is the ask and what do you think it's going to trade at. And the answer was mid-4s. And so how long will it take for that to adjust? Who knows? The good news here is it helps us on the disposition side. And if we have one-off assets that we feel like we can take advantage of this market we'll certainly do so. It's not a big part of our business. But like I said more than 70% of what we buy are portfolio deals. And so there I think we are getting the kind of differential that it warrants. And so we continue to focus on that side of the business.
Harsh Hemnani : Thanks. And then just considering the timing of moving into Italy, you mentioned that cap rates in Europe haven't reacted as much as those in the US, and it seems like the economic outlook might be slightly worse for Europe tenets as in the US. Given that backdrop what caused you to enter Italy today? And I guess, more importantly, what prompted the debt swap that was swapped into euros which suggests that maybe you're expanding more into Europe?
Sumit Roy : Well, certainly part of that swap was to help finance, the transactions that we have in Europe including the one that we did with Metro. Look that's a fantastic transaction. We started having conversations around this transaction if I want to -- maybe at the beginning of this year perhaps even late last year. And it's a very interesting geography Italy is. It's the fourth largest GDP in Europe. It is one that we feel like, we can find these types of transactions with investment-grade rated or highly rated operators executing very good businesses, who are looking for real estate partners. And that's the reason why we find Italy to be very fascinating. And we haven't disclosed the cap rates. But suffice it to say it was a very healthy cap rate. And even in this environment is allowing us to capture spreads that are very acceptable to us. The point about Europe that I want you to take away is not so much that cap rates taking longer to adjust. It is adjusting. It will take longer. But to your point I think the pain in Europe is going to be a lot longer than the pain that we are planning on experiencing here in the US. And therefore it will create opportunities. And we want to be front in line to take advantage of those opportunities. And I think under Neil's tutelage, the team is very comfortable continuing to cultivate the relationships that they have established and -- in some of the areas that we would like to grow our business. That work is already being is already underway. And so this is going to continue to be a very important area of growth for our business. And I want to remind you Harsh, when you think about when we first went into the UK, this was in 2019, retail was not in favor. Brexit has dominated the conversation and we were able to do deals that subsequent to us having done those deals, cap rates compressed to the tune of 70 basis points 80 basis points perhaps even more. And so we are going to be opportunistic. We are going to position ourselves and use our inherent competitive advantages to execute transactions where it makes sense. But yes, we will be very diligent and very selective. But we didn't enter Europe to shy away when things got rough. We believe the exact opposite that, it's going to be at times like this and what we believe will happen in Europe over the next 12 months that will create opportunities for us.
Harsh Hemnani: Great. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question will be from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi. Thank you. Just a point of clarification. So in terms of the $31 million and the outstanding receivables from Regal, is that all factored into your reserve of $33 million?
Christie Kelly: From the perspective of the reserves Linda, we took reserves on Regal as we had communicated of $23 million. And there, another $30 million of outstanding receivables associated with Regal to clarify.
Linda Tsai: Okay. But then your -- the reserves you have right now, for just tenants on your watch list are $33 million?
Christie Kelly: In terms of the total, we have for the watch list is $33 million, of which $23 million is Regal. And the remainder, as you would understand is primarily health and fitness.
Linda Tsai: Okay. Thank you. And then just in terms of the recapture rate, that was very strong the 108%, could you just talk about what's driving this overall? It's been strong pretty much all year.
Sumit Roy: Yes. Linda, I think it's a testament to the team. It's a testament to us controlling more assets for given operators. There is certainly, a drop of -- switching costs have gotten much higher for a lot of our clients. One of the things that we would compete with is the ability for our clients to basically say, I'm going to go and build the new asset down the road. And that's going to be a better outcome. But now, given the inflationary environment, given the construction costs, the switching cost hurdles have certainly crept up. And the fact that we do have 11,700 assets, we tend to control a lot more of the assets for a given client. And so, not talking about leverage, but we can have a much more holistic conversation with clients that not only take into account near-term resolutions but mid-term resolutions as well and come up with a win-win situation and therefore, be able to get the kind of re-leasing spreads that we have. Having said all of that, it is quite -- I'm very happy that we were able to do 108%, but it is -- I don’t want to view it as an outlier. But if you look at the history of the company since we've been reporting this, we've basically been right around 100%, 101% net of re-leasing spreads. So this on a proportionate basis is certainly higher, and I think it's a testament to the environment we find ourselves.
Linda Tsai: Do you think this continues for next year?
Sumit Roy: I think near term, you can expect us to continue to be in this particular ZIP code. The one thing that I will say that we are looking into is, especially in an environment like this, we will be a little bit more receptive to looking at clients. And, look, this is an analysis that we do across the portfolio, what is the best economic outcome. Renewing with an existing client based on the 5% increase, engaging with an existing client that is asking for a 10% reduction from where it's closing and then looking at the alternative of selling the assets and putting the proceeds to use in the current cap rate environment. Once we go through that decision tree and let's also throw in repositioning of the asset as a fourth variable, we decide what is the most favorable outcome. And so far, the outcome that -- for the last few years has been resulting in north of 103%, 104%, 105% of re-leasing spreads, but it is possible that it might revert back to 100% or 101%, because it is more favorable for us to keep an existing client, while taking a bit of a haircut. But over the next six to eight months, I still believe that we'll be north of 100% in terms of recapture rate.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Next question will be from Nick Joseph from Citi. Please, go ahead.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. Sumit, you talked about the volatility, obviously, in your shares, but also really across the space. And so, at this point, there're some diverging multiples in cost of capital. So hoping to get your thoughts on M&A broadly within the sector and then your appetite for it. 
Sumit Roy: Yes. Nick, if you can point to candidates who'd be willing to engage in conversations around M&A today, this can be a very interesting time to discuss that. But I suspect that a lot of the management team, Nick, would be very focused on trying to run their business trying to make sure that they emerge from this particular economic environment stronger, so that they can engage in M&A transactions. But theoretically speaking, M&A is something that one should absolutely consider, especially if it's a 100% stock deal and you don't have an over-reliance on the public markets on the debt side to help finance. And if your relative cost of capital is stronger, which in our case, under most circumstances, it is, and that is something that would be very attractive to us. It's just -- it'll be difficult and I'm just -- it's a hypothetical comment I'm making. It'd be difficult to see management teams of potential companies wanting to engage in that sort of discussion in this environment.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And I completely understand that it takes two there, but that's helpful. And then just -- I know we've talked a lot on cap rates. You called out the casino deal that is still expected to close later this year. I think you mentioned a 5.9% cap rate that was struck earlier. Where would that be struck today do you think? How much cap rate expansion would you expect kind of on the casino cycle?
Sumit Roy: Yes. You tell me, Nick. You cover all the gaming companies. And what I'm seeing is that, they've all gotten repriced. And I don't know if we did them the favor or what, but they're trading at levels that I don't know if there'll be a lot of movement from, where we entered into the win -- the Encore Boston Harbor asset. But, look, I still think that that is a wonderful asset. We underwrote it about a year ago now -- well, not quite, almost a year ago with a profile of about $210 million in EBITDA and it is already performing at a $250 million EBITDA and I still don't believe that it has fully stabilized, especially with gaming -- sports betting sorry being legalized. So I don't know if I would say to you Nick that that five nine would be dramatically different today, but we haven't seen an asset like that yet. So difficult for me to opine on that.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. And where do you think it closes?
Sumit Roy: We are hopeful and that's one of the things that we talked about on the earnings guidance. We are expecting to close in the fourth quarter. That remains our conviction. But really as to when in the fourth quarter remains a bit of a question mark, but we still believe that it will close in the fourth quarter. And I have a very high conviction on that front. 
Nick Joseph: Thank you very much.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question will be from John Massocca, Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.
John Massocca: Good afternoon.
Sumit Roy: Hi, John.
John Massocca: So just a quick one for me. It sounds like you were surprised by how kind of receptive cap rate environment has been to interest rate changes. Have you seen that kind of same receptiveness to maybe higher escalators particularly on retail transactions?
Sumit Roy: Yes, we have. It's still difficult here in the US to get untethered or uncapped CPIs, especially given the environment that we are in and retail tends to be a low-margin business, but there is far more receptivity to getting higher interest rate -- higher -- what do... 
Christie Kelly: Escalators.
Sumit Roy: Escalators. Thank you. Higher escalators in our leases today than it was perhaps 12 months ago. The same discussion on escalators in Europe, it is a lot more easier for us to engage and get CPI-type adjustments. And in fact, the Metro transaction that we talked about has CPI escalators built into the lease. And so I think those are easier in Europe than it is here, but we are starting to see the seller being more willing to give us higher escalators than what we have traditionally seen in this space.
John Massocca: In terms of the fixed escalators on kind of US investments, particularly retail, any kind of brackets on how much they've increased maybe versus last year or even pre-pandemic?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. John. Again, it's going to be a function of the type of retail. The higher-yielding stuff is going to tend to have higher elevation, higher escalators. The investment-grade guys -- it's still going to be tough. Maybe they'll be willing to give you fixed bumps every five years, which perhaps they wouldn't have 12 months ago. But I mean it's difficult for me to quantify the exact amount of increase in this environment. What I can tell you is we are seeing increases.
John Massocca: Understandable. That’s it for me. Thank you very much.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question will be from Chris Lucas, Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Sorry for the long call. Just two quick ones for me, Sumit you talked a little bit about or actually frequently about the Encore transaction. The question I have is just, are you just waiting for regulatory approval? And once that occurs, you can close immediately, or is there some other timing issue related to the close?
Sumit Roy: That is it Chris. It really is waiting on the regulators to give us a thumbs up. And once we have that, then we'll be in a position to close.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then Christie just a quick one for me. The -- I guess the other adjustments was about $0.04 a share, which is huge. Not a lot of detail there. Can you give me some color as to what that breakdown was, I know foreign exchange is a big one. I just don't know how much of it is?
Christie Kelly: Yeah. The other adjustments was really related on the income statement to non-cash oriented translation loss of about $20 million.
Chris Lucas: Great. Thank you. That’s all I have.
Christie Kelly: You're welcome.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sumit Roy for closing remarks. Please go ahead.
End of Q&A:
Sumit Roy: Thanks Nick. Thank you all for joining us today. We're looking forward to ending 2022 strong and in seeing many of you at the NAREIT conference in two weeks. Good evening.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-04 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon and good morning, and welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea Behr, Manager of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.
Andrea Behr: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income second quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Also joining us on our call is Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President-Corporate Finance, together with our One Team leaders. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that maybe considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company’s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Andrea. Welcome everyone. Cultivating strong and enduring relationships with all our stakeholders is foundational to the success of our business. And I'd like to thank everyone listening for your continued support. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation to all my Realty Income colleagues who continue make significant contributions towards our growth initiatives, while serving our clients and all stakeholders as one Realty Income team. We are pleased with the momentum across all areas of our business amidst an uncertain macro environment, which we believe once again, demonstrates the stability of our business model and its ability to thrive irrespective of the economic cycle. The strength of our global investment pipeline has allowed us to invest over $3.2 billion in high-quality real estate in the first half of the year, including approximately $1.7 billion during the second quarter. Given this momentum, we are increasing our 2022 acquisitions guidance to over $6 billion. On the topic of acquisitions, I'd like to mention two key developments that we are observing in the marketplace. First, as demonstrated by the weighted average 5.7% cash cap rate, we were able to achieve on our investments in the second quarter, cap rates are moving higher in our target markets. Our second quarter cap rate ticked higher compared to the 5.6% and 5.4% cap rates we achieved in the previous two quarters. The positive correlation between cap rates and interest rate is also evident in our acquisition pipeline. Second, as a corollary to rising debt and equity costs that have impacted much of our competition, the pipeline of acquisition opportunities materializing for us at accretive spreads continues to grow. As a reminder, we report our cap rates on a cash basis. On a straight line basis, we estimate our second quarter cap rate to be approximately 6.2%. And generally, the difference between cash and straight line cap rates ranges between 50 and 70 basis points in any given period. Transaction flow remains strong with sourcing volume totaling approximately $26 billion in this quarter, bringing year-to-date sourcing volume to approximately $60 billion. We remain selective as we have acquired approximately 5% of sourced volume year-to-date. During the second quarter as percentage of revenue, approximately 39% of acquisition volume was leased to investment-grade rated clients. We remain committed to our underwriting principles of partnering with well capitalized clients who are leaders in their respective industries. Our international investment volume continues to comprise a significant percentage of our total volume, representing 41% of global volume in the second quarter at a cash cap rate of approximately 5.8%. We are encouraged that our size, scale and access to well-priced capital provides us with the platform and currency to actively deploy capital as we build continued momentum heading into 2023. It was also an active quarter with regard to dispositions. We sold 70 properties, generating net sale proceeds of $150 million at an unlevered IRR of approximately 9.3%. Year-to-date, we have sold 104 properties with net sales proceeds totaling $272 million, generating an unlevered IRR of approximately 9.4%. Capital recycling continues to be a value accretive activity for us. And importantly, the unlevered returns we have been able to deliver speak to the attractive risk adjusted investment profile of our properties that have gone through our full investment cycle. Our diligent underwriting process, exposure to high-quality credit clients and the inherent quality of our real estate continue to deliver consistent performance. At the end of the second quarter, our occupancy was 98.9%, the highest occupancy rate we have achieved in over 10 years. Based on our current occupancy rates and client profile, we are increasing our year-end 2022 occupancy guidance to over 98%. During the second quarter, we re-leased 193 leases and achieved a rent recapture rate of 105.6%, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 105.9%. At quarter-end, 43.2% of our portfolios annualized contractual rent was generated from investment-grade rated clients. Further, our properties leased to clients on our portfolio watch list represents less than 4% of our portfolios analyze contractual rent, which is largely consistent with the low percentages we have seen so far this year. Finally, our same-store rental revenue increased 2% during the quarter and 3% year-to-date. With a continued strong operations performance of our portfolio, we are increasing our guidance for same-store rent growth to approximately 2% for 2022. At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter.
Christie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. During the second quarter, our business generated $0.97 of AFFO per share, representing 10.2% year-over-year growth. The growth engine of our Company revolves around accretive acquisitions. Our investment goals are supported by our well-capitalized balance sheet and favorable cost of capital, which remain competitive advantages for us in the net lease industry. We finished the quarter well within our target leverage ratios with net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDAR of 5.3 times or 5.2 times on a pro forma basis, giving annualized effects to net investment activity during the quarter. It was another active quarter for us on the capital raising front. As we issued approximately $1.8 billion of long-term and permanent capital, including nearly $1.1 billion of equity through our ATM program and a £600 million private placement note offering which priced at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.22% with a blended tenure of 10.5 years. As a result, we finished the quarter with approximately $1 billion of commercial paper and revolver borrowings net of cash. Our outstanding CPE and revolver borrowings essentially represent our only variable rate debt exposure across a total debt principal balance of almost $16 billion. As Sumit mentioned previously, our ability to access well-priced capital is a competitive advantage and we took steps during the quarter to further bolster this capacity. As previously announced in April this year, we recasted and upsized our multicurrency revolving credit facility from $3 billion to $4.25 billion. Subsequent to quarter-end, we upsized our U.S. Commercial Paper Program from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and established our Euro Commercial Paper Program with a capacity of $1.5 billion. The combined $3 billion Commercial Paper Programs for which our revolving credit facility serves as a liquidity backstop will give us the flexibility to efficiently finance our short-term funding needs at materially lower rates than comparable facility borrowings. Given the momentum we continue to see in our investment activities in Europe, the establishment of a Euro program was a strategic goal of ours this year. And it will serve as an efficient tool for us to take advantage of the comparably lower all-in commercial paper rates in the Euro market. With the health of our portfolio and investment progress achieved year-to-date, balanced alongside the timing of capital deployment and continued capital markets volatility, we affirm our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing nearly 9% annual growth at the mid-point. From a dividend perspective as the monthly dividend company, consistent quarterly increases in dividend reflects the confidence we have in the cash flow generated capacity of our business. In June, we increased our dividend for the 116th time in our company’s history. And last month, we declared our 625th consecutive common stock monthly dividend. From a sustainability perspective, further in June, we published our green bond allocation report, and I’m pleased to report that the net proceeds from our inaugural green bond offering have been fully allocated to eligible green projects in accordance with the criteria outlined in our green financing framework. From a merger perspective lastly, I am pleased to report that we have completed the integration of our VEREIT merger, which culminated in the conversion to a single ERP system for the combined entities during the second quarter. This could not have been accomplished so seamlessly without the commitment and dedication of our talented one team. And finally, we remain on track to achieve the expected $45 million to $55 million of annualized run rate cost energies we initially shared over a year ago when we announced the merger. And now, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. Coming off a record 2021 from an investment standpoint, I’m proud that our team has only accelerated the momentum this year. Most importantly, we believe the future is bright as our positioning to further gain market share in the investment arena grows. Indeed, the advantages afforded to us given our size scale and access to well priced capital have rarely been more pronounced than they are today. And we look forward to continuing to capitalize on this in the days ahead. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.
Michael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question.
Christie Kelly: Hi, Michael.
Michael Goldsmith: Hello, good. Thank you for taking my question. First question is on cap rates moving higher, the markets getting a little bit better. You have a larger acquisition team due to the VEREIT merger. How can you be a little bit more aggressive or take advantage of the improving markets, just given that combined with there are some uncertainties in kind of the borrowing markets as well.
Sumit Roy: That’s a good question, Michael, because there are competing variables in this market today. You’re absolutely right. That cap rates are moving in the right direction. There are adjusting a lot quicker than I had originally anticipated. We do have a much bigger team. And with the VEREIT merger, some of the team members that we have inherited, they are definitely producing and focusing on a certain area of the high real market that is actually resulting in transactions for us. The offset to that, however, is the capital market. Look, on a relative basis, we are doing very well. If you look at our tenure unsecured bond spreads, they have moved, I would say approximately 85 basis points. You look at our peers, our net lease peers with a BBB rating, it’s moved 120 basis points to 150 basis points. If you look at our cost of equity, it is essentially unchanged from the beginning of the year. But if you look at our net lease peers, they’ve dropped by about 1.8 times. So those are the positive momentums, but it is true also that our cost of capital overall has also increased. And the question really is around, can we generate the right spreads to move the needle on the overall AFFO per share growth? And the answer is yes. But as you know, there is an adjustment period, which is why we have increased our acquisition guidance to over $6 billion from over $5 billion as a testament to what we are seeing in terms of benefits accruing to us, based on some of what I just discussed. We are starting to see a lot more transactions coming back to us those that we were not willing to price at the levels that the sellers were expecting when they initially brought it to us, are now coming back with an adjusted cap rate, which works. It is also true that the overall team has been able to just source more and those are sort of shown in the sourcing volumes that, that we have shared with you of $60 billion year-to-date. But with interest rate movements and more importantly, the velocity at which these interest rates have moved, the spreads continue to be right around at 110 basis points, 111 basis points year-to-date, which is slightly below our overall average. So that’s the reason why that this positive momentum is being reflected in higher acquisition volume, but not necessarily translating into higher earnings guidance.
Michael Goldsmith: Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, European acquisitions were about 40% this quarter. And so that represents a bit of an acceleration from what we’ve seen. So is 40% kind of the right mix for next year or at least the second half into next year like how are you thinking about the U.S. versus Europe mix going forward?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Michael, it fluctuates. I mean there have been quarters actually where the international acquisition number has been not the 50% of the overall volume. And as we start to grow into newer markets, et cetera, obviously, the total addressable market continues to increase for us. And as we become much more mature in each one of these newer markets, the sourced volume as well as which translates to closed volume will increase. But I wouldn’t go so far as to say that, at this point in time, we should be thinking anything north of this 40% number 41% is what we achieved in the second quarter, as being it should be the guiding composition of the overall acquisition numbers going forward. There will be quarters where we’ll do more just like we’ve done in the past, but 40% seems to be the right number.
Michael Goldsmith: Thank you very much.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Mike.
Operator: The next question is from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Christie Kelly: Hi, Nick.
Nick Joseph: Thank you. Hi, how are you? You touched on cap rates obviously expanding a bit. Wondering if you could break that out between international versus the U.S. where you’ve seen more expansion, where you’ve seen more stickiness or any differences between the two.
Sumit Roy: Sure. That’s a great question, Nick, and welcome back to our space. I would say that the movement in cap rates here in the U.S. are certainly much more pronounced than what we have seen in the international markets. And it is largely a function of the Fed being a lot more aggressive than the ECB or the Bank of England have been. Having said that, we just saw an announcement earlier today that the Bank of England has moved its interest rates 50 basis points. So we do see that translating to higher cap rates in the UK as well as in the rest of Continental Europe. So just to quantify some of these movements, I would say that depending on the product, and when I say retail, you can go from groceries, which have moved the most because they had become the most aggressive, they’ve moved up about a 100 basis points to some of the other industries that we focus on within the retail space, I would quantify that movement is being right around 25 basis points to 50 basis points. And you should start to see that being reflected in the subsequent quarters and the acquisition cap rates – cash cap rates that we are going to share with the market going forward. In the – in Europe, we have also seen movement, but it hasn’t been quite as pronounced maybe 5 basis points to 10 basis points. On the industrial side, the movement has been a bit more visible 25 basis points to 50 basis points, similar to what we experienced here in the U.S. But I would say the industrial market has continued to see an expansion on cap rates. And I would say, from beginning to end, maybe you circa 50 basis points of movement on average. Now, obviously, there are certain markets where the movement has been a lot, lot less than that Inland Empire comes to mind. But the more secondary tertiary markets, you have seen a more pronounced movement than it could be even north of 50 to 75 basis.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. That's very helpful. And then you mentioned deals coming back, do those fall out of contract, did they – did the seller just not get the pricing? What are you see broadly as those – as you get a second crack at some of them?
Sumit Roy: Yes. It's largely buyers that rely on the debt capital markets either the CMBS market or the bank loan market. You are in New York, you know what the money market, the big banks, the BofAs, the JPMorgans, the Wells, I'm not going to say that they have a moratorium on new loans, but it is much more difficult for them to create new bank debt or increased revolvers, et cetera, for more distress credit. So the overall debt market has sort of become a lot more expensive for some of these levered buyers. And that's what we've seen is that they're no longer being able to honor the original cap rates that transactions were being struck at. And of course, we chose not to pursue those transactions at those given pricing. And so when they do come back to us and as long as we like the transaction, it was just a pricing discussion. We are being able to now, either honor the cap rate that we had or even expand out those cap rates to reflect current market conditions. But the fact that the surety of close has become so much more important for the sellers today is clearly prevalent in a lot of the discussions that we are having with the sellers today.
Nick Joseph: Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: The next question is from Connor Siversky with Berenberg. Please go ahead.
Christie Kelly: Hi, Connor.
Connor Siversky: Thanks for having me on the call. I'm curious on this cap rate discussion, and I'm appreciate your comments that you have a correlation between rising rates and subsequent impact on cap rates. But I'm wondering if you've ever been able to establish what the lag looks like. For example, with a 25 basis point increase in rates, how long does it take for that to reflect in cap rates? And then second to that, are you seeing that relationship accelerate, given that you are seeing some of these lending partners shut down their operations?
Sumit Roy: Yes, it's a great question. And unfortunately, if we were in a lab where we could control all variables that sort of drive this correlation, it would be a lot easier of an answer to give you. Historically, when we've done these correlations, we have found that the lag to be anywhere between nine to perhaps even as long as 12 months. I was a lot more skeptical coming into this particular situation coming into this year and seeing the rising interest rate environment. Just because of the – the sheer volume of capital that has come into our space on the institutional side. And I was a bit hesitant to continue to say, hey, it's going to be this nine to 12 month lag before cap rates start to reflect the new environment, because of this wealth of capital. However, what I didn't take into account was the debt markets adjusting as quickly as they did. And even this new capital that has come into our space, both on the private equity side, as well as on the public side of the equation. The debt markets adjusted a lot faster. And therefore the pullback from these newer buyers in our space has been a lot more acute, which has resulted in cap rates adjusting a lot faster. I mean, we've had a rising interest rate environment now for the last six months. And we are already starting to see cap rates adjust 25 to 50 basis points. And like I said, in the grocery sector, we saw sale leasebacks being done in the low fours that are now coming back and being done in the low fives to mid fives. So it's not a constant Connor that I can point to. It is a reflection of the environment that you're faced with, but it's a good thing for us truth be told that cap rates can adjust, as quickly as they have in a rising interest rate environment. I just hope that the corollary is not true.
Connor Siversky: Got it. That's a very interesting color. I'll leave it there. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Christie Kelly: Hi, Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, there. Hello, everyone. So I guess, I'm curious on your assessment of the non-high grade portion of the market right now. Curious, I understand, it's not a focus of yours, but you do dabble and do have exposure there. Curious, of the relative attractiveness of high grade versus perhaps non-high grade and if there was a scenario perhaps enough premium of a return to perhaps make you do a bit more on the non-high grade side. Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Hi, Haendel. Yes. This is a narrative that continues to be out there that we are not focused or that we are disproportionately focused on the high grade side of the equation. Just look at what we did this quarter. I mean, 62% of what we did was sub-investment grade or non-rated. So it is – I don't believe true to say that all we focus on is investment grade credit and that particular product. What we have tried to share with the market clearly unsuccessfully. So that we focus on risk adjusted returns that are points in time where the risk adjusted returns on investment grade credit is far superior to what we were seeing on the non-investment grade side. And we pivot there and we try to do those transactions. And then there are other times where the exact opposite is true, where sub-investment grade is allowing you to capture risk adjusted returns that are far superior. And so we find ourselves in that period today, where we are finding very good opportunities on the non-investment grade side of the equation, and as such are being able to get a lot of those transactions over the finish line, i.e., 62% in the second quarter. So we are indifferent to the credit ratings. What we focus on is looking at the totality of that particular opportunity to then ascribe a return profile that makes sense for the risk that we are undertaking. And that will continue to vary. We don't target investment grade. Investment grade tends to be a byproduct of the underwriting. So hopefully that clarifies the question you asked.
Haendel St. Juste: Sure, sure. Certainly appreciate the color, the perspective. Any update with Encore still on track to close I believe in fourth quarter, how's the regulatory and licensing coming along.
Sumit Roy: Still on track, we are quite optimistic. We've continued to stay very close to the MGC. We are working very closely with them, so we are very optimistic that it'll close by the end of this year in the fourth quarter.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: The next question is from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Christie Kelly: Hey, Brad.
Brad Heffern: Hey, everyone. Hi, Christie. One for you, I guess. On the new guidance, can you just talk about the moving pieces that kept the AFFO per share number unchanged despite the higher acquisition total? I assume it said potentially tighter spreads versus the cost of capital, but I'm curious if there was a FX impact or a interest expense impact or anything else.
Christie Kelly: Yes. I think, Brad, just to start off Sumit – Sumit had started to touch on this in terms of some of the moving pieces given the fact that we had increase our acquisition volume to over $6 billion, but kept as you observed in our AFFO per share guidance the same and reaffirmed it. And there are some factors there in terms of first, the volatility in the capital markets as we've discussed, the overall rate hikes and the magnitude of those hikes and any future actions that may be taken. Both in terms of the European and U.S. environments. We also to the point that you were making. We do actually hedge from the perspective of FX to protect our international income as well as we’ve got hedges in place to lower our effective interest rates, and we’ll touch on that a bit more in a second. But the other thing too is that just the general timing of the investment volume, the team has just been doing a great job. We’ve got really strong momentum as Sumit discussed in the market. And the acquisitions that we close from now towards the end of the year, while our attractive are really going to be setting us up nicely for 2023. So the timing of that isn’t as beneficial for the year in AFFO as it will be for the full year impact next year. And I think, to the upside, we still have some clients on cash accounting, that have just started under their deferral arrangements. And so we’ll be monitoring them for continued consistent payment performance, and make the appropriate calls and alignment with our policy and guidelines when we may be taking them off of cash accounting. But I’d love to turn it over to Jonathan to talk a little bit more specifically about hedging and the impact.
Jonathan Pong: Thanks, Christie. Yes, Brad, you’ve seen us obviously issue a lot of local currency debt in the sterling market that’s intentional, obviously, much lower haul in rates there. But certainly, from a natural hedge perspective, having interest expense denominated in the same currency where we’re now getting rent limits the exposure that we have in volatility. And then we have a cleanup methodology where we hedge a portion of AFFO that is unhedged. And so from that dynamic, we feel like we’ve mitigated the range of outcomes, upside and downside, but there is still some unhedged exposure, about 60% of our foreign-denominated AFFO is unhedged. So for every 10% move in the dollar, for instance, you’re looking at maybe $0.015 of volatility on an annualized basis. So, we’re not completely hedged, which can lead to upside if we see some mean reversion here in the dollar. But just a little bit of conservatism that we’re taking here sitting here in August.
Brad Heffern: Okay. I appreciate all the color. And then, Sumit, some of your peers this quarter have talked about portfolios trading at a discount to single assets. Is that something that you’ve seen? And are you interested potentially in pursuing more portfolio deals?
Sumit Roy: No more than in the past, Brad. Portfolio deals generally do tend to trade at a discount, especially in times like this when the cost of capital have gone up. And a lot of these potential buyers of big portfolios are sort of sitting on the sidelines. So this is essentially reverted back to where it was, where we would get a discount on portfolio transactions. And so if you look at our volume today, about 62% of what we did were portfolio transactions. So that actually accrues to our benefit, Brad, and we are certainly seeing exactly the same scenario as some of our peers have commented.
Brad Heffern: Okay, thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: The next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hi, everyone.
Christie Kelly: Hi, Wes.
Wes Golladay: Hey there. I got a question also maybe on the FX, more so on the future hedging, I guess. As you buy more properties overseas, would you do more, I guess, CP issuance tip for the hedging? And could we see the U.S. issuance of CP maybe go down to zero and unusual full capacity overseas?
Jonathan Pong: Hey, Wes, it’s Jonathan. I’ll take that one. You may have seen our euro commercial paper program establishment recently, $1.5 billion equivalent together with the upsizing of our U.S. dollar commercial paper program. Focusing on the Euro CP side, we absolutely intend to utilize that to the extent that we have a use of euro currency. But right now, obviously, interest rates are much lower comparatively. We could probably issue one year year-old CP [ph] in a 25 basis point context and that compares to revolver borrowings that are 75 basis points or so. So certainly, having a liability and a very cheap liability at that denominated in euros will be additive on all fronts, limiting the amount of derivatives that we have to engage with to hedge our exposure and lowering the old interest rate that we have to pay on your borrowings.
Wes Golladay: Got it. And then want to go back to the comment, sorry, go ahead.
Sumit Roy: Yes, Wes, having said all of that, we will be leaning towards permanently financing our acquisitions as soon as possible. I mean this is really a mechanism for us to provide the surety to the market and take advantage of our A-/A3 rating. But this will continue to not dominate our overall debt profile. If you look at what our outstandings are today, it’s about 7%. And that is how you should think about us running up business going forward.
Wes Golladay: Got it. Then I want to go back to that comment about why do you need cap rates. I’m just curious if you’re seeing any difference between sale leasebacks, marketed assets, developer takeouts, any of your channels that you look at?
Sumit Roy: Yes. It’s not a function of the channel. I would say, Wes, it is much more a function of the overall market. If you are starting to see cap rates move in portfolio transactions, whether the portfolio comes from another seller or from a sale-leaseback avenue it’s going to be reflective of markets. Does relationship play a hand? Sure, it does. But those are 5 basis points to 10 basis points to maybe 15 basis points at best. But it is really the market that dictates what those cap rates are going to be, not so much the channels.
Wes Golladay: Great, thanks a lot.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Christie Kelly: Hi, Josh.
Joshua Dennerlein: Hey Christie, hey, guys. So now that you’ve kind of completed the integration of the VEREIT merger, what – how are you guys thinking about additional M&A?
Sumit Roy: Josh, we won’t let us breathe, will you?
Joshua Dennerlein: You guys go to work hard. I mean, especially Jonathan, he got to work extra hard.
Sumit Roy: That’s true. That’s true. Josh, we’ve always said that, look, as far as M&A is concerned, we are always open for opportunities. But it is not easy to facilitate an M&A trade. You need willing partners, you need the market environment to be conducive, you need to be able to look at the other portfolio to figure out, is there a massive amount of overlap in terms of strategically what we would have gone after had this entire portfolio been available. You then have to take into consideration social issues. There are so many things that sort of have to align before you can help facilitate an M&A trade. But having said all of that, and this is very consistent with what we’ve said in the past, we are always looking. And if the right opportunity presents itself, we’re not going to shy away from it. So, we’ve shown that we can do it. We’ve done it a couple of times now. And we’ll keep looking and keep working hard, like you said, Josh.
Joshua Dennerlein: And then I think you mentioned grocery anchors. It sounds like the cap rates moved like 100 basis points higher. Were there any other asset classes or property types where you’re seeing that kind of magnitude of a move?
Sumit Roy: Yes. The industrial, I would say, not across the board, but some industrial, the movement has been quite pronounced as well, don’t know if it’s 100 basis points, but it wouldn’t be far to say, 50 basis points to 75 basis points. I just felt like the grocery market decelerated, i.e. the compression of the cap rates was so immediate from where we used to buy grocery here in the U.S., in the high-5s, this was the best-in-class grocery it accelerated down to the low-4s. And this was absolutely a testament to the amount of capital that had come into our space and the cost of debt available that allow these buyers to essentially hit the yield that they required on a cash-on-cash basis. And the unwinding was as quick, partially driven by what the Fed chose to do, partially driven by how that translated into the debt market. And then the withdrawal of some of this capital that relied on the debt markets. So, I think that phenomena is very unique to that particular sector of retail. And we didn’t see that compression in any other sector that I can think of.
Joshua Dennerlein: Interesting. Thanks guys.
Operator: The next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey, just a couple of quick ones staying on, maybe not..
Christie Kelly: Hey, Ronald.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey, how are you? Just staying on the theme of large acquisitions, maybe M&A, but just even just bigger portfolio deals. I remember one of the benefits of sort of having a larger platform is being able to do these larger sale leasebacks, just any update on how that pipeline is building. And when can we see sort of more of those deals come through?
Sumit Roy: Yeah, Ron I'll tell you the pipelines is big. And we are in discussions on fairly sizable opportunities. Again, similar to my comments with regards to M&A, I think it's difficult, sellers are still a bit anchored on the past in terms of where the market was literally five to six months ago, and their willingness to sort of recognize the current state of affairs is what's going to dictate as to whether these conversations and these pipeline opportunities translate to under contract opportunities. But I can tell you, Ron, that our pipeline has never looked stronger and a lot of that makeup is from bigger portfolio transactions. And so we are hopeful that a few of these will get over the finish line, and if it does, you'll be the first to know.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And if I could just ask one quick one on the guidance, just what's the assumption for – and sorry if you covered this already, what's the assumption for bad debt and that change at all, because it seems like that's been pretty low?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. Jonathan or Christie should take that.
Christie Kelly: Yeah. In terms of we're on a bad debt. Yeah. There was no specific change as it relates to bad debt. And in terms of the impact, for example, we've talked a lot about the clients that we still have on cash accounting and the fact that the deferral arrangements for a good approximately handful of those that were primarily impacted during COVID in the theater and health and fitness space. Their deferral arrangements started in July. And so we will be looking at their continued strong collections performance and make the appropriate calls in relation to our policies and things as we continue through this year and determine if we will be taking any of those clients off of cash accounting. And some of that impact Ron, is also one of the variables that we factored in as it relates to the upper end of our guidance.
Ronald Kamdem: Thank you.
Jonathan Pong: Ron, I'll just add, in terms of the remainder of the year guidance we're really looking at more of a normalized assumption. So, the first half of the year we've actually benefited from some paybacks on deferral agreements that have actually resulted in flat or even negative bad debt expense. So a little bit of conservatism in back half of the year, just given the macro environment and uncertainties. But definitely assuming just a normalized run rate in a pre-pandemic year.
Ronald Kamdem: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.
John Massocca: Good afternoon.
Christie Kelly: Hi John.
John Massocca: How's it going? So as we think about the competitive environment you face in the Europe versus the U.S., I mean, how sensitive are your European competitors to rising rates? And I guess if we can see continued upper pressure on UK and EU rates, could it push certain competitors out of the market kind of similar to what you've seen in the U.S. year-to-date?
Sumit Roy: Absolutely. not trying to be flipping to John, but that is exactly what we expect to see happen. I think I mentioned that the BFA has just raised their interest rates by 50 basis points to 1.75%[ph]. We should start to see the cap rates adjust, but a lot of the levered buyers and those happen to be quite a few there. We will start to fall by the wayside. We've already seen that on a few transactions that we've been pursuing in the international markets. And again, this certainty of close is what gets amplified at times like this. And we've had transactions that literally have come back to us in the international markets, because they recognize our ability to close on especially large transactions. And so I expect, what we are seeing happen here in the U.S., a similar storyline to play out in the international markets and given that the level of competition that we face there, John is actually a lot less. We expect those advantages to be even more enhanced in quarters to come.
John Massocca: And I guess maybe if we think back to kind of 3Q and 4Q of last year, I mean, how important was the non-public levered buyer in the European markets versus the U.S.? Is it kind of a bigger portion of the competitive set or is it equal less?
Sumit Roy: Yeah, that's very difficult to quantify, but if I had to guess, I would say that there are more of the buyers in Europe that rely on the debt markets. And what makes it challenging is that the debt markets are potentially not quite as mature as we have here in the U.S., the circa few fewer people that we were competing with for the kind of product that we've been pursuing. And this is consistent with one of our strategic reasons to expand into Europe is the lack of similar kinds of competition that we see here in the U.S. and more of an amplification of our inherent advantages in that particular market. And we are certainly starting to see that more so recently.
John Massocca: Okay. And I know it's a relatively recent phenomenon, but as you think about tenant credit, both with acquisitions and the in-place portfolio, how are you thinking about sellers of kind of hard goods versus more services-oriented tenants, given some of the recent shifts in consumer demand?
Sumit Roy: Yeah, it does depend on the type of hard goods. I will tell you, Walmart just came out with another announcement today. They're getting pressured. But do I see Walmart struggling to pay their rent? I don't. Do I see now, if you were to look at categories, do I see apparel companies suffering a little bit more, especially if discretionary income continues to get pressured? Absolutely. Do I see quick service restaurants suffering the same? I don't. We saw this play out in the great financial crisis where some of the service oriented businesses actually thrived. The movie theater business did very well. The health and fitness business did quite well because, especially the lower cost health and fitness concepts, because they tend to attract the more value sensitive consumer base at times where alternatives have become a lot more expensive. I do expect, casual dining to feel a little bit more of the pressure. But again, the concepts are important who the operator is important, their balance sheet strength, their ability to take lessons learned from the pandemic where there were a lot more click and collects and deliveries that they were able to pivot to in terms of their business model. Those I think will hold them in good stead for the ones that survived and were able to institute those types of changes to their business model. But it's very much specific to the particular vertical and the environment we find ourselves in.
John Massocca: Very helpful color. That's it for me. Thank you very much.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, John.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Lucas with Capital One. Please go ahead.
Christie Kelly: Hi there, Chris.
Chris Lucas: Good afternoon. Hi, Christy. Good afternoon, everybody. Just a follow-up question on the commercial paper program. I guess, I'm just thinking about it so you've got $1.5 billion denominated in €1.5 billion denominated. Was there a specific reason why euro denominated rather than pound denominated related to efficiency, depth of market future uses? Just trying to understand why euro and not pound?
Christie Kelly: Sure. Chris.
Jonathan Pong: Hey Chris, it's Jonathan, you know, there's a nuance in the commercial paper market. The storage market is really not that big. So you don't really see a lot of stand-alone sterling programs. The Eurocommercial paper program does give us the flexibility to issue in sterling. And so to the extent there is demand in that market, we'll be able to tap into it. But by and large, this market is dominated by dollars and euros.
Chris Lucas: Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And then Sumit, just kind of taking a step back, sort of talk a little bit around the foreign exchange issue that's occurred this year. You've seen a pretty meaningful move in both in terms of the dollar appreciation relative to the euro and the pound. And if you kind of look historically back at this other than really like a week during COVID in March of 2020, you have to go all the way back to the Reagan [ph] Administration decline sort of this relative value on both the pound and on the, on the euro impact that far, but in terms of the dollar strength. So my question is, does that impact at all your view about where to allocate capital at this point? Or are you completely agnostic to the exchange rate?
Sumit Roy: It would be unfair to say, Chris, that we are agnostic to the exchange rate. Obviously, this is something that we have an acute focus on – like we said, we are not 100% hedged. That wouldn't be economically prudent to do so. We are about 40% hedged on our income stream. And we have instituted strategies to sort of mitigate fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. Having said all of that, we did exactly the same analysis, Chris, to figure out at which point in time where these exchange rates at current levels and concluded the same that look, again, I might look foolish in three months from now. But this looks like the low point in terms of foreign exchange between the GBP and the U.S. and the euro in the U.S. And you're starting to see with increases in interest rates by the Bank of England, similar to the ECB, you're starting to see that correct itself and start to revert a little bit more to the mean. So that could potentially act as a tailwind. But not knowing and not trying to take a forecast on where these things are going to play out. That's the reason – one of the main reasons why we kept our range exactly the same, but we believe that we are very well situated currently. Ultimately, this is a long game. And what we want is to let the product and the acquisition opportunities dictate with is with an eye on the exchange rate, dictate how we build out our portfolio. So totally not fair to say we would be agnostic, but it is something we keep in mind, but doesn't necessarily drive our strategy in its entirety.
Chris Lucas: Great. That’s helpful. That’s all I have this afternoon. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Chris.
Christie Kelly: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: The next question is from Harsh Hemnani with Green Street. Please go ahead.
Christie Kelly: Hi, Harsh.
Harsh Hemnani: Hey, Christie. A quick one for me. When you think about the investments in Europe, what percentage of them are sale-leaseback originations versus acquisitions of existing leases? And how does that compare to your investments in the U.S.?
Sumit Roy: I don't think that there is a major difference between the compositions. If you look at what we did on the sale leaseback side, Harsh, it was right around 28% year-to-date. And we've had quarters where it's been as high as 75% and we've had quarters where it's been as low as 20%. And so it really is a function of what's available, when is it closing in a given quarter, et cetera, that dictates the sale-leaseback piece. Having said that, I think when we do decide to pursue sale leasebacks in a meaningful way. It is possible that some of those transactions would be much larger in size. For instance, if you think about our inaugural transaction that we did when we first went into the U.K., it was a sale-leaseback that we did with Sainsbury's. That was $0.5 billion. If you think about the gaming industry and the sale leaseback we've done with them, it's going to dominate that particular quarter because it's a $1.7 billion transaction. And we see similar types of opportunities where when and if those close in a given quarter, it's going to dominate that particular quarter. And I don't think it's unique just to the U.S. I think it will be consistent between the U.S. and the international markets.
Harsh Hemnani: Okay, thank you.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Linda Tsai: Hi.
Christie Kelly: Hi, Linda.
Linda Tsai: Hi Christie. In terms of the 2% growth in same-store revenue, I saw health and fitness and restaurants and materially theaters contributed to the positive change in second quarter same-store. When did the strong comps start to normalize? And is that partly dependent on cash basis payback?
Sumit Roy: It is. It's when we start to sort of take a lot of these clients off of the cash basis and get them back on accrual basis. You're still going to have a period of about 12 months where there's going to be this mismatch. And some of these higher, same-store rental growth that you're seeing is essentially a byproduct of moving some of these cash accounts back to accrual account. And once all of this normalizes, you should expect us to be back in that 1% to 1.5% same-store growth. But right now, it's a period where we are now starting to recognize and move some of these clients and case in point AMC back to accrual accounting, and that's disproportionately impacting the growth rate in a very favorable way.
Linda Tsai: That's helpful. And then I think previously, you talked about putting some money into vacant properties to redevelop to help releasing prospects. Is this something you're still pursuing?
Sumit Roy: Very much so, Linda. And I think that is being captured in some of our re-leasing spreads that we've – that I'm so proud of the asset management team, over 105% essentially net with zero TI dollars. A lot of that – not a lot, but some of it is certainly driven by our repositioning. One of the highest recapture percentages that we had was taking a quick service concept and converting it into an alternative retail concept largely driven by a predictive analytics tool, saying that the best and use for this particular location is not a quick service restaurant, but this alternative concept. And we went down that path and we're able to recognize north of 200% in terms of recapture rates. And we share all of that information in aggregation with you on our supplemental so you can track some of that. But that is absolutely very much a focus of ours, Linda, and we hope that, that will continue to be – become a bigger and bigger portion of the value driver of our growth going forward.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today. I hope everyone enjoys the rest of the summer, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-05 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is David and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I’d like to welcome everyone to Realty Income’s First Quarter 2022 Operating Results Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Julie Hasselwander, Senior Manager of Investor Relations at Realty Income, you may begin your conference.
Julie Hasselwander: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income’s first quarter 2022 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that maybe considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company’s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Julie. Welcome everyone. 2022 is off to a strong start, and we are continuing to build momentum in our business. I want to express my deep appreciation of our One Team whose dedication and collaboration showcased the strength of our team through a timely closing of the first quarter, while integrating new processes and systems following the close of the VEREIT merger last November. All integration efforts are progressing and we remain committed to delivering continued scalability. We continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives and partnerships with our clients. In April, we published our second annual sustainability report, which details our commitments, goals and progress on our ESG efforts. I welcome all Realty Income stakeholders to share in our dedication to build sustainable relationships for the benefit of those we serve and encourage everyone listening to read through our 2021 sustainability report, which can be found in the Corporate Responsibility page of our website. Looking at macro trends, inflation persists as an important topic on the minds of many stakeholders and I want to emphasize that we believe our business is by design well-positioned to drive value in this climate. Our business model is one that generates significant recurring revenue that flows through to the bottom line. As a triple net lease REIT, our business is insulated from inflation. Our clients are responsible for covering taxes, insurance and other operating expenses. And as prices increase, many of our clients pass the incremental cost burden on to their consumers or suppliers. The efficiency of our model is reflected in our adjusted EBITDA margin, which is routinely around 94%. Maintaining a conservative capital structure has been a key tenet of our business since our founding and having a well-staggered fixed rate debt maturity schedule with no corporate bond maturities until 2024 limits on debt refinancing risk in a rising rate environment. In summary, we believe the appeal of our consistent and predictable stream of cash flows is amplified during periods of volatility like we find ourselves in today. To that end, we look at the last period in which the Federal Reserve increased interest rates from December 2015 through 2018 as a helpful case study. During this period, Realty Income’s total return outperformed the S&P 500 and the MSCI U.S. REIT Index both in year 1 of the rate hike cycle and throughout the 3-year duration of that cycle. And during the Great Recession, Realty Income exhibited less operational and financial volatility as compared to many other S&P 500 REITs that carry A credit ratings. From an organic growth standpoint, our asset management team continues to report impressive recapture rates. This quarter, we recaptured over 106% of rental revenue on expiring leases. Given our lease expiration schedule and proven rent recapture track record, we believe we are well-positioned to manage through an inflationary environment. Through 2024, nearly 12% of our portfolio annualized contractual rent is set to expire. And in this regard, inflation could serve as a tailwind to our business as rents and costs to build rise. On the acquisition front, our transaction flow remains strong. Certain categories of the market, has seen discernible increase in cap rates, which we believe should accrue to our advantage as a net acquirer. Historically, we have observed that when interest rates increase, cap rates are just following a lag period of 6 to 12 months. Much of this cap rate expansion can be attributed to levered buyers who have relied upon record low debt pricing to underwrite their returns. Given the current yield environment, we are in a comparatively strong position given our financing strategy. And as such, we would expect our competitive standing to strengthen further. Now, turning to the results for the quarter, our size and scale, in conjunction with strong relationships we have across the marketplace, continue to provide benefits through robust sourcing and acquisition volumes. This quarter, we sourced over $34 billion of acquisition opportunities. And approximately 40% of this amount was sourced from international markets. Our total property level acquisitions for the quarter, was approximately $1.6 billion. Approximately half of our volume in the first quarter was the result of international investments, bringing our total international portfolio to approximately $5 billion of invested capital. As we announced in February, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Encore Boston Harbor Resort and Casino leased to Wynn Resorts under a 30-year triple net lease with favorable annual rent increases. The $1.7 billion transaction includes more than 3.1 million square feet of high-quality real estate less than 5 miles from Downtown Boston. Pending regulatory procedures, we continue to anticipate this transaction closing during the fourth quarter of 2022. We believe the market is efficient. And while cap rates have stabilized, significant competition remains with the high-quality assets we pursue. Our average initial cash cap rate for the quarter was 5.6%, which reflects the quality of locations and clients we are adding to our portfolio. As a reminder, we report our cap rates on a cash basis. We estimate the difference between cash and straight line cap rates to be approximately an additional 70 basis points in the first quarter. The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 12.3 years and the top industry invested during the quarter was grocery stores. We continue to have access to attractively priced capital, which has allowed us to maintain healthy spreads on our investments even as interest rates rise. We are pleased with the continued strength of our core operations. We ended the quarter with our portfolio at 98.6% occupancy based on property count. The weighted average remaining lease term of our overall portfolio is approximately 8.9 years, which as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we see as an advantage. As leases roll, we continue to favorably recapture rent as a result of diligent underwriting and the inherent quality of our real estate enhanced by the proactive efforts of our experienced asset management team. This quarter, we re-leased 119 leases, recapturing 106.2% of expiring rent. And since our public listing in 1994, we have executed 4,260 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 101% of rent on those re-leased contracts. We continue to report our quarterly recapture rates, because we believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry. During the quarter, we sold 34 properties, generating net proceeds of approximately $122 million. Approximately, 84% of the sales volume during the quarter related to former VEREIT properties that were sold rated. And our portfolio delivered healthy same-store rent growth increasing 4.1% during the quarter. This was largely attributed to the reversal of $9.4 million of rental revenue reserves during the quarter within the same store pool compared to a reserve of $8 million recognized for the same pool during the year ago period. Excluding the impact of reserves in both periods, we estimate that our same-store rent growth would have been approximately 1.2%. At this time, I will pass it over to Christie who will further discuss results from the quarter.
Christie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. During the first quarter, our business generated AFFO per share of $0.98 supported by a strong acquisition pace and a healthy portfolio. As Sumit mentioned, during the quarter, we recognized a $9.4 million reversal of non-straight line rental revenue reserves. This was primarily driven by the $7.7 million reversal of our outstanding reserves related to AMC, reflecting the recovery from the pandemic. Given the performance of our One Team, the health of our portfolio and progress achieved during the first quarter of 2022, we reaffirm our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing 8.8% annual growth at the midpoint. From a leverage standpoint, we ended the quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAR of 5.4x in line with our target leverage ratios. And our near-term debt maturities remain minimal with a well-staggered predominantly fixed rate debt maturity schedule and no corporate bond maturities until 2024. As Sumit mentioned in his opening remarks, our modest debt maturity schedule through the end of next year limits our refinancing risk in a raising rate environment. Our size and scale provide us access to attractively price debt across several markets. For example, in January, we issued £500 million in sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes, pricing 5-year and 20-year notes at a blended all-in yield of 2.28% with a weighted average term of 12.5 years. During the quarter, we issued over $660 million of equity primarily through our ATM program. And subsequent to the quarter end, we entered into a definitive agreement for the private placement of a £600 million sterling-denominated offering of senior unsecured notes, pricing 8-year, 10-year and 15-year notes at a weighted average fixed rate of 3.22%, with a weighted average tenor of approximately 10.5 years. We greatly appreciate the support from the investors who have participated in our capital markets transactions. Finally, just last week, we announced the recast and upsizing of our credit facility, which now includes a $4.25 billion multicurrency revolving line of credit with an initial maturity in June 2026 and two 6-month extension options as well as a $1 billion accordion feature. At our current credit rating, the new revolving line of credit provides a borrowing rate of adjusted SOFR plus 72.5 basis points as compared to our previous credit facility of LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points. In total, 25 lenders participated in our recast and we greatly appreciate the support of our relationship banks, many of whom have supported us for decades and have been integral towards our growth. We have been most active during the last 12 months within corporate finance and capital markets. I’d like to make special mention of Jonathan Pong and his team who have worked tirelessly to bring our corporate financing strategies and capital markets execution together with our partners to fruition on behalf of all whom we serve. Realty Income was founded on the principles of income generation and capital preservation. We remain committed to delivering monthly dividends that increase over time as part of a consistently attractive total shareholder return proposition. In March, we celebrated the payment of our 620th monthly dividend by virtually bringing the New York Stock Exchange closing bell. At Realty Income, the dividend is sacrosanct and we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. And the value of our business is largely tied to current income as a recurring cash flow vehicle. As a result, the value proposition of owning Realty Income is comparatively more attractive during inflationary periods versus those whose value is tied to growth in future years. And now, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. Our business continues to perform and we are well-positioned to build on our momentum throughout 2022 and beyond. These are interesting times and I remain encouraged by our One Team’s creativity and work effort. We remain steadfast in our pursuit of providing our stakeholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long-term. Thank you again to our team and partners for helping us deliver these results and to our stakeholders for their continued support. With that, I’d like to open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Brad Heffern: Hey, everyone.
Christie Kelly: Hi, Brad.
Brad Heffern: Hi, Christie. Sumit, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have seen an increase in cap rates in certain categories. Can you give more color there and are there differences by credit quality or geography?
Sumit Roy: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Brad. Good question. I think the most obvious difference in cap rates – increasing cap rates we see is in the industrial sector and more so here in the U.S. than in the international markets. I would say if I was asked to quantify what this change is in terms of what we were seeing in the third and fourth quarter of last year to what we started to see in the first quarter and beyond of this year, I would say it’s in the tune of 25 to 50 basis points of increase in cap rates on the industrial sector. We are also starting to see on the retail side some of the transactions that were struck again in the fourth quarter of last year with potential levered buyers coming back. And certainty of close is taking on paramount importance with regards to the sellers and they are coming back at slightly higher cap rates. We see this more on the larger dollar retail acquisition opportunities, not so much on the QSR and smaller opportunities. But we are starting to see movement higher on the retail side, but it is not as dominant and it’s not as widespread as we see it on the industrial side.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you for that. And then are you seeing any companies that potentially wouldn’t have been interested in sale leaseback in the past come in just given the higher cost of alternative forms of financing?
Sumit Roy: Yes. I think part of it is that sale leaseback may potentially be a better avenue to raise capital and monetize their real estate, but I think part of it is also the maturation of the sale leaseback market, especially here in the U.S. We are starting to see first time operators engaging in sale leaseback conversations and a lot of it is not necessarily being generated by activist investors coming into play. A lot of it is organic. This is becoming part of their balance sheet management strategy going forward. And some of these are much larger than what we have typically seen in years past. And when I say that, I mean with $1 billion in front rather than $1 million. And to us, it is a function of the maturation of the sale leaseback market and of course, also what is happening on the CMBS and secured debt markets today.
Brad Heffern: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Sure. Next, we will go to Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Your line is open.
Christie Kelly: Hi, Greg.
Sumit Roy: Greg, you maybe on mute.
Operator: Yes, Greg. Your line is open.
Greg McGinniss: I certainly was. Thank you so much, Sumit. So, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Christie, the line of credit can now support a pretty significant level of acquisition activity. Just curious how you are thinking about maybe debt raises through the balance of the year, where do you anticipate you could raise debt and then thoughts on sterling and euro debt versus dollar debt at this point?
Christie Kelly: Yes. Thanks for that, Greg. Yes, we are very excited about the renewal of our $4.25 billion credit facility. The team just did a great job, and we’ve got great support from a lineup of banks. In terms of indicative pricing right now, 10-year U.S. treasuries, we just received this morning above 4%, call it, 4.2%, 4.3%. When we look at sterling, we’re probably in 3.7% range. And then euro-related debt, high 2s, 2.8% to 3%. And as you know, part of our strategy is to really take advantage of the European execution from a liability perspective. And so as part of our capital strategy, we’d be looking to execute in sterling. And depending on how things pan out throughout the rest of the year, potentially execute from a euro perspective as well.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. And then in terms of how you might be thinking about raising debt this year, I mean, do you guys feel a need to get more permanent financing versus using the revolver? Or are you comfortable just based on where the acquisition guidance is just continuing to load up there?
Christie Kelly: I think what you can expect from us, Greg, is to just really be consistent as we executed, for example, in April with the private placement of approximately $800 million. We have a delayed draw on that. So the paydown is in June. And as you mentioned, we’ve got our revolver, and we also have our commercial paper program that is even further pricing inside the revolver. So we’ve got a lot of opportunity here in front of us to fund our acquisition volume and do so within the range of guidance.
Greg McGinniss: Okay, thank you very much.
Christie Kelly: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: Next, we will go to Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Your line is open.
Nicholas Joseph: Thank you. Maybe just following up on that line of questioning. Just with the sterling debt issuance and the other capital raising, how hedged are you from a cash flow and asset exposure perspective today?
Christie Kelly: Hi, Nick. Yes. So from a hedging perspective, we have hedges in place that we’ve executed both from an interest rate perspective. The team executed those back in the 2020 time period in June. And as you can imagine, we’re in the money. And it was very well designed as it relates to the current environment.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. And then just on external growth. I mean just given the 1Q activity and then the casino deal under contract, what were your thoughts on moving acquisition guidance with this earnings release?
Sumit Roy: Nick, sorry, you cut off. Could you repeat that last question, please?
Nicholas Joseph: Sure. Can you hear me?
Sumit Roy: Yes, I can. Go ahead.
Nicholas Joseph: Yes. So the question was just on maintained acquisition guidance, just given the pace of acquisitions year-to-date and then also with the casino under contract for later in the year, if there are thoughts of moving up the acquisition guidance or just given kind of the uncertainty in the market, how that all blended together in your thinking?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So Nick, if you recall, when we first came out with our guidance, this was in late October, I think, of last year, which was very unusual for us, and a lot of what was driving that thinking then was making sure that people were able to underwrite what this merger was going to mean for the pro forma company. And we had come out with a number of $5 billion, approximately $5 billion. We haven’t changed that. And like you’ve said, we’ve obviously made the announcement subsequent to that initial guidance of a $1.7 billion transaction. And what I can share with you, Nick, is not all of that $1.7 billion was contemplated when we had first come out with the $5 billion. In fact, we weren’t even sure we had a deal at that time. So could that $5 billion go up? Yes. But what I – what keeps us a little bit on the sidelines is this continued volatility that we are seeing on the capital markets side. And from a pure sourcing perspective, as you can see from the numbers that we’ve posted, from a – the next 4 to 5-month pipeline perspective, I can continue to share with you that the momentum is there. It is incredibly positive. And what sort of keeps us sort of hedging is what’s going to happen in the last 4 to 5 months if this continued volatility remains. We are very comfortable with the $5 billion number, and it’s actually, we say, above $5 billion. And I think we can also go so far as to say that not all of that $1.7 billion, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter, was contemplated when we came out with the numbers that we did.
Nicholas Joseph: Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure. Thanks, Nick.
Christie Kelly: Nick, I just wanted to follow-up, too, to make sure that I captured the breadth of your question. I also wanted to just share that as we’ve talked about, that we use foreign debt to serve as a natural hedge on our foreign assets. And probably the only other thing you’d be interested in is we also have FX forwards in place to hedge some of our foreign earnings.
Operator: Okay, alright. Next, we will go to Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is now open.
Michael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Can you give us an update on the VEREIT merger and how the G&A synergies are trending so far?
Sumit Roy: Sure. I’ll start off. And then Christie, if you wouldn’t mind just addressing the run rate on the synergies. With regards to the integration itself, I think it has gone according to plan. I would even go so far as to say it’s ahead of plan. The two companies are integrated from an organizational perspective. The personnel have integrated into their various teams. Common procedures and processes and controls have been adopted. And we are clearly seeing that on the acquisition front, on the asset management front and the property management front, etcetera. So I think organizationally, we are where we were hoping to be. In terms of synergies, I’ll let Christie take that question.
Christie Kelly: Thanks, Sumit. So we had shared during the transaction that we were focused on executing $45 million to $55 million in synergies. And from the perspective of where we are right now, we’re tracking towards the higher end of that range and well ahead of plan.
Michael Goldsmith: That’s helpful. And as a follow-up, more focused on Europe. Given what’s transpiring there, can you provide an update on the health of the investment landscape in Europe broadly and then maybe touch on some of the specific regions? And then within that, your European portfolio is more concentrated in certain retailers. So how do you – over time, how do you look to diversify that to kind of spread – to spread out the exposure? Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure, Michael. Very good questions. Look, I think by design, we had chosen to enter into Western Europe. And we, by design, chose the UK primarily because of the ease of affordability of our cost of capital and processes and tax regime, etcetera, etcetera. You’re absolutely right that we have chosen to continue to work with some very large operators, and that investment pipeline has continued to be a major source of our growth of what is today a $5 billion portfolio. The good news here is the operators that we are partnering with they are very, very large. And so there is a tremendous amount of runway for us to continue to do the consolidation. I think there was an element of your question that also touched on, given what is happening in Eastern Europe, how are we impacted? How are our operators impacted? What I can share with you is, as of right now, all of the operators that we have done business with in Europe, none of them have operations today. None of them have operations in Russia, Ukraine or any of the adjacent countries that are potentially being impacted by what’s playing out in Eastern Europe. The only operator ironically that does have some element of exposure to Russia is actually Couche-Tard that has about 36 assets, which is less than 1% of their overall footprint – global footprint that is based in Russia. And outside of that, none of our operators today have operations in either of those impacted countries. So we have a tremendous amount of pipeline. We have a fair amount of runway to not only continue to grow with the operators that we’ve established, but also as we branch out into new countries with other dominant operators in those countries, and some of which, as you can tell, Carrefour was a brand new name for us, and we did the sale-leaseback in Spain. We have continued to grow that name. And as we continue to add more and more countries, and even within countries, as we get more comfortable with the landscape and operators, you’ll start to see a few other very large names get added to our client registry, so, so far, so good. And by design, we’ve stayed on the western side of Europe. And those businesses continue to do well.
Operator: Okay, alright. We will go to our next question, Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, I guess, it’s good afternoon out there, as well. 
Christie Kelly: Hi, there, Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste: Hi, there. So you guys sold $122 million in the first quarter, you said mostly VEREIT assets. But I guess I’m curious how much more is there left to sell in that platform that you’ve identified? And I guess why were there so many vacant properties there to lease? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Yes. It’s about – so I’ll answer your last question first, Haendel. There is about 156 assets that are vacant in our portfolio close to 11,500 assets. So it’s not significant, as you can tell which is clearly why we have 98.6% occupancy. Look, for us, it is – this quarter happened to be one where of all the assets sold, about 97%, 98% – I believe it was $118 million $119 million of the $122 million were vacant asset sales. And even that number was largely dominated by two industrial assets that we sold vacant where we were able to strike very good total return profiles. This is going to continue to ebb and flow. There’ll be quarters where we have some occupied assets that we have opportunistically decided to sell. And clearly, selling vacant assets is very much part and parcel of our business. And when we do sell vacant assets, we give you a total return profile on what is the unlevered return that we were able to achieve, which this first quarter was north of 9% on an unlevered basis. So these are assets that we may have held for 10, 12, 15 years, have generated a fair amount of cash flow. And even when sold vacant, especially in inflationary environments, it allows us to create and capture the kind of returns that we are posting. But the point I want to make and I want to leave with you, Haendel, is selling vacant assets is absolutely part of our business. We go through an asset management analysis where we try to figure out what is the most economic – what is the most positive outcome in terms of the economics of selling the asset, re-leasing the asset, repositioning the asset or entering into a negotiation with the existing client. And once we sort of go through that, we make the determination to go down one of these paths. And that’s what drives our thinking in terms of how we decide whether to sell vacant assets or occupied assets. And that will continue to be the mantra that dictates our asset management strategy going forward.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. That’s helpful. Maybe some comments on business – thinking of business overall, I understand you’re not in a position of having to sell assets, but just curious if you’re maybe thinking a bit differently here, maybe selling a bit more in light of the movement in rates?
Sumit Roy: So Haendel, do you think what we’re experiencing today is going to continue on? Because, yes, if what we have experienced in the market more recently sort of creates this disconnect between private market valuations and public market valuations, and obviously, selling assets becomes very much part and parcel of our strategy. Truth be told, Haendel, we’ve never, outside of those very small pockets of time, i.e., when the pandemic first started, where we had a few weeks where there was a dislocation. For a sustained period, we’ve never encountered a scenario where asset prices were being valued in the private market higher than what our public market valuation indicated. But if that were to play out, hypothetically speaking, we would not be averse to raising capital, if needed, through asset sales. This is, again, I think, will accrue to our benefit given the quality of assets that we have being able to assemble especially over the last 10 years, and more specifically, over the last 3 to 4 years. So that continues to remain a strategy but one that we hope doesn’t play out because I think the only scenario where I can see that happening is a macro environment where things are incredibly uncertain. And I hope that, that doesn’t play out that way. But look, it’s absolutely a theoretical strategy that we can lean on if needed.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. One more on the guidance, maybe for Christie, you reversed the $10 million of movie-theater-related reserves. I’m curious what’s left that opportunity bucket here today and what’s contemplated in the guide. And maybe a question on the lower end of guidance, run-rate FFO was closer to $0.95. You didn’t raise the lower end. Maybe help us square that a bit? Thanks.
Christie Kelly: Yes. I think certainly, Haendel, I mean, in terms of the overall reserves that we have remaining from the COVID time period, it’s approximately $30 million. And the majority of those deferral arrangements are going to be in effect as of July. And so in accordance with our guidelines and the like, we will be ensuring over the next 6 months towards the end of the year that we’re collecting in accordance with our deferral arrangements. And so as it relates to guidance, we really don’t have anything else factored in of note into the midpoint of our guidance.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Okay, we will move to our next question. Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Caitlin Burrows: Yes. Great. Maybe on the tenant side, Sumit, earlier, you referenced it briefly, but obviously, you have a lot of individual tenants. What’s your impression on how they are doing? To what extent they can pass along inflation impacts to their customers? And how that ultimately impacts their ability to pay rent?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Look, it is certainly a story that is playing out very differently for those that are well-capitalized businesses versus those that tend to be smaller operators in this high inflationary environment. We had Neil’s team, the research team, do an analysis on our top 150 clients. And they represent about 85% of our rent. And we were like very focused on what is going to happen to their balance sheet, their ability to pay in the event that interest rates were to rise 300 basis points from where it is currently. And, this is a big and, they didn’t have the ability to pass through any of those increased costs that they were bearing on to their customers, which is a highly unlikely scenario, but we were trying to figure out what would happen in that particular scenario for us. And it was 11 of these operators of the 150 representing less than 5% of our rent where the coverages fell below 1x. So, we feel like – again, by design, we have created a client registry that’s predominantly made up of very well capitalized operators. But those one-off operators – and Caitlin you are right, we have 1,000 different clients. So, we certainly have a few one-off operators that tend to be smaller operators. It is going to be more difficult for them to be able to absorb this and their inability to pass through their costs. But we have had a few general merchandising stores. We have had a few folks who are going to – who have actually talked about increasing EBIT margins because of their ability to pass-through a lot of these costs. And predominantly, our client registries made up of those types of folks. So, yes, hypothetically, Caitlin, the smaller operators will suffer in this environment and may not make it. But thankfully, we don’t have too much exposure to that, and it is very small in terms of percentage of our overall rent.
Caitlin Burrows: Great. Thanks. And then maybe just as a follow-up to an earlier question regarding that $45 million to $55 million of VEREIT-related G&A synergies. Christie, could you just clarify to what extent Realty Income is already at a good run rate, or how much further there is to go when you think I will get there, just trying to think of the cadence and timing there?
Christie Kelly: Yes. I think, Caitlin, we are already over the midpoint of our guidance for the first year of execution. And to that point, we probably have 10% to 15% more to go. There is essentially some lag associated with timing that will also spill into 2023, but we have made excellent progress as a team.
Caitlin Burrows: Thanks.
Christie Kelly: Thanks Caitlin.
Operator: Next we will go to Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Ronald Kamdem: Yes. A couple of quick ones for me. Just going back on sort of the gaming acquisition, I think you have mentioned in the opening comments still on track. Can you remind us what else sort of needs to be done before that’s done and dusted? And the follow-up is just, have you sort of gotten – received more interest in sort of the gaming side? And is that an opportunity? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Hi Ron. Yes. So, the biggest element to closing this transaction is the licensing process, and we are well in the midst of going through that process. We have submitted our application. It is being reviewed by the Massachusetts Gaming Group. And we are very hopeful that by fourth quarter, we will be in a position to close this transaction. But that really is the one outstanding element to be able to close this transaction, but so far so good. Everything that we are hearing, everything that we have received in terms of MGC’s response to our initial application has been quite positive. So, we feel pretty good about that. In terms of the industry itself, no surprise, we are getting a lot of inbounds from potential sale-leaseback opportunities. And the team is reviewing them one at a time. But our thesis around this particular space remains the same. We want to partner with the best-in-class operators and find assets that are truly one-of-a-kind, just like we did with the Boston asset. And if at a very high level, those criterias are met, we will absolutely continue to increase our exposure to this particular sector.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And if I could just sneak in one more. Just earlier in the call, you made some comments about sort of the top 150 tenants in the portfolio and 85% of rents. And when I think about aspirations of doing these larger sale-leaseback opportunities, just you take a step back, how many of those clients potentially do you think are – would be interested this would be the right solution for them versus it sort of have to be new relationships, new tenants for sort of these larger sale-leaseback deals in the future? Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure. So Ron, I mean you have seen us grow our existing relationships to areas where they start to dominate our shareholder registry. So, for instance, I will give you a perfect example. We did the first sale-leaseback with Dollar General. This was, I believe in 2015- 2016 timeframe, and it was maybe $130 million, $140 million sale-leaseback. We subsequently continued to grow our opportunity with Dollar General through multiple sale-leasebacks. It’s a similar story with 7-Eleven. A lot of these clients that you see in our top 20 have grown over multiple years and they continue to have ambitious growth profile. So, that channel of growth remains for us. Then we also have the ability to do first-time sale-leasebacks in a large way with clients like Wynn. These are asset classes that tend to be very large. But again, given that we are about a $57 billion, $58 billion company today, it is going to register as a 3.5% client. And clearly, we have said this very openly that in the event, Wynn decides to continue to execute and grow their footprint beyond the two locations that they currently have, we would love to continue to partner with them. And so this is a function of being able to do first time sale-leasebacks in a big way. And now that we are of the size that we are, our ability to absorb those – and when I say big, I mean $1 billion sale-leaseback, even multiple billion dollar sale-leasebacks that has grown over the last few years and especially post the VEREIT merger.
Ronald Kamdem: Helpful. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Next we will go to Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Joshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hey everyone. Sumit, just wanted to follow-up on your comment that cap rates tend to lag, interest rate moves by six months. So, I guess why not maybe slow down acquisitions a bit and kind of weight maybe towards the back half of the year to kind of get that better cap rate?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Hi Josh. I wish our business was a spigot where you could switch it off and turn it back on at a moment’s notice. Unfortunately, our business doesn’t work quite like that. When you think about how we source opportunities and how we create a pipeline of opportunities and what is the timing that it takes from making a decision to pursuing a particular transaction and then closing it, it could take anywhere between four months to six months from start to finish. So, unless you have a crystal ball, it is very, very difficult to be able to sort of do exactly what you suggested, which would have been perfect, if we could. The other thing I would tell you is there is a lag even in our cost of capital. When you have volatile situations like this, but you are seeing opportunities that seem very well priced on a pure real estate underwriting in terms of replacement costs, in terms of price per pound, and you think about the leases that we are able to capture with the clients that are engaging in these types of transactions, you obviously build into your underwriting a particular buffer. And hopefully, we have been conservative enough where we are still being able to capture positive healthy spreads to our cost of capital while continuing to enhance the – our basic AFFO per share growth as well as our client registry with new relationships. So, it’s very difficult. We had a different mindset over the next six months to nine months, which said, hey, the world is going to fall apart. We absolutely will pull in our horns just like we did in that very first quarter right after the – it was actually the second quarter of 2020, when the pandemic hit where we slowed down our ability to sort of continue looking at transactions, and truth be told, even the market there, the transaction market sort of went silent for a bit, just because people are very unsure of how things are going to play out. But that I have already shared with you is not the case. Sourcing remains very healthy. And we feel like even with the appropriate flexing of our own cost of capital, we are able to grow our business in a manner that is very much aligned with our acquisition strategy. But Josh, I will be very honest, if our views change, we will stop continuing to build the pipeline. But that is not the case right now.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. That’s fair. And then maybe another follow-up about expanding into other countries in Europe, what is it that get you comfortable to expand outside the UK and Spain?
Sumit Roy: The right opportunities. There are already a set of countries that we have preapproved, so to speak, internally and have shared with our Board that there are countries that we would like to be able to grow in the event the right opportunities come along. We have identified the businesses that we would like to do business with. We have identified the clients. We have identified the fact that these are businesses that will continue to thrive even in cycles like the one that we are experiencing. And if those boxes are checked and we are able to sort of strike the right balance in terms of spreads, etcetera, that’s what’s going to allow us to continue to expand our geographic footprint in Western Europe.
Joshua Dennerlein: Great. Thanks guys.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Josh.
Operator: Next we will go to John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.
John Massocca: Good afternoon.
Christie Kelly: Hi John.
John Massocca: So, I think historically, you have kind of looked at long-term same-store growth. I understand you have a target for guidance this year. But long-term same-store growth is being right around 1%. And some of the things you are seeing in terms of maybe rent on renewals and just the effects of increasing prices across the real estate world, in general, increase that outlook, I mean is that enough to move the needle, or is it just – it’s obviously going to primarily be the rent bumps you have in place. But I mean can that be big enough given the lease expiration schedule to move that up maybe noticeably?
Sumit Roy: Well, John, that’s what makes us different, right. I mean if you look at our world, vis-à-vis our peers, we are at right around 8 years, 8.5 years. And if you look at our lease maturity schedule and I think I said this during my prepared remarks that 12% of our leases are going to renew over the next 2.5 years. And so it does – if we can keep this momentum, I don’t know if it will be 106%, but the other thing I would say about that 106% is it’s effectively net increases. And so if we can keep it in that ZIP code, that will become a major growth driver for our business, and it will become an internal growth driver of our business, especially if we continue down this highly inflationary environment. The other good news is if you think about our international expansion, a lot of those leases tend to be CPI-adjusted leases. And they don’t tend to have this collar – a ceiling and a floor that we experience here, but it’s a relative comment. I would say the vast majority of CPI leases that we have here in the U.S. tend to have a collar. And I would say maybe one-third to even 40% of the leases in the international markets tend to be – basically do not have a collar around it, and they are very much tied to CPI growth. And so I think all of that will start to percolate through our portfolio and will help us drive more internal growth than what we have historically experienced in our business. And we think of this as an opportunity, and we have been talking about asset management now for about 5 years, 6 years in anticipation of what we are now starting to experience as a company. And so look, we think we are very positively set up to take advantage of this situation. And it then helps us alleviate some of the pressure of just growing through external measures, which of course, is also something that the team is doing very well.
John Massocca: And then on the external growth side of things, obviously, you are a bigger company, so you would expect this to grow. But the development pipeline seems to kind of keep taking legs up. I mean is there something specific driving that?
Sumit Roy: Yes. It’s by design, John. We want development to continue to tick up because we do get more spread doing development. And this allows us to continue to be the one-stop solution that our clients are looking for. And just to be super clear, we are talking about build-to-suit on 99% of our development. So, I mean…
John Massocca: Are you talking about client demand, or is that something just you haven’t been exploiting that market maybe 3 years ago the same way you are today?
Sumit Roy: John, they are build-to-suit. So, by definition, they are being driven by our clients coming to us or coming to a developer and saying we would like to have you develop here in this particular location because we would like to enter into a long-term lease. And we have either relationships directly with our clients who then ask us to work with the developer or with some developers who have asked us to become their capital source as a permanent takeout. And that is what’s allowing us to continue to enhance our development pipeline. So, this is absolutely being driven by the clients, not by us. This was just a hole in our overall strategy that we are now addressing in a meaningful way.
John Massocca: Okay. That’s it for me. Thank you very much.
Sumit Roy: Thanks John.
Operator: Next we will go to Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Linda Tsai: Yes. Hi. In terms of driving higher internal growth that you just mentioned, is there a range you would like to target or move towards over time?
Sumit Roy: 10%. Linda, I am not trying to be flippant, but look, our intention is to try to drive that up. Some of it will naturally come with the expansion in asset types. There are certain asset types that lend themselves to higher organic growth. That was part of the attraction that we had with investing in industrial assets, and we saw that. And some of these other asset types, just like I said, do have a higher profile than the 1% that we have traditionally been able to get in the space that we had targeted historically. So, could I see that tick up, that’s the hope with more international acquisition, with more industrial, with more development where we can create more bespoke leases. If we can get that 1% to 1.5% to 2%, that would be a major uplift and a source of internal growth. But that’s not going to happen overnight. It’s going to take us time, and it’s going to take intentionality, which we certainly have.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. And then just to follow-up, any general update on the theater business? To the extent you have seen more recovery, would you look to sell some of these assets?
Sumit Roy: We are not quite there where we would want to sell our theater portfolio, Linda. In fact, all indications have been all trend lines have indicated that the theater business is getting back to a strong footing despite all of the noise that we hear about the theater business and PBOD [ph] and all of that. In fact, I was looking at some numbers in the first quarter of 2022. We are back to about 75% of 2019 levels. And so clearly, this is a business that is largely driven by content. We are also very encouraged by the pipeline of big-tent movies that are going to be released over the next two months to three months. We are very hopeful that, that will translate to more attendance. And the good news is a couple of these large operators like Regal and AMC are cash flowing positive on the assets that we own. So, I think all of that leads us to believe that this industry as we had hoped and our hypothesis was is sort of on demand. Having said all of that, we also did a fair amount of downside scenario analysis where we looked at some of these locations and we feel like we have the ability, the capital, the relationships to reposition these assets in the event that the business doesn’t play out. I think the wrong economic decision today would be to sell some of these assets at what I would consider to be fire sale prices. And again, just to remind everyone, 82% of our portfolio is in the top two quartiles of performance for both these operators. So, we feel very good about the theater business, but more specifically about the portfolio that we own. And so the decision to sell, though a theoretical one and has been considered, is one that we are not in a position to execute on given some of what I just said.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-23 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Chris, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Realty Income's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2021 Operating [Technical Difficulty]. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Julie Hasselwander, Senior Manager, Investor Relations at Realty Income. You may begin.
Julie Hasselwander: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's Fourth Quarter and 2021 Year-End Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements.  We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-K. [Operator Instructions]..  I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. As I reflect on the past year at Realty Income, I remain inspired by the dedication of our colleagues who continue to relentlessly pursue numerous profitable growth initiatives while contributing to a record year of acquisitions for our company.  During the fourth quarter, we closed on the merger with VEREIT, welcoming many talented new colleagues that will further help drive our ambitious goals while amplifying our competitive position in the industry. We are committed to a seamless and successful transition as we collectively work to integrate our one team, processes and systems. We remain on track to achieve over 75% of our annualized G&A cost synergies in year one post-merger, as we outlined upon announcing the merger in April of last year. Specifically, we have achieved over $42 million of our $37.5 million targeted synergies in year one, representing full year 2022, with over $50 million in G&A synergies expected in year two, representing full year 2023. Also, I continue to be impressed by the talent and dedication of our new team members as we work to integrate our two platforms and further strengthen our one team. And while we creatively bring together the best practices of VEREIT and Realty Income with our integration efforts to productively scale our operations, I'm encouraged by our integration work completed to date and our journey ahead.  Beyond the merger, our business set a quarterly record for investment volume in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we strengthened our foothold in Spain through additional high-quality acquisitions, including our second acquisition of properties leased to a key partner in Carrefour, one of the world's leading grocery retailers.  Our strategic expansion into Continental Europe meaningfully increases our total addressable universe, as we estimate the total addressable market in Europe to be $8 trillion, nearly double that of the U.S. We expect our investment activity in Europe to continue contributing to our competitive cost of capital as we look to further hedge our currency risk with debt priced at meaningfully lower yields than in the U.S.  Looking forward, we are well positioned to continue creating value by capitalizing on our portable competitive advantages globally to deliver favorable risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. With regards to recent developments, as previously disclosed this month, we announced our intent to acquire the Encore Boston Harbor, the East Coast's leading integrated resort and casino located less than 5 miles from downtown Boston. The $1.7 billion acquisition is being consummated at a 5.9% cash cap rate with a 30-year initial lease term. The property represents our first investment in the gaming industry and would represent less than 3.5% of our pro forma annual rent. While the property type is new, the lens we use to pursue the merits of the transaction is not. Our investment strategy centers around partnership with best-in-class operators occupying high-quality real estate locations, which is particularly important when entering a new business vertical and geography. We followed this strategy with the Diageo sale leaseback in 2010 when executing our first transaction in the Vineyard space, with the Sainsbury's sale leaseback in 2019 when expanding our business internationally. And more recently, with the Carrefour sale leaseback when we entered into Spain last year.  Our debut transaction in the gaming industry with Wynn Resorts represents the same commitment to partnering with the premier leaders in the respective industries together with a commitment to our overall investment strategy. The Encore Boston Harbor acquisition will add further diversification to our industry and client roster. After closing this transaction, we expect Wynn Resorts will become one of our top 10 clients. Our capacity to pursue and absorb a transaction of this size with a single client was supported by the enhanced size and scale that we gained through the VEREIT merger. And it is a testament to our ability to complete large-scale transactions without significantly impacting our prudent portfolio diversification metrics.  The Encore Boston Harbor transaction meets our key investment criteria and illustrates that our investment opportunity set is not constrained by a particular property type. The merits of this transaction are first, the real estate. We're acquiring 3.1 million square feet of high-quality real estate strategically located on the banks of the Mystic River. After opening in 2019, the property is still ramping but already generates $210 million in annual EBITDAR, resulting in 2.1x rent coverage initially.  Second, the client lease. We are entering into a 30-year triple net lease with attractive annual rent escalators at 1.75% annually for the first 10 years and the greater of 1.75% or CPI thereafter capped at 2.5%. Wynn Resorts is one of the largest premier gaming operators in the U.S. with an enterprise value of approximately $20 billion. They maintain a healthy balance sheet, moderate leverage and significant liquidity. Third, the industry performance. The gaming industry in the U.S. has recovered to pre-COVID levels. And in Massachusetts, gaming revenues grew 17% in the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, outperforming the aggregate regional gaming market that grew 8% during the same time frame. Pending regulatory procedures, we expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2022. Craig and his team have been a pleasure to work with, and we are pleased to cultivate this new relationship with Wynn Resorts as we expand our universe of net lease investments across many industries. Now turning to the results for the quarter. We are pleased with the continued strength of our core operations. We ended the quarter with our portfolio at 98.5% occupancy based on property count. Bolstered by the inherent quality of our real estate and enhanced by the proactive efforts of our talented and experienced asset management team, we re-leased 232 leases this quarter, recapturing 101.8% of expiring rent and bringing our full year 2021 recapture rate to 103.4%.  Since our public listing in 1994, we have executed over 4,100 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on those re-leased contracts. We continue to report our quarterly recapture rates and believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry and is a testament to the merit of our asset management team.  After closing the VEREIT merger, we look forward with an enhanced key competitive advantage of size and scale. With an enterprise value of more than $57 billion, our portfolio now includes over 11,100 properties leased to approximately 1,040 clients in the United States and Europe across a diversified set of 60 distinct industries.  Our total portfolio annualized contractual rent increased by over 50% since the end of the third quarter, ending the year at over $2.9 billion. With our expanded size and scale, we have greater client and industry diversification, which further improves our competitive positioning to pursue large portfolio or sale-leaseback transactions in the fragmented net lease industry and be a one-stop solution for multibillion-dollar opportunities. Since the end of the third quarter, our top 10 client concentration has decreased to 29.1% from 34.8%, and we believe it represents one of the highest quality portfolios in the net lease industry. Additionally, our top industry concentration has decreased, creating additional investment capacity. Our top 5 industries now comprise 40% of our annualized contractual rent compared to over 43% at the end of the third quarter and a top industry exposure, which includes convenience stores and grocery stores have declined meaningfully. With the growth in concentration of our targeted industries, theater and health and fitness industry concentrations have naturally declined. In terms of the casual dining contribution from our VEREIT merger, the majority of their concentration is with Red Lobster that has experienced improved operating performance is now owned by Thai Union an established strong financial sponsor.  Our international geographic concentration also declined pursuant to our VEREIT transaction, providing further room to achieve profitable growth in Europe and beyond. We have already started to see the benefits of our expanded platform through increased sourcing and acquisition volume. In 2021, we sourced approximately $84.5 billion of acquisition opportunities and approximately 39% was sourced from international markets. Reflecting our stringent investment criteria, we closed on approximately 8% of the total opportunities, bringing our total 2021 property level acquisitions to $6.4 billion, an annual record for our company. Of the $6.4 billion invested in 2021, over 40% or approximately $2.6 billion was invested during the fourth quarter. Over $1 billion of our volume in the fourth quarter was the result of international investments, bringing our total international portfolio to nearly $4.3 billion of invested capital at the end of the year. We believe the market is efficient, and we're experiencing a competitive environment for high-quality assets leased to strong operators. Accordingly, the quality of our acquisition is reflected in our average initial cash cap rate during the fourth quarter of 5.4% and 5.5% for the year.  The largest industries represented in our fourth quarter acquisition were European grocery stores and U.S. automotive services, which represent a continued investment in industries well positioned to perform in a variety of economic cycles, given its necessity-based retail proposition for consumers. The weighted average remaining lease term of assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 14.2 years. We continue to generate healthy investment spreads of approximately 140 basis points during the quarter and 150 basis points during the year, consistent with our historical average, while acquiring, in our view, the highest quality product in the marketplace.  Inflation has been an important topic to investors in the last few months. I want to emphasize that we believe our business is, by design, well positioned to drive shareholder value in this climate.  From a balance sheet perspective, having a well-staggered fixed-rate debt maturity schedule with no corporate bond maturities until 2024, limits our debt refinancing risk in a potentially rising rate environment. And we believe we actually benefit from an inflationary environment given our lease expiration schedule and our proven ability to recapture more than the value of expiring rent upon re-leasing.  Finally, the value of our business is largely tied to current income as a recurring cash flow vehicle, which makes the value proposition of owning realty income comparatively more attractive during inflationary periods, as compared to other sectors in the marketplace whose value is high to growth in future years.  At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter.
Christie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. We continue to prioritize a conservative balance sheet structure while procuring attractively priced capital. During the quarter, our capital markets activity was highlighted by the issuance of over $1.7 billion of equity, primarily through our ATM program, which enabled us to simultaneously complete the VEREIT merger and finance a record quarter for acquisitions while finishing the year within our targeted leverage parameters. As we emphasized when we announced the merger in April, we intended to close the transaction in a leverage-neutral manner relative to our target leverage level, which we are pleased to have accomplished. One of the benefits of our enhanced size and scale is daily trading liquidity in our stock that provides us with the ability to issue significant amounts of equity through the ATM in a cost-efficient manner without disrupting the market price of our stock.  As a result, we entered 2022 from a position of strength with a net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDAR of 5.3x. Subsequent to year-end, we issued $500 million in sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes, pricing 5-year and 20-year notes at a blended all-in yield of 2.28%, with a weighted average term of 12.5 years.  This was the third sterling-denominated debt offering we have priced in the last 16 months, and we could not be more appreciative of the support we have received from the Sterling fixed income investor base.  Moving on to the financial results for the quarter. In fourth quarter, our business generated $0.94 of AFFO per share, supported by our healthy portfolio, closing of the VEREIT merger, strong acquisition pace and collection of almost 100% of contractual rent during the fourth quarter. Going forward, we will no longer be providing COVID-19 disclosures as we believe portfolio operating performance has returned to pre-pandemic levels in terms of overall collection. In 2021, our business generated $3.59 of AFFO per share, finishing near the high end of guidance and representing 5.9% annual growth. Given the health of our portfolio and our active global investment pipeline, we remain comfortable with our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing 8.8% annual growth at the midpoint.  Realty Income was founded on the principles of income generation and capital preservation. We remain committed to delivering monthly dividends that increase over time as part of a consistently attractive total shareholder return proposition. In December, we were pleased to have increased our dividend by 5.1% as compared to the same period last year. The increase in the dividend was intended to share with our shareholders, the accretion from the recently closed VEREIT merger, together with continued earnings accretion that we were able to generate throughout the year from our business.  We have now increased the dividend 114x since our 1994 listing and remain proud to be 1 of only 3 REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend for at least 25 consecutive years.  Now I would like to hand the call back to Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. We remain humbled by our collective accomplishments in 2021, including the completion of the merger, but also with the strength of our full year results and our attention now turns to the path forward.  Realty Income has a bright outlook for 2022 and beyond, and we look forward to continuing to build a strong and resilient platform as we embrace the opportunities that lie ahead. As we enter a new year of possibilities, we remain steadfast in our purpose of building enduring relationships and brighter financial futures, while relentlessly pursuing ways to provide shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long run.  At this time, I'd like to open it up for any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Bradley Heffern: Can you talk quickly about how you got comfortable with the risk profile of the Wynn acquisition? Obviously, it's a very large single asset. There are some different regulatory risks involved. So do you see that as being fully compensated for by the higher cap rate and the higher escalators?
Sumit Roy: Yes. The short answer, Brad, is yes, we do. For us, our thesis is quite simple. We want to try to partner with the best-in-class operators and get the premier assets that they operate. If you look at the Boston Harbor asset, it is the premier superregional asset in the United States. If you look at the coverage, and this is an asset that is still not fully stabilized, it's at 2.1x. If you think about Wynn, they are an S&P 500 company that is arguably the best operator in the space. If you look at regional gaming and compare it to the volatility associated with the strip, it tends to be a lot less volatile. And more specifically, if you look at the Massachusetts market, which has grown at almost 18% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Even compared to the national average on the gaming side, it was almost 2x that.  If you look at the actual asset itself and you see what we've paid for the asset and compare it to what was actually invested in the asset, and these are all public numbers, you'll start to get very comfortable with the fact that we feel very comfortable about what we've paid in terms of replacement cost.  And we've been very open with the market with respect to our desire to continue to explore new avenues of growth and this is one that completely fits that profile of trying to partner with the best-in-class operators and trying to add best-in-class real estate to our portfolio.  If you look at the lease structure, it's a 30-year lease with growth that is in excess of what we are able to generate on the rest of the portfolio. And those are the reasons why we felt this was the right opportunity for us to sort of enter into the gaming space, with the right operator as a partner and with the right asset.
Bradley Heffern: Okay. Thanks for that. And sticking with Wynn, if you did another transaction with them of the same size, obviously, that would likely make them the #1 client. So how do you think about the future of gaming? Is it likely that we'll see another transaction with Wynn? Is it likely that we'll see another one with another operator?
Sumit Roy: Look, we did our first transaction in this particular space. So we are very hopeful that we can continue to grow this area. And as long as we feel like we can structure transactions for the right properties with the right operators, we are very happy to grow this area of our business. We've been very open with the market about playing across the risk spectrum with regards to yield, and yield for us is a proxy for the risk associated with it.  And if we feel like on a risk-adjusted basis, we're able to grow our portfolio even within gaming, we'll be very happy to do so. We continue to talk about how important partnerships are for us and Wynn is that. It's a long-term partner. And in the event they decide that they would like to pursue other transactions, we would like to be there for them and continue to grow our exposure to gaming and in particular, our exposure to Wynn.
Operator: The next question is from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Your line is open.
Nathan Crossett: Maybe just following up on those questions a bit. Can you tell us anything about -- was this a competitive bid process? How many bidders? How many rounds? And then I'm assuming there's no other gaming assets in the pipeline right now, but is there a way you could confirm or deny that?
Sumit Roy: I'm not going to answer your second question. But the first one, there was no process. This is -- like we said, we emphasize relationship above all else. And we wanted to partner with Wynn. And this came about through a conversation that started towards the end of last year. And so there were no rounds. There were no other folks. It was purely a relationship-driven transaction.
Nathan Crossett: Okay. Interesting. Thank you. Maybe just a question on pricing more broadly. Cap rates continue to come down. I think the commentary across the space is that there remains a lot of pressure there, even with funding costs kind of going up. So what are you kind of seeing, I guess, in your pipeline right now? And what's kind of your expectation, I guess, for the numerator side of the equation this year?
Sumit Roy: Yes. That's a very interesting question, Nate. We continue to see a very aggressive cap rate market, especially for the type of products that we are pursuing. We would have thought that given the fact that we've been in this -- expectation of higher inflation, higher interest rate environment that would start to sort of percolate into the rest of the acquisitions market, we haven't seen that yet.  Now history would suggest that cap rates do tend to adjust, especially if some of these increases become more than just an expectation. But at least the current market situation is one where we are not seeing even a stabilization of the cap rate, we continue to see downward pressure.  And this is where being able to partner and lean on relationships, et cetera, is going to allow us to potentially get that 5, 10, 15 basis points above market. And that is the hope. But I do think that in the next six months to nine months when interest rates do rise, that cap rates will follow suit. This is a phenomenon that we have seen played out in the past, and there is no expectation that it's not going to play out, but we don't see that currently.  In terms of what are we underwriting for the rest of the year? Our hope is that it is slightly above where we ended up last year, but we can't guarantee that. Our pipeline is incredibly robust with, again, opportunities that we love. And like I said, at least in the current market, we are not seeing cap rates move.  The one point I will add, and I think I covered that in my prepared remarks is the fact that we have inherited a team that was very used to focusing on the higher yielding side of the market. And that's part of our business. And that particular team has already started to produce results, above and beyond what we were being able to do pre-merger. And so could we see that help us on being able to achieve slightly higher cap rates? Potentially, but it's still too early to tell. But that is a team that is -- has hit the ground running and is performing as we had expected, and it's great to have them as part of the broader team.
Operator: The next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.
Greg McGinniss: You're going to hear Encore a bit more here. Hope you don't mind. Just curious how you went about getting expertise on the gaming space that was necessary for underwriting this new vertical? And then who from the team is getting licensed to allow for the acquisition in Massachusetts?
Sumit Roy: Greg, like a lot of things. We are so blessed to have a set of colleagues who are capable of understanding a new industry, are capable of underwriting the risk associated with that particular industry. And the fact that a lot of us have come from previous backgrounds that lends itself to a much wider realm of industry focus than what we were doing here at Realty Income also allows us greater confidence.  The fact that we partnered with Wynn and to work with Craig and his team, that tool allowed us to continue to refine our thesis around the risks associated with this business. And we are very comfortable that we have underwritten this particular opportunity appropriately. And we have leaned on experts where needed and also obviously leaned a lot on our own research department that continues to be the best-in-class in my opinion, across the street.  And that's how we got very comfortable with this new vertical that we are pursuing and more specifically with the operator that we have partnered with over the long term.  In terms of your second question with regards to who's going to go through the licensing process? Too early to tell. I know Michelle, our General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer, is working very closely with the MCG and is trying to figure the answers to those questions. But I don't have a precise answer on that for you yet.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. And then Craig Billings mentioned that in terms of the deal only achievable due to the unique way the Realty being structured, are you able to further elaborate on that comment? And then also, why are you comfortable not requiring the CapEx minimum where the gaming REITs do typically require one?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Again, this was very important to Craig and his team. The fact that we were able to create a bespoke lease that works for them and works for us was very important to both partners. And for us, we are not in the habit of going out there and essentially copying leases that our precedents within this space. We approach this as a relationship, and we try to address what their pressure points were. We try to understand what causes those pressure points. And therefore, came up with a very bespoke lease that works for our partner at Wynn and works for us.  With respect to minimum capital requirements, et cetera, we feel like the entire brand of Wynn is associated with their investments in their properties. And you don't have to take my words for it. You just -- you can go and actually visit the property and see for yourself what I mean when I say that. And the fact that we don't have that specifically outlined in the lease is one that we were very comfortable with. Plus there are other protections that supported to us through the gaming licenses that you get in the Massachusetts. And so we feel like looking at it holistically, we are very well protected. Partnering with somebody like Wynn who invests in their properties above and beyond what most other operators do plus certain other provisions that we could lean on I think, gave us the comfort and allowed us to partner with them because that was a pressure point for them. So we are very, very comfortable with where we ended up. And we were glad we could do it and structure it so that Craig and his team were very comfortable moving forward.
Operator: The next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.
Caitlin Burrows: Maybe moving to a different topic. Sumit, you mentioned earlier that lower-cost European debt helps to support investment activity in Europe. However, taxes do seem to be another piece to consider. So just wondering if you could give an update on how you consider the tax impact on your decision to acquire in the U.S. versus abroad?
Sumit Roy: Yes, Caitlin. That is certainly a cost of doing business in Europe and one that we take into account when we are underwriting assets and looking at long-term return profiles of opportunities that we ultimately end up pursuing.  And one of the ways we try to protect ourselves is by essentially match funding with local denominated currency these acquisitions, which is why if you look at it, the international portfolio on a stand-alone basis, you will find that we have raised a lot more debt to finance that business while not compromising obviously, on a fully consolidated basis, the overall leverage profile of our business. And the interest expense associated with that debt is a natural hedge and a natural protection to minimize the effective tax rate that we end up paying. So that's a very important point in our capital strategy of how we want to continue to grow our European business.  Having said that, it is true that the cost of debt in Europe, even in this increasing rate environment, continues to be less than what we can achieve here in the U.S. Today, I would say, if you were to look at a 10-year unsecured, it's probably in the 3.1%, 3.2% ZIP code for us. Whereas we can probably get 2.8%, 2.7-ish percent in the U.K. and 1.9%, potentially even slightly less in Mainland Europe in terms of 10-year unsecured bond. So that's what I meant when I said that our cost of capital is very portable and the advantages that accrue to us due to this cost of capital and our ratings essentially, gets inflated when we are able to take advantage of markets such as Mainland Europe and the U.K. So that's the strategy, and that's what we feel most comfortable with.
Caitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. And then maybe on the tenant side, you guys ended the fourth quarter with occupancy at 98.5% guidance is for about 98% this year. So I realize that's a potential small shift, but we do hear how healthy tenants are these days. So wondering if there's something in particular that you're expecting or if it's more of a general buffer, which then could you just comment on the watch list maybe more broadly?
Sumit Roy: Yes. That's a good question, Caitlin. And it's the last statement that you made, which is how we think about occupancy. We say it's roughly around 98%. Keep in mind, we've also just inherited 3,000 assets through the merger that we have digested and we feel very comfortable saying that it's right around 98%.  If you look at where we were last year, you look at the year before that, that tends to be the guidance that we gave to the market. Look, we could flex that number. We could try to have a higher occupancy number, if that was a target for us. But what we are trying to balance Caitlin, and I'm just sharing a little bit about how we think about our business, is trying to optimize the economic outcome on each one of these assets that is coming through to us. And we try to figure out whether it makes sense to sell it and maximize our total return profile, even vacant or invest capital and try to capture the rents and create a profile that is superior to selling it vacant or completely repositioned that asset. And all of those elements are on the table, and we go through and we try to figure out what is the best outcome. And the reason why we say 98% is because there will be a few assets that we want to hold on to and reposition and/or take the time to find the right tenant so that we maximize the total return profile. And that does sort of put downward pressure on our occupancy number. So when we talk about approximately 98%, it's to give us the flexibility to do what we want to do on the asset management side.  And you probably have tracked this, you can see that we have, more often they've not beaten that. So it really is more a mindset rather than a very precise point that we are trying to strike with regards to occupancy is to give us this flexibility that we need to maximize economic outcome.
Operator: The next question is from Spenser Allaway with Green Street.
Spenser Allaway: Given the strength of tenant credit within gaming, you mentioned the coverage levels, the attractive lease terms. As you consider additional gaming deals, does your view on tenant concentration change? Or said differently, how high would you allow any one gaming tenant to go given you could argue it is a superior credit relative to some other traditional retail tenants?
Sumit Roy: That's a great question, Spenser. Look, we obviously have certain speed bumps that's part of our investment policy that imposes certain restrictions on tenant concentration as well as industry concentration. Just so you have it, with regards to client concentration, it's 5%. And with regards to industry concentration, it's 15% as per our investment policy. So you have those speed bumps, if you will, to sort of make sure that we continue to be a very diversified portfolio. Having said that, we just executed on a -- well, it's not closed yet, but we've announced a $1.7 billion transaction. And yet, it's going to represent less than 3.5% of our overall client concentration. So we clearly have more room here, both on the industry side as well as on the specific client side to grow this business. We haven't entered into the gaming industry to basically say this is one transaction and we are done. This does become a new avenue of growth.  However, we will continue to remain very selective in terms of how we decide to grow this particular area. But those are the metrics that you can look to sort of to help us through the concentrating, both on the industry side as well as on the client side. But we certainly would like to grow this business. And for the right opportunity, we are more than willing to compromise some of these limits that we have in our investment policy. Of course, it will require Board approval, but we've done that in the past.  If you recall, Walgreens used to be north of 5% at one point. So was 7-Eleven. And post the merger, both of them have dropped below 5% today. But for the right clients and the right opportunity, we are more than happy to make compromises on those limits.
Spenser Allaway: Okay. That actually answered all my follow-up questions. And but -- so maybe one more. As you continue to identify new lanes of external growth, just curious if you've explored the possibility of expanding into ground leases similar to what we've seen ABC do?
Sumit Roy: Yes, Spenser, I think this is a question that's been asked before. I want to say about 2.5% of our revenues come from ground leases. But let me tell you that when you go into this market today and a particular opportunity is being marketed as a ground lease, i.e., there's a building, but you don't really own the building. If you look at the pricing, the expectation of the seller is that you're paying for both the building as well as the ground because the building is going to come with the ground at the expiration of the lease term. And so yes, it's -- you can claim that this is a ground lease that you are purchasing, but the actual proceeds being paid for those opportunities, are essentially a fee simple opportunities. So we don't talk about the fact that a certain portion of our rent concentration comes from ground leases, primarily because we recognize that more often than not, we are paying for the building as well. And so yes, I'd love to be able to start talking about ground leases that we have, but the cost base is on those ground leases, you recognize to be fee simple transactions.
Operator: The next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.
Ronald Kamdem: Just a quick question. Following up on sort of the sale-leaseback opportunities. Just want to get a sense of sort of post the merger closing. Just what resources has been allocated in terms of personnel or structure to going after these sort of opportunities and so forth?
Sumit Roy: Well, if you track our personnel count, and I think Shannon started posting those, but I don't know. You will see that we have grown our team quite a bit. And some of that has sort of translated into a more normalized G&A number. And if you look at where we ended up in 2021, it's at 371 people. If you compare that to where we were at the end of 2020, it was closer to 230-odd folks. And so the team has grown. Part of it obviously came through the VEREIT merger, but also organically in order to continue to pursue and expand the avenues of growth, we have rightsized the team both on the research side, on the acquisition side, on the asset management side, on the property management side, et cetera, et cetera.  And so I think this is a reflection of a business that is continuing to grow and not only grow in its traditional routes, but also continue to increase new avenues of growth. And so that is going to translate into a broader personnel base as can be seen by these numbers.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. And then my second question is just on your thinking about sort of external growth opportunities. You've talked about sort of looking at higher-yielding structures and so forth. Just curious how much thought goes into potentially looking at higher escalator structures similar to sort of the transaction that went through?
Sumit Roy: A lot is the short answer. If you look at our straight-line cap rate for 2021, the headline number was I think 5 4 for the fourth quarter, but there's 80 basis points of straight line. So it's really a 6.2% straight-line cap rate for the fourth quarter. And so you can imagine the only way to generate 80 basis points of straight-line rent on an annual basis is through these higher growth rates embedded in the leases. And so that is a conscious effort on the part of Mark and Neil's teams who continue to generate that inherent growth profile that we have traditionally and make that a much higher number going forward.  And so part of how we think about looking at new opportunities, new verticals, is to see the profile of the existing leases that are percolating in the market within those spaces. And that is certainly an element that we take into consideration before deciding to pursue routes.
Operator: The next question is from Katy McConnell with Citigroup.
Mary McConnell: Just wanted to follow up on an earlier question on taxes. I'm just wondering what the higher tax expense guidance for the year is factoring in, in terms of your targeted U.S. versus international acquisition mix for this year?
Sumit Roy: Christie, do you want to take that?
Christie Kelly: Sure. Thanks, Sumit. Thanks, Katy. Yes, the higher taxes are incorporating our international growth, Katy, which is very similar to what we experienced this year as well, as Neil and the team are making some great progress.
Mary McConnell: So just in terms of a targeted mix for U.S. versus international, what should we be thinking about this year relative to last?
Christie Kelly: I think that international, you could be looking at 35%, 65%, 60-40 U.S. international.
Mary McConnell: Great. That's helpful. And then just regarding the acquisition pipeline, are there any other new investment categories that you're still actively exploring outside of gaming that you can speak to or update us on? Where you're finding similarly attractive investment or opportunities today?
Sumit Roy: Yes, Katy, I won't go through the areas that we are internally discussing, exploring, underwriting, because that becomes an exercise in futility, right? We talk about certain avenues and they don't materialize, and then it becomes a constant question in every subsequent call as to when we are going to go into it. We'd much rather consummate a transaction, get it over the finish line and then discuss our rationale as to why we chose to go down the path of entering into that new area. But suffice to say, Katy, we are exploring multiple avenues of growth. And some of the discussions that we've had on this call should give you an insight into what is driving our thought process around new avenues that we would like to consider going forward. But I just don't want to engage in a conversation right now, Katy, with respect to going into too much details on what those are because some may never materialize. And so just bear with us, and I want to be very clear, there are new areas that we are constantly looking at. And if and when we are able to get something over the finish line, we will absolutely talk to you, and you can grill us on the details as to the why we chose to pursue those routes.
Operator: The next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.
Joshua Dennerlein: A question on what percent of your ABR is on cash accounting basis? And then could you provide some color on the rent repay that you got in 4Q on the previously uncollected amounts?
Sumit Roy: Christie, you want to take that?
Christie Kelly: Sure. Yes, of course. So essentially, when we're taking a look at the overall deferred rents and impact of -- essentially, collections have been exceedingly strong. The total deferral amount is about $140 million, $150 million as of 12/31/21 at the end of the year. And we're achieving a very strong collections in that regard. As we also noted in the fourth quarter all of our theater clients are current. And so great progress.  And then in terms of what you would have seen in the fourth quarter, because of those strong theater collections, we actually recorded total bad debt expense of less than $1 million and less than $15 million for the entire year because of the fact that we had those strong collections.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. And sorry, did I miss what percent of your ABR is on cash accounting basis or...
Christie Kelly: We have overall cash accounting basis on ABR, modest I want to say. Yes, it's less than 2%.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. Perfect. And then sorry if I missed this in the opening remarks, but the Encore acquisition, it came with an expansion opportunity. Could you maybe walk us through this opportunity and the additional economics it would offer?
Sumit Roy: Sure, Joshua. So there is a parking lot that is across the street from where the main building is located. Today, if you talk to Craig and his team, they're actually having to pass on some of the patrons given the lack of parking space that is required to accommodate this increase in traffic. So the goal is for them to develop a multistoried aboveground, potentially even below ground parking that is going to not just be a parking lot, but also it's going to have an entertainment venue of up to 1,000 seats, maybe it's 999 seats. Plus a few other entertainment areas right in that -- in the same building that is going to get constructed across the street. And it's going to have an enclosed tunnel, aboveground tunnel pathway that leads right into the casino into the Encore Boston Harbor building from this building. And so the expectation is that this is going to get built over the next couple of years and will actually add to the overall performance of the building.  And clearly, this is a very symbiotic relationship between this parking lot, this enclosed pathway that's going to connect the 2 buildings. And so we -- they have the ability -- once constructed, and there's a 6-year time frame within which they have to do this, which gives them plenty of time to be able to consummate their current plans. We will buy this building at a 7% yield. And obviously, this should translate into even better coverages than we currently have at the particular building. But that is the option that you're referencing that's there in the lease. Josh, did that answer your question? Josh, I think, you're muted.
Operator: His line is now closed. And the next question is from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.
John Massocca: First, just a quick kind of detailed question. Was the Wynn transaction kind of contemplated in your prior guidance? I just think, obviously, the per share results won't be heavily impacted given the expected timing, but it was just notable that there wasn't really a change in acquisition outlook.
Sumit Roy: John, I think you've been covering us for many, many years, and you probably have a very good understanding of when we talk about acquisitions, when we talk about guidance, it really does not have the underlying opportunities perfectly laid out because we don't have that visibility. There's a confidence level, there's a feel for the market. There's a feel for the opportunities that we are seeing. And that is the reason why based on the earnings guidance that came out, the underlying acquisitions guidance was above $5 billion. We don't know what the makeup or the composition of $5 billion worth of transactions are going to look like, some of which could be assets like the gaming asset that we just announced. But that's a very big asset.  So we feel now even more confident that above $5 billion is very much an achievable number, assuming that we are able to close on this transaction by the fourth quarter. But it is very difficult to say, oh, you should completely exclude this number from the $5 billion or it was inclusive of the entire $1.7 billion, just given the sheer size of this. But what it does allow us to do is stand in front of you today and say with a high level of confidence -- a higher level of confidence that achieving a north of $5 billion number for this year is, in fact, something that we feel very good about. So that's how I would answer that question.
John Massocca: Okay. Understood. And then maybe thinking bigger picture, you've obviously been in the net lease space for a long period of time. As you look back to other periods of times where you've been in a rising interest rate environment, and you compare it to the kind of current environment we're in, what do you think are kind of the factors, if you will, that will drive cap rates to be more reflective of kind of rising rates?  And I guess maybe as you look at kind of the competitive set that you compete with for these net lease investments, how kind of interest rate sensitive maybe are they today versus kind of the competitive set in other periods of time kind of similar to the one we're in today?
Sumit Roy: Yes. That's a very good question, John. I can tell you that based on our own internal analysis, we have obviously seen the cycle before. Rising interest rate environments, what happens to cap rates then. And what we found is that there is a positive correlation between rising interest rate environments and cap rates, but there tends to be a bit of a lag now. Is it 6 months, 9 months, 12 months? It's somewhere in that ZIP code, but there is. And if you think about it fundamentally, obviously, if cap rates are rising, especially in the private markets that leans on the debt environment a lot more, the cost of that debt is going up.  And so at some point, there's a mismatch between existing cap rates and the cost of financing that particular opportunity. And so those do tend to sort of balance out and reach an equilibrium point. That's what we've seen in years past.  There is one difference in today's environment, and that is that net lease as a product has become much, much more institutional. And we have seen a plethora of capital coming into our space on the private equity side, on the sovereign wealth side and, of course, with the preponderance of public net lease companies that have recently come into the floor.  So I think that wall of capital that is now interested in net lease is going to potentially put a curve on how quickly we get to this equilibrium point going forward. And I think in this sort of environment, once again, the fact that we are an A-, A3-rated company. And yes, our cost of debt will certainly go up and has gone up. But it will tend to go up less than a lot of our competitors who are perhaps not as rated as highly. And also in the private markets, the folks that lean on leverage a lot more and therefore, there -- the impact to their cost of capital will be much higher than the impact to ours, I think is an advantage that should allow us to continue to do transactions that others might have to step away from. So even though I believe in today's environment, that the equilibrium point might take a little bit longer to achieve. I believe that some of the advantages that Realty Income as a platform is able to sort of embrace. I do think that, that will play out more in our favor and will allow us to do things that others might not be able to get to as quickly.
Operator: The next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.
Linda Tsai: I believe the later 4Q closing of the Wynn transaction is typical for the industry, given regulatory considerations, but what are your general thoughts around buying high-value assets or portfolios that close at a later date to create more visibility in terms of funding and hitting investment targets, do you see advantages to this approach?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Linda, that's a very good question. And I think I've received questions around, "Hey, this is a very large transaction, it's $1.7 billion. How are you going to finance it?" For us, yes, it's a single transaction, but that the size of that transaction is -- it's not unprecedented. We just did $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. And -- just in that quarter, and we're able to match fund our acquisitions by raising our equity, $1.7 billion of equity in the fourth quarter through the ATM.  And obviously, we did some more debt on the unsecured side post the fourth quarter. So for us, I think, again, one of the big advantages that we have is the liquidity that our stock affords us. We are trading close to $200 million in stock on a daily basis and are able to very easily raise capital to match fund, what might seem nominally as being a very large number, we are able to match fund it without this overhang situation. So we -- if it closes in the third quarter or whether it closes in the fourth quarter, it doesn't really matter to us because we'll have a much better feel for it internally.  And we'll be able to match fund accordingly. So yes, it's a big number on a single asset, but I don't think we see this as necessarily causing any overhang or should not cause any overhang issues for us.
Linda Tsai: And then in terms of vacated boxes, you talked about weighing the decision between selling and maybe putting some capital back in to maximize value. Could you give us some examples of how you've repositioned boxes in the past and maybe what type might be more amenable to the strategy currently?
Sumit Roy: Yes, Linda, that is very much a function of the type of box that we are talking about, a convenience store could be converted into a car wash or could remain a convenience store. A 10,000 square foot box could be turned into a 2 or 3-tenant box that actually generates 150%, 160% of expiring rents.  We've had examples of Pizza Hut that have been converted into Starbucks in multiple places. And there are a lot of coffee chains that are aggressively growing their portfolio and are more than willing to pay for repositioning of either previous QSRs or Pizza Hut et cetera given the location, et cetera, and are more than willing to pay us rents that are in excess of what the expiring rents were in their previous life. So those are some of the repositionings that we have accomplished to date and what we hope to be able to do because these can be quite positive from a rent per square foot perspective is to grow that part of our business going forward, and that is the goal. But yes, so far, so good.
Operator: The next question is from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.
Christopher Lucas: Just a quick question on the balance sheet, if I may. And Sumit, thank you for the sort of current pricing on 10-year debt that you see out there. I guess just curious as to what the capacity you think you have today is for additional sterling-denominated and/or euro-denominated bonds given the portfolio at this point?
Sumit Roy: Christie, do you want to?
Christie Kelly: Yes -- sure, Sumit. Yes, Chris, I think from that perspective, we've got plenty of runway for 2022 in order to be able to execute in alignment with our capital strategy. And further to this, realize it wasn't part of your question, but we're also looking forward to executing on the euro market, too.
Christopher Lucas: Okay. I guess the point of the question really gets to -- you've got a number of bonds. They're not near term, but they're sort of intermediate terms that are coming due at above market relative to sort of what you think you could do today. Just curious as to how you think about how aggressive you'll be in terms of looking to essentially refinance that debt?
Christie Kelly: Yes. And I think Chris that's -- for example, in 2022, we have a very modest debt maturities. And in terms of what we articulated as it relates to the VEREIT transaction, we're very focused on that here in the coming years, and we will be aggressive in that regard.
Sumit Roy: The only other thing I'll add, Chris, is we've done liability management throughout the years. Even last year, we went ahead and we paid the 2023s and the '24s out. So this is something that we will continue to monitor. And if it makes sense, we are more than happy to prepay our unsecured bonds and take advantage of interest rate environments that we find ourselves in. So I just wanted to leave you with that, but that is certainly a tool available to us, and we will avail of it at the appropriate times.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I'll now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Chris. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with many of you soon at the upcoming investor conferences. Take care. Bye-bye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-02 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Emma (ph.) and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2021 Operating Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Thank you. Julie Hasselwander, Investor Relations at Realty Income. You may begin your conference.
Julie Hasselwander: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income, Third Quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law.  The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a 2-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call-in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may re-enter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. Our strong relationships with all our stakeholders enabled the success of our business, and we thank everyone listening for your continued support. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation of our expanded Realty Income team for their tireless efforts in executing on our strategic objectives.  Today, our business is at an inflection point, where the advantages of our growing size and scale, provide us an accelerating number of opportunities, compounding our aptitude for growth. We see momentum accelerating across all facets of our business as a result of the following growth catalysts: 1. the depth and breadth of our active global pipeline remains robust. During the third quarter, we acquired over $1.6 billion of real estate across 3 countries resulting in approximately $3.8 billion year-to-date.  We now expect to invest in over $5 billion of real estate in 2021. an increase from our prior guidance of $4.5 billion. Second, we believe our expansion into Continental Europe during the third quarter with significantly deepen our addressable market at attractive spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. Particularly given the comparatively low unsecured borrowing rates in the European bond market.  Third, our asset management activities continue to generate strong results, at the end of the third quarter, our portfolio was 98.8% occupied. And we achieved a rent recapture rate of 107.2%, illustrating the relentless efforts of our asset management team and highlighting the quality of our real estate. And finally, with the closing of the VEREIT merger, we believe our size, scale and diversification will further enhance many of our competitive advantages which we suspect should allow us to augment our investment activities in the future.  The closing upon merger with VEREIT, as well as the anticipated and subsequent spin-off of substantially all the combined Company's office properties, which has previously announced is expected to be completed on November 12, allows us to provide enhanced clarity on our near-term earnings run rate. To that end, we are increasing our 2021 AFFO per share guidance to $3.55 to $3.60 representing 5.5% annual growth at the midpoint.  And we're introducing 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97% representing 9.2% annual growth at the midpoint. Our 2022 guidance assumes over $5 billion of acquisitions and over $40 million of year one G&A synergies we have identified as a result of economies of scale from the merger. These guidance ranges also assume that the anticipated spin-off of our office properties is consummated as anticipated on November 12th. With the closing of the merger, our combined Company eclipses $50 billion in enterprise value with size and scale to support new risk growth verticals. Providing flexibility to close large transactions without creating concentration risk.  Additionally, through this merger, Realty Income has inherited a pipeline platform and talented acquisition team focused on sourcing higher-yielding products that will be additive to our existing pipeline. Further, over time, we expect to generate meaningful earnings accretion by refinancing very outstanding debt supported by our comparatively lower borrowing costs driven by our A3 A minus ratings and capacity to issue debt in lower yielding markets.  Finally, we are excited to integrate the capabilities of many talented VEREIT colleagues into the Realty Income business, as we continue to execute our growth initiatives as one team. Now turning to the results of the quarter. We continue to add attractive real estate to our portfolio at a rapid pace. During the third quarter, we sourced nearly $24 billion of acquisition opportunities, ultimately selecting and closing on less than 6%. Of the $1.6 billion of real estate we added to the portfolio in Q3, the largest industry represented was UK grocery stores.  On a revenue basis, approximately 38% of the acquisitions made during the quarter were leased to investment-grade rated clients. And our total investment grade client exposure remains approximately 50%. The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 13.4 years. And in aggregate, all of our acquisition activities during the quarter resulted in healthy investment spreads, up approximately 164 basis points.  As of quarter-end, our portfolio remains well diversified, including over 7,000 assets leased to approximately 650 clients who operate in 60 separate industries located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the UK, and Spain. Giving pro forma effect to the closing of the merger, and the anticipated spin off our combined office assets as of September 30th, 2021. our portfolio now includes over 10,500 assets located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the UK, and Spain.  Our international pipeline continues to add meaningful value to our portfolio, and we believe it will remain an important driver of growth going forward. In total of the nearly $24 billion in acquisition opportunities that we sourced this quarter, approximately 34% was associated with international opportunities. In the third quarter, we added approximately $532 million of high-quality real estate in the UK and Spain across 31 properties, bringing our total international portfolio to over $3.2 billion.  This quarter, our international acquisition accounted for approximately 33% of total acquisition volume. As previously announced in September, we made our debut acquisitions in Continental Europe through a sale-leaseback transaction with Carrefour in Spain. Subsequent to quarter-end, we announced the completion of an additional Carrefour transaction in Spain, bringing the value of our Continental Europe portfolio to approximately EUR160 million.  We are optimistic about our momentum in Spain as we look to replicate the success of our international growth platform throughout the continent with best-in-class operators who are leaders in their respective industries. The health of our core portfolio remains of utmost importance as we continue to expand our platform. At the end of the third quarter, occupancy was 98.8% based on property count, which represents an increase of 30 basis points as compared to last quarter. During the quarter, we released 50 units, recapturing 107.2% of expiring rent, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 105.5%.  We continue to report on quarterly recapture rates and believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,800 releases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on those released contracts. At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie who will further discuss results from the quarter.
Christie Kelly : Thank you Sumit. This quarter our business generated AFFO per share of $0.91. Strengthen by our acquisitions pace and the collection of almost 100% of contractual rent in the third quarter. During the quarter, our theater clients paid approximately 99.6% of contractual rent, representing a meaningful improvement compared to the 38% collection rate in the second quarter.  We continue to be encouraged by the strong box office performance of recent blockbuster releases which we believe signals the long-term viability of the theater industry. I was looking forward to the release of the James Bond film "No Time to Die" for months. And based on recent box office numbers, there were many across the globe. We currently have 34 of our 79 theatre assets on cash accountants, with approximately $37 million of non-straight-line reserves on our Balance Sheet.  Like our business strategy, our approach to evaluate when these 34 theater assets move back to an accrual basis and the appropriate time to reverse the allowance for bad debt reserves will be conservative and data-driven. More specifically, we will assess the likelihood of collecting on this amount by evaluating store level, and industry-wide data in conjunction with continuing payments of past due rent over a healthy period of time.  As we continue to expand our platform, we will remain steadfast and prioritizing low leverage and a conservative balance sheet strategy while financing our growth initiatives with attractively priced capital. At the quarter-end, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5 times, or 4.9 times in a proforma basis adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. Our fixed-charge coverage ratio hit an all-time high for the third quarter in a row, coming in at 6.1 times.  And during the quarter, we raised over $1.6 billion of equities, approximately $594 million, which was through an overnight offering that closed in July, and the remainder primarily through our ATM program. During the quarter, we also issued our debut green bond offering at $750 million multi-tranche sterling denominated unsecured bond offerings, which priced at a blended yield of approximately 1.48% for an 8.8-year blended tenant. We look forward to continuing to partner with our clients around sustainable practices in accordance with our Green Financing Framework.
Operator: And now I'd like to hand our call back to Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. In summary, we are energized and pleased by the momentum we see across all areas of our business. We're proud to have close the merger with varied and we expect the benefits of this transaction to be broad and lasting. Enhancing our competitive advantages and generating shareholder value for years to come.  Going forward, the possibilities of our business will be constrained by only our imagination, we look forward to continuing to execute on our strategic growth initiatives, to strengthen our position as the global consolidator of the highly-fragmented [Indiscernible] space while providing our shareholders with compelling risk-adjusted returns over the long run. And at this time, I would like to open it up for any questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Again please limit yourself to two questions please re-enter the queue. Your first question comes from the line of Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Your line is unmuted.
Nate Crossett: Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the merge.
Julie Hasselwander: Thanks, Nate.
Nate Crossett: Yes. I appreciate the color on the pipeline. I would just maybe you could give a little bit more detail, just heading into the end of the year and into next year. What is the mix look like in terms of industrial versus retail U.S versus Europe? Was there a lot of overlap in the [Indiscernible] pipeline between VEREIT [Indiscernible] or the merge? Then I'll ask my second question at same time. Just if you can comment on pricing dynamics U.S. versus Europe.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Nate. Good questions, and yes, we're so happy to have the merger behind us. In terms of the composition of the pipeline ahead, as well as what we've achieved. What we have -- we shared with the market that they should expect the international acquisition to represent about 1/3 of our acquisition volume going forward.  In terms of pricing, given surprisingly, when I looked at the spreads that we're generating, either here in the U.S. and comparing it to what we were able to do in Europe. They are very similar for this quarter. And in some quarters, we've seen that we were able to get slightly higher yields in the international markets and in other quarters, it has been the opposite.  So, there's really -- the way we are thinking about our portfolio is through the macro lens that we've identified what it is that is of interest to us. And the area that we, play in Europe is slightly narrower and it's a function of the product that's available than what we play in the U.S. In terms of retail versus industrial, as much as we would like to do more industrial, the pricing in this market keeps us a fairly constrained to that 10%. On a good quarter we are able to get to that 15%, 17% ZIP code.  But that's the composition of the industrial makeup of the overall acquisition. The rest of it is primarily retail. In terms of investment grade versus non-investment grade, we've said this in the past and I'll repeat it again. When we look at credit and we do our own analysis, we don't go out saying if it's a non-investment grade credit, we immediately disqualify it for consideration purposes.  If you look at what we were able to achieve in the third quarter, only 38% of what we did was investment-grade. So, we're very comfortable looking at non-investment grade. A non-investment grade does not necessarily mean sub-investment grade. It just means that it doesn't have a rating from one of the two major rating agencies and it might actually have a sub-investment grade rating, but we're very comfortable with that.  The last question that you had as a subpar to your first question was, in terms of there being an overlap with what we are inheriting from VEREIT, and there really isn't much, there are certainly certain, acquisition opportunities that we would find [Indiscernible] as a competitor. But they play in an area that we believe can truly be additive to our overall platform. And the high-rel side.  And we're still blast to inherit this, this team. And we're really looking forward to being able to completely integrate them into our acquisitions team and have them continue to pursue the transactions that they will pursuing and potentially not be constrained by the cost of capital. So, we genuinely believe that this is going to be an incremental to the acquisitions that we were able to achieve on a standalone basis. And then with respect to pricing, I think I address that through my spread comments so, Nate, I don't know if there's anything specific you want me to dive into.
Nate Crossett: No, that's all very helpful. Thank you. I'll get back in the queue.
Sumit Roy: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Your line is unmuted.
Greg Mc Ginniss: Thanks, Sumit. Hi, Christie. Thinking about the merger with VEREIT, where they have fewer true triple-net leases on average than you guys do. What percent of leases after the acquisition and spend are truly triple-net or will truly be triple-net. And will we be looking to offload some of those non-triple-net leases, and then in general, how should we be thinking about the level of dispositions versus the 5 $billion or more of acquisitions in 2022?
Sumit Roy: Good questions, Greg. Look, I think the only area where I felt like we probably had non-triple net leases was on the GSA side of the equation on the office sub-portfolio that they had exposure to. Otherwise largely Greg, they -- these are triple-net leases. And if you think about how this particular portfolio was put together, we'll be able to give you a lot more color once we've got it all integrated, but I'd be very surprised to find gross leases -- preponderance of gross leases on the retail side and the industrial side of the equation.  Obviously industrial products, the landlord tends to be responsible for things like roof and structure, which one could argue is not a pure triple-net lease, but that is largely the same case with respect to our portfolio as well.  But the property maintenance is still the responsibility of the client, the end of the property taxes, the insurances -- insurance on those buildings are still the responsibility of the clients, so we still view those as predominantly net leases. So, with the separation of the office assets through the spend and the GSA leases, I think we are going to be largely a net-lease portfolio, very similar to the one that we have. So, I don't think that that's going to pose any major issues, Greg.
Greg Mc Ginniss: Okay. Yes, I was just looking at their various disclosure, has a net around 30% on the retail side, 40 something percent on the industrial side, it's double net, but I get your point on the level of obligation that's really entailing. And then in terms of the level of disposition we should be thinking about whether there's any cleanup there, or just in general versus the $5 billion of acquisitions?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. We've been doing about a $100 million to a $150 million. The audio we've gone past $200 million in dispositions on a standalone basis. We would like to inherit and really do a similar analysis on the portfolio that we are inheriting with VEREIT to see if that needs to be altered. A lot of the capital recycling that they were doing pre -merger was on the office side of the equation.  And so, I don't know if the number will dramatically increase beyond a linear extrapolation of going -- adding another $10 billion, $14 billion of assets. So maybe the 150 becomes 250, 275. But give us a quarter to digest this and filter it through our own asset management lens and we'd be able to come back to you with a lot more precise indication. But we don't suspect that it's going to be dramatically different from the run rate that we were doing on a standalone basis.
Greg Mc Ginniss: Okay. And then just one quick point of clarification on the $24 billion [Indiscernible] opportunities, you said 34% was international, is that all of Europe or is that just UK and Spain for now?
Sumit Roy: Primarily UK and Spain, but we are certainly looking at other geographies that we have identified as core to our expansion objectives but it is primarily in the UK and Spain.
Greg Mc Ginniss: So, we could see that source number go up as you start looking more intent.
Sumit Roy: As we start expanding, yes, you should expect that to go up.
Greg Mc Ginniss: Okay. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Brad Heffern: Thanks, everyone. Hey, how are you? On the acquisition guide for 2022, you've talked about how the VEREIT team, the additive but then the guide is the same, the same over $5 billion for 2022. So, is that just beginning of the year conservativism because there's limited visibility in the pipeline or how should we think about that?
Sumit Roy: Look, what did we start this year with? It was right around $3.25 billion. Then we went up to $4.5 and now we're about $5. And we want to come out with numbers that we are -- we have a very high level of certainty associated with it. And as we start to develop our pipeline and visibility, we expect that number to go up. But we don't want to come out with a number that we feel like it's overly aggressive coming out of the gate.  So, this has been something that has been very important to us to be able to deliver to the market what we say we will deliver. And as such, you should consider this to be our initial guidance. And the hope is we can do better than that. And with time and as soon as we are in the next year, we hope to be able to get more precise around what the acquisition guidance will ultimately turn out to be.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Next one. Maybe for you, Christie. Also, on the '22 guidance, is there anything in there that would be considered kind of one-time in nature, like maybe a reserve release from the theaters or anything like that. We need to consider?
Christie Kelly : Hi, Brad. There is nothing of a onetime nature, including reversal at the theater returns.
Brad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.
Christie Kelly : You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open.
Haendel St. Juste: Hello out there.
Sumit Roy: Hi Haendel.
Christie Kelly : Hi Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste: So, I was intrigued by your comments, you mentioned inheriting a team that experienced acquiring high-yielding assets, that'll be added to your platform, and then you also mentioned being very comfortable acquiring hiring yield.  I was going to ask you this quarter's 38% investment grade volume was an anomaly, but it doesn't sound like it is. So maybe, can you talk us through your thoughts on portfolio strategy with regards to high-grade going forward and if you are signaling, perhaps a slight shift in your overall thinking of portfolio strategy.
Sumit Roy: I'm here to alleviate any confusion Haendel. There are a lot of -- if you look at our top 10 clients and we have Carrefour that shows up there. And Carrefour is a non-rated Company. Yet if you were to look at its Balance Sheet and you were to look at its credit metrics, it would imply a very strong investment grade credit but that does not show up in the 38% investment-grade.  So, we've been playing in the area that we've identified coming out of the strategy sessions that we alluded to in the past. And we feel -- sorry, that's actually Sainsbury it's not Carrefour. Carrefour is actually rated triple B. So, when we come out and we share with you the actual investment-grade numbers, it is truly an investment grade rate rating by either S&P or Moody's.  But we play across the spectrum. But we are so focused in the area that we've identified as our area of growth that -- are we as focused in some of the higher-yielding product that our inherited team from VEREIT was focused on. Potentially not. Are we going to do everything that VEREIT was acquiring as a standalone Company? Probably not. But we are trying to create a team and we truly believe that team to be complementary to ours and now it's one team that is going to be able to play across the credit spectrum and be able to truly be an incremental source of acquisitions for us going forward. S o there'll be quarters where we do more than 38%, in fact, we've done up to 50%, 60% of investment-grade, and then there'll be other quarters where we don't. I don't want you to put too much rating to this headline number of how much investment-grade are we actually pursuing, because as I've said to you, that that's a by-product of our strategy, not what drives our strategy.
Haendel St. Juste: Great, appreciate the thoughts and clearing that up. Christie, not to beat a dead horse, we've talked about it over the last quarter too, it's been asked on the call today and I guess I'm really still a little reflector still surprised that there hasn't been a recognition of revenues of the movie theatre site. You pointed out a number of the positive industry dynamics that the industry is experiencing here. So is it just more [Indiscernible] And it sounds like certainly right now there isn't any of that in your 20-22 guide. So just trying to square your comments with the I guess the lack of recognition or any sense of timing on that.
Christie Kelly : It really, in a nutshell, is timing. We did in the third quarter experience payoffs according to our deferred arrangements, the handful of theater properties and they're back on accrual counting. And we'll continue to evaluate on an asset-by-asset basis and we still have remnants of COVID out there.  We want to make sure that we're evaluating this, not only on an asset-by-asset basis, but also just in terms of what's happening in an [Indiscernible] macro perspective. So, more time. And we'll be back to report to you.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Christie Kelly : You bet, Haendel.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Caitlin Burrows: Hi everyone, congrats on the merger and all the recent progress. Maybe digging a little deeper on the pipeline, I'm wondering if you can talk about the difference in what you're interested in abroad versus the U.S. I think you mentioned that the abroad pipeline might be a little bit narrower?
Sumit Roy: Yeah, Caitlin, it's just not as developed -- and partly it's driven by being land constrained. You don't have as many freestanding triple-net opportunities in terms of various industries and various tenants being in that space. Obviously, the size of the actual market is 2x what we have here in the U.S. But the number of industries that mend itself to sort of this triple-net concept are a bit narrower. We've already talked about grocery as being one of the areas that we'd like to focus in on. Hold improvement is another area.  But it is very unusual to find some of the other industries that we're exposed to on the retail side, being available in mainland Europe. And that's really the point I'm trying to make, this is not the constraining factor because I think we put out some numbers, etc. sharing with you how much bigger the actual market is, the addressable market is in Europe that lends itself to net leasable investing. But it really is more of an -- it's just a narrower group of industries that play in that space.
Caitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. And then given your larger size now, do you expect there to be any change in sourcing over the next year? And as a result of that, do you think there will be any meaningful change in your acquisition cap rates?
Sumit Roy: I hope so. I absolutely believe that with the newly expanded team that includes folks from what was VEREIT, we will be able to increase our run rate on the acquisition front, and we will be able to cover the credit spectrum a lot more precisely and acutely than we were able to do on a standalone basis, and that should result in not only higher sourcing, but getting more transactions over the finish line.  And that is absolutely one of the levers that we hope will play out for us. And based on everything that we've seen and based on getting to know our new colleagues better, I absolutely believe that is going to play out next year and beyond. So, but time will tell. But that is our expectation.
Caitlin Burrows: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Absolutely.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey, congrats on the VEREIT merger. Just 2 quick ones from me. The first is just going back to acquisition, and I think you've talked about what of a new $50 billion plus enterprise value less concentration risk. There are just more opportunities that present themselves. So, I guess the question is really, is the team doing anything organizationally different to try to source those deals or is the point that historically when those yields have come up, you've had the path on them, but now you could take a look at it. Thanks.
Sumit Roy: It wasn't that we were passing on deals, Ronald, it was more along the lines of -- if you look at some of our industry concentration, they were starting to creep to double-digit ZIP codes and somewhat beyond that. And the complementary nature of what we are inheriting from VEREIT, I believe, helps us on a couple of industries.  If you look at a few of our largest industries like convenience stores and groceries, etc. All of those concentrations on a pro forma basis, it's actually going to come down. And so, it gives us more capacity to aggressively pursue opportunities that we are finding incredibly compelling to try to get over the finish line. So, it just gives us more capacity, that's one.  The second is, being a much larger Company, and this is a more recent phenomenon, I think 2 years ago, maybe a little bit longer than that, was the first time I heard of a billion-dollar sale-leaseback opportunity in our space, and it was on the retail side of the equation. And we've never heard of opportunities of that size. And even for us, if we had some prior exposure to the client doing a billion-dollar transaction, what's going to start to push the concentration risk issue, and now being 1.3 times, 1.4 times the size that we were -- it is less of an issue.  And the size of sale-leaseback opportunities that are now in play are billion-dollars opportunities. Now, we haven't really seen -- there have been announcements, but we haven't seen anything get over the finish line on that front. But that to us is exactly the type of transactions that we would like to be able to show up for and be able to do and be a single-point solution for some of our clients that we perhaps would not have been able to pursue in our previous version.  And so, I think that really is what we feel will be one of the biggest beneficiaries. And also, proactively to go to some of these larger companies and be able to say -- and then for large companies by definition, doing a $500 million sale-leaseback doesn't really move the needle for them much. And so, to be able to be a solution and provide multi-billion-dollar sale-leaseback opportunities for them, I think could be a lot more compelling.  And so those are the types of things that we'd be able to pursue post this closing that we obviously thought a lot about in the past and we have approached certain clients, but it was -- we were guided by what we were hearing in terms of what is really relevant for some of these folks. I think, time will tell, but it certainly creates the platform for us to now be able to pursue some of these transactions which we were not able to as aggressively pursue in the past. Ronald?
Ronald Kamdem: Yes. Sorry about that. Great. My second question was just going to 2022 guidance. Obviously appreciate the transparency and I can appreciate these are preliminary numbers. But when I think about the AFFO guidance range, can you maybe share what that assumes in terms of same-store rent growth than the assumptions for reserves for credit losses.
Sumit Roy: We obviously gave you a couple of numbers when we came out with this. The point of coming out with a guidance at this point in the cycle, which is non-traditional for us, was largely driven by this acquisition that we did of VEREIT, and there was a lot of uncertainty around what does proforma Realty Income really look like post separation of the office assets.  And this was our attempt to sort of address that going forward. And so, in terms of the other ascension's like same-store rent and other inputs that go into the model, it is largely along the lines of what we've done in the past.  And so, you should -- and, of course, as we learn more about the portfolio that we've acquired and we look out into the future and we, more importantly, digest the 6 -- the $5 billion acquisition guidance that we have for this year, I think we'd be in a much better position to give you much more precise numbers on same-store growth etc. But for right now, you should assume it to be the 1% that we usually point to.
Ronald Kamdem: Great. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts with UBS. Your line is now open.
Christie Kelly : Hi, Brent.
Brent Dilts: Hi, Christie. I've just got a qualitative one at this point, but with the acquisitions in Spain during the quarter, could you talk about what you learned from the transactions and just how does that impact your approach in Continental Europe going forward. And I think in recent calls, you guys have spoken about trying to learn the local market and there's a lot of nuance to it. So maybe you could just provide a little color around your experience there.
Sumit Roy: Sorry. Are you asking us what is our filter of going into new markets? Is that the question Brent?
Brent Dilts: No, sorry, Sumit, it's more just what did you learn specifically from the process itself as far as like nuance to the deal structures or the negotiations, or just anything about the market that maybe you picked up.
Sumit Roy: Brent, I'll tell you very honestly, we did a lot of homework before we actually went into any particular market. We looked at transactions that have taken place in the past, we tried to understand the nuances of the structures, we considered the tax implications, a lot of the homework was done prior to us actually engaging with potential clients or the advisory community to start to pursue transaction.  So, I would say that we weren't overly surprised by the structure of the deals that we've been able to get over the finish line. The one thing that has surprised me personally, and I don't know if Neil and Mark are going to share in my comment, but it's the volume comment, I do believe that we have been able to create these relationships that have cemented to, and have translated into subsequent transactions much more quickly than what we had originally thought.  This is very much a relationship-driven market, which we anticipated but not to the extent that we've seen it play out. They are looking for long-term partners. They're looking for partners that are not in the market to flip out assets and that is right down the fairway for who we are and how we believe in generating value for our investors long-term.  The certainty of close to some is incredibly important, far more so than perhaps here in the U.S., it's not that certainty of close is not important, but they are much more price sensitive here in the U.S., than perhaps in continental Europe, as well as in the UK. So, reputation, size, scale. The fact that we do what we say does seem to be weighed a lot more significantly in all of Europe than what we had anticipated. So that's where the surprise came in, not in terms of the duration of the lease or the cap rates or the growth that we find embedded in these leases. A lot of that was known to us before we went into these markets.
Brent Dilts: Okay, great. That's it from me, guys. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Q - John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is now open.
John Massocca: Good afternoon.
Christie Kelly : Hi. John.
John Massocca: Just looking at a leasing spread renewal and releasing [Indiscernible] assets, the third quarter where you're in well above, I guess what -- even recent historical level. Do you think that above 100% recovery is sustainable here or is that maybe more reflection of where we are in the macroeconomic cycle, given the pandemic?
Sumit Roy: John, that's a good question. And if you're asking me, can we do positive 7% with next to no capital investments every quarter going forward? I think the answer is probably no. But I do think that over the last 8, 12 and even during the pandemic, the kind of releasing that we've been able to achieve without a bunch of capital investments is a testament to the quality of the portfolio that we have.  But much more importantly, it's a testament to the asset management team under the tutelage of Janine (ph.) that we are able to generate these numbers. And so, I feel like if you look at the trend and you look at what we've been able to do over the last 3, 4 years, we have generally achieved north of 100% releasing spreads.  And this by the way includes not just clients who are renewing an option, but also new clients that we are bringing in, into either empty buildings or buildings that are about to go empty. So, this is the complete picture of what we've been able to achieve. And that is one of the points that we've been trying to talk about that our business, on a normalized basis, is going to become a seven-year world business.  And a lot of value is either going to get created through this channel or not. And we've been anticipating this and building out our asset management team in anticipation of being able to generate the kind of results that we are posting on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So, we feel very good that we -- and we usually target above 100% every quarter and we've been able to do far better than that. And I'll leave it at that.
John Massocca: Okay. And then switching gears a little bit back to international, I think can we be pre -pandemic if you look that kind of [Indiscernible] for the UK acquisitions versus the U.S., right UK was always fairly significantly lower than U.S. acquisitions in that spread has kind of disappeared. Also, on top of each other in terms of day one cap rate.  So, is that a factor you think of macro, economic pushes and pulls interest rates, et cetera, or is that a more reflective of different kind of investments that you are targeting either internationally or here domestically?
Sumit Roy: It is certainly the latter. And if you're looking at grocery businesses here in the U.S., there's been a tremendous amount of compression that we've seen on the cap rate side of the equation. And I would say that the U.S. market has moved more towards the UK market than the other way around.  But there are differences to the lease structures, etc., and once again, I'm not going to go into the details, but what you see as that headline cap rate, you're seeing that they seem to be very close. There is some inter-quarter variability like I believe in the second quarter we had a slightly higher cap rate associated with international, and it was a function of the type of assets that we got, and the length of the lease terms that we were able to achieve or translated to higher cap rates.  But by and large, the spread which considers both the cap rate as well as the cost of capital, is very similar right now, very, very similar in both these markets. But I do think it's partly driven by -- we are playing in a much narrower industry spectrum in Europe. And we have been doing a lot more industrial here in the U.S. And it sorts of balances out and it yields a number that you see as the headline number posted on our supplemental.
John Massocca: That was very helpful. Thank you very much.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is now open.
Wes Golladay: Hi everyone. Quick question on the acquisition volume this year. Hi, Christie. When you look at what's driving the upside, is it more on the sale leaseback side or is the developer takeout’s broker deals, just trying to get a handle on where the [Indiscernible] is coming from.
Sumit Roy: It's a combination of all forms of development. We are doing takeout’s, we are doing -- we're actually financing 100% of developments. The one common thread is that in the vast majority of the cases, there's a lease in hand. You might see that there's a retail asset wealth, I think on the retail side, it was 93% occupied.  And that's largely driven by repositioning that we're doing. And we don't quite have the lease in hand for that one particular unit. But otherwise, it's all built-to-suit. But we play across the spectrum, providing all of the development funding, as well as doing takeout.
Wes Golladay: Okay and then when we look to next year's guidance, you do have about $750 million of high coupon debt in 2023 that is due, is it safe to assume that's not in the number or prepayment of that?
Sumit Roy: I'll let Christie answer that.
Christie Kelly : [Indiscernible]
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Christie Kelly : Thanks Wes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Katy McConnell with Citi. Your line is now open.
Michael Bilerman: Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Katie. I want to come back on the pipeline. Just come back on the $5 billion for next year. And I take your comments are trying to be conservative, it's early, you want to sort of see what the combination of the teams can do. But how did you come up with a $5 billion, you didn't pull it out of thin air, there has to been some rigor to come up with that. So, can you just walk through sort of the analysis and that you went through to come up with that $5 billion.
Sumit Roy: Sure. Look, I think as we get more and more comfortable with the strategy that we are currently executing, Michael, it gives us a lot more confidence to be able to say that this is a product that we're seeing. This is the translation rate on that product on the sourcing numbers. We feel very comfortable given the team and infrastructure we have in place that we are going to be able to accomplish the numbers that we've posted.  This year was a very interesting year for us because we had a very healthy pipeline. just like we do today come into the year. But it was post-pandemic and we didn't quite know how things are going to play out. But we felt very good about coming in and saying 3.25 billion, which we have since revised a couple of times.  And so, as we're getting more and more comfortable with the new markets that we're entering into, with the sourcing volumes that we're seeing, with the maturation of the team that we have in place, that's what is giving us the confidence. In the beginning, I assume, talk with my colleagues and we would earmark about 20% to 25% international, well today it's closer to 30%, 35% percent. We've built out the team in the international side.  We have a much more mature team and a fantastic team on the U.S side, and now we're going to inherit a group of veterans from this acquisition. So that's really the buildup that we've done internally and we feel fairly confident about to come out and say, look this year we're going to do north of 5 billion. we should be able to do that with the level of visibility and 1 year behind us now, in 2022. So that's how we came up with that number.
Michael Bilerman: Which hearing that would sound extraordinarily conservative, given all the arrows that you have in your quiver to be able to execute additional acquisitions, especially given your other comments about being a bigger Company, allows you to take on different risks, which arguably being a big Company, if you went out and did a billion-dollar portfolio then had $100 million of assets that you didn't want, well, $100 million or $50 billion isn’t that much.  How does that play into your thinking about deal flow from here? And I think you and I talked a little bit about this last quarter or the quarter before, in terms of your willingness to now accept what previously was larger risks that you may be willing to take today in terms of either type of asset, location of asset, credit of tenant, all the variety of things that may have made you pass on deals before?
Sumit Roy: I hope what you're saying is exactly right and a year from now we have a number that is far in excess of the $5 billion that we're coming out with Michael. What we don't want to do is have a particular number dictate our decision-making. We want to come out, and this is right along the lines of how we've operated the business. This is the largest acquisition volume number that we're going to be coming out with in our history. You're right, this is by design that we've created all these avenues and we should be increasing our guidance.  And perhaps there is a level of conservatism. But we would like nothing better to come in in February and revise our numbers and say, you know what, we've had a chance to revisit and be able to come in and with a high level of confidence, given all of these new strategies that we are putting a lot more effort into i.e. 1. higher yielding, 2. newer markets, 3. being able to have one quarter, 4. under our belt in Spain, 5. figuring out what we can or can't do there.  All of that hopefully will translate into higher numbers. But this is where we feel that we don't want to over-promise and under-deliver. And that's the reason why we're coming out with what we're coming out with.
Michael Bilerman: And then in terms of just from a corporate perspective, I seem time that you're going to talk to large tenants that have a lot of real estate on their books, you are much better equipped today at your size to be able to do those elephant hunting types of transactions.  How active are you in going to those corporations that have the real estate on their books where you can do a direct deal in a much larger scale? And are those further along and -- you have other capital partners as we've seen, there's a lot of institutional capital that would love to get access to the type of portfolios and higher yielding levered plays that you're doing, and so I'm just I'd like to know a little bit more on that front whether we could expect that to be a much bigger part of the story.
Sumit Roy: In the past, we have to consider partners when we were coming across these multi-billion-dollar sale-leaseback opportunities. But I think the need for that has diminished post this acquisition. We had inbounded from investors who wanted to participate on these one-off transactions, larger transactions outside of the realm of the public eye.  And we've largely stayed away from that because we felt like the transactions that we were actually seeing in the market that was near-term we could have handled all on our own. We haven't had to pursue a partnership very aggressively.  And I think the need for that has diminished even more so now, with this proforma for the very transaction, and I do believe that our willingness and desire to more actively pursue potential clients that we -- that we've talked about, that we might want to speak with and engage with is a lot higher today, given that the concentration issues that we could have entered into are somewhat muted now. And so, I do think that those types of conversations are going to be a little bit more front and center in terms of what we do. And we are going through it much more proactively. That's correct.
Michael Bilerman: Okay. And then the second topic -- last topic is about the office in -- obviously, when you announced the transaction, there was a discussion about not having a plan in place to deal with those assets that you didn't want and be able to contribute the office assets on your Balance Sheet. And you said you were going to pursue two paths, you'd have the spin as you're basically backup option and look at sales process.  Can you talk us through what led you down the path of an office spin and thinking about the dis-synergies from a G&A perspective, how you thought about the value that you would be delivering to your combined shareholder base versus a sale and taking the cash. Why spin versus sale?
Sumit Roy: So, you should assume that when we discussed the separation of the office assets, we were very clear with the market that we would have -- that we're going to pursue either a span out or a sale. And we did and where we concluded going through those to parallel path was that the spin is a far better option given where we were coming out on the sales side than not, which is precisely why we decided to choose to go down the spinning of the office assets. Putting a team that was very familiar with all of those assets, had been working very hard on assets managing those assets was, very capable of creating value longer term.  And what we -- the analysis that we went through was to say, okay, they have the thesis. It's a thesis that makes sense. There are some tailwinds in that particular sub sector. Given the success that they've been able to achieve over the last couple of years, you look at that and then you start to see what they can do with this portfolio going forward.  From an alternative perspective, this seems like the absolute right alternative for us to pursue despite the fact that selling the assets would have been an easier step for Realty Income to take. But we did pursue both those efforts in power loan and this is the path that on a risk-adjusted basis yielded the superior outcome for us, and that's the reason why we pursued it.
Michael Bilerman: Okay thanks for the time.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Josh Dennerlein: Yeah. Hey guys. Hope everyone's doing well. Now that the VEREIT merger's behind you, you curious, you added a bunch of teammates, any skill set that was brought in that would help you guys widen the aperture?
Sumit Roy: Yeah, Josh, that's what we were -- sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Go ahead.
Josh Dennerlein: No, no, please, please.
Sumit Roy: That's what we've been adhering to Josh when we're talking about being able to have a team that is very capable of playing across the credit spectrum for a lack of better phrase, the higher-yielding assets, the lower-yielding assets and being able to cover that entire spectrum with a much broader team.  That is one of the biggest advantages that we are inheriting from -- through this acquisition. And there are other advantages of teammates that we are inheriting, not just on the acquisition front, but also on, when you look at some of the data analytics work that we're planning on doing, some of the process re-engineering work that we're doing.  They have a few very talented folks in their team that will become part of some of these opportunities that we are already building out and executing upon and be able to be tremendously additive and help us accelerate some of these opportunities to the finish line and create even more efficiency. So, it's really -- I am so proud of the team that we have inherited and it's [Indiscernible] 100 people that will really help us become a complete team. And of course, helped us absorb north of 3,000 properties, which is not a not a small foot.
Josh Dennerlein: Got it. And one other question, I guess relates to dividend strategy going forward. Just kind of curious to hear your thoughts on maybe how about or things about the payout ratio and retained earnings.
Sumit Roy: So, our payout ratio is in the high 70s today. We will always be the monthly dividend Company. It took us over 25 years to become part of the Dividend Aristocrat Index, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. This is very core to our strategy going forward. And so, in years where we can grow 9.5% or 9.2% and the midpoint of the range that we've just shared with you, that will just continue to help us grow our dividends in the future.  And that is -- there will be no change to that strategy of annual growth on the dividend going forward. So really no change, Josh, but I just wanted to make sure given that you asked the question that I emphasize how important than core dividend growth is to Realty Income and nothing that we've done either recently or in the past is going to change that.
Josh Dennerlein: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Linda Tsai: Hello. With 85% of your leases having some type of contractual rent increased, can you remind us what kind of increases you obtained on the European leases versus domestic, and then across the entire portfolio going forward, what might be average weighted rent increase look like versus what it is now?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. Linda, I'm not going to give you precise information. I think it is of strategic importance to us to not be that precise on growth by geography. I will tell you that 85% of our leases have contractual growth.  Either they are in the form of fixed growth, or they are in the form of CPI adjustments, or there are percentage rent clauses into the contract. It's one of those 3 variations that make up the growth profile. You can continue to underwrite to 1% same-store growth for our business going forward, and we will update you as and when warranted, but for right now, that is the assumption you should have for your models.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. And then how should we think about the pacing mix of capital raising activity in 2022 as you move forward with a plus $5 billion acquisition run rate?
Christie Kelly : I think -- go ahead Sumit
Sumit Roy: No, no, no, please Christie, go ahead.
Christie Kelly : I'll just kick it off to say I think Linda, you can expect that to be consistent with our personal [Indiscernible] this year, in funding our business and continuing to pursue a very competitive cost of capital while maintaining our net debt-to-EBITDA.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Your line is now open.
Chris Lucas: Good afternoon, everybody, thank you for taking my questions. Really just to -- a lot of the questions have been asked and answered, but I guess just Sumit, given that scale the Company at this point and where your credit rating is.  I guess, I'm just curious as to your conversations with the rating agencies post-merger. So, if you've gotten any flexibility or indication from them that you have more flexibility on your leverage side to maintain those very high credit ratings?
Sumit Roy: I'll share the headline, but I'll let Christie speak to this point because she actually had the conversation along with Jonathan with the two-credit rate -- rating agencies. They were very supportive. When we in fact went back after our third quarter announcements and spoke with them, they were again, very complementary.  They solve the capital raising that we did and essentially front-loaded the funding of our acquisition pipeline. They continue to reaffirm their current stance of A minus A3 rating and a stable outlook. We feel like we're going to have 2 months of earnings associated with this closing. But all of the Balance Sheet, day 1, so the numbers are going to look a little bit off.  But on a proforma basis for annualized earnings, it's going to be right where we play and where the rating agencies are incredibly comfortable. So, I don't see us being put on any sort of a negative watch or what have you. We've tried to be very transparent, we've shared all the analysis with the rating agencies, and we feel very confident that they will continue to support us and maintain us at the current levels. Christie
Chris Lucas: I was just actually going to put it the other way. I'm wondering whether the scale of the Company and the diversification of the portfolio is going to allow you to do more leverage and keep the range that's really where I'm going with this.
Sumit Roy: That's a good question, Chris. I don't know the answer to that. And it's very difficult to even enter into a hypothetical with the rating agencies about that particular scenario. It's an -- they tend to be a bit of a black box. And we didn't change our leverage profile that when we were on this way up. And this, I think lends credence to the comments you're making  Chris, but we can't expect that and truth be told, we are very happy with A - /A3 rating, I think. I don't know what the incremental benefit would be getting to an Aa2 rating, but I don't know if it's going to be as significant as going from triple B plus to A minus. But it's a good question and one that I think now that you've asked, we 'll post to the rating agencies to figure out how they're going to think about this.
Chris Lucas: And then just a sort of a secondary question, when you think about how you want to finance your business, you mentioned this European rate are more attractive right now than the U.S. for financing. Would you think about financing at a higher level relative to asset base in Europe at this point than you do in the U.S from a debt-finance perspective? And how high would you go?
Sumit Roy: Yes, for us Chris, we've been very clear about what the limiting factor has been for us in Europe, we want to use domestic capital to finance as much of our acquisition as possible. But the limiting factor is always going to be the asset value.  And so that's one of the biggest advantages that we have is we can raise debt in any geography and in an environment where we see here in the U.S. as the rising 10-year U.S. Treasury not so much today, but expected. We could do a lot more on the unsecured side, assuming we continue to grow in the UK or in mainland Europe, as we grow out there.  But the constraining factor will always be what's on the left side of the Balance Sheet. And does it support, the raising or not. But could it be more levered there than here in the U.S.? Absolutely. That's one of the big advantages of why we did what we did. And on a fully consolidated basis, which is how we think about our business, we're very comfortable implementing that particular strategy.
Chris Lucas: Super. That's all I had today. Thank you so much.
Sumit Roy: Of course, Chris. Thank you.
Christie Kelly : Thanks Chris.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Your line is now open.
Christie Kelly : Hi Spenser.
Spenser Allaway: Hi. I know you spoke about development earlier; can you just more broadly talk about how the development economics vary between the U.S and Europe? And if possible, can you provide some color around what kind of deals you're expecting on the one UK development you have underway?
Sumit Roy: Hi Spenser, we're going to stay away from speaking about specific transactions. We just don't do that. And then I'm going to be asked to remember of 400 properties that we acquired. What is the cap rate on the 388 property? And it's just going to be impossible. That's really the reason why we're staying away from being very precise about specific transactions and we tried to report it to you on a fully consolidated basis.  There is no doubt that we are able to get slightly higher yield on development projects than we would on assets that are ready for delivery. And that could range. It could range anywhere between -- and by the way, that has compressed, but it could range anywhere between 25 basis points to on the odd occasion, maybe 75 basis points, 80 basis points. It used to be north of 100 basis points not too long ago. But for us, we are a yield-driven business.  Every incremental yield is a positive for us Spenser. I do believe that in our supplement, we do provide that level of clarity, we do breakout what the development yields are, and so you should be able to track that as part of our overall acquisition volume, and how much of it is attributable to the development funding. And you will see that it's definitely higher than what we are actually acquiring assets and that's just a testament to our relationships and being able to balance out the overall portfolio. And that's the strategy we continue to play out.
Christie Kelly : Thank you, Spenser
Spenser Allaway: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, everyone for coming, and we look forward to seeing a lot of you at Nerige. Goodbye.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-03 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2021 Operating Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Julie Hasselwander, Investor Relations at Realty Income.
Julie Hasselwander: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's second quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may re-enter the queue I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. Building enduring relationships is inherent to our purpose as an organization, and I would like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support. I would like to express my appreciation to all of my Realty Income colleagues who continue to relentlessly pursue our growth initiatives, while in the sustained remote work environment. We are pleased with the momentum across all facets of our business, which is reflected in our revised 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.53 to $3.59. Our increased guidance range represents an improvement of 2.7% at the midpoint compared to our prior range as well as an improvement of 5% at the midpoint versus last year and is a function of several tailwinds to our business: first, an increase to our 2021 acquisition volume guidance to approximately $4.5 billion; second, the continued improvement in rent collections from our theater clients; third, our well-priced capital markets activity since the start of June, which further positioned our balance sheet for continued growth; fourth, our active asset management activities, which resulted in occupancy of 98.5% at quarter-end and rent recapture rates in excess of 104% on lease expirations during the quarter; fifth, the overall quality of our portfolio, which has been curated, refined and underwritten over our 52-year history continues to perform throughout a variety of environments. We'll discuss each of these elements in greater detail shortly. Year-to-date, we have added approximately $2.2 billion of high-quality real estate to our portfolio, including $1.1 billion of new acquisitions in the second quarter. We continue to expand our platform as our size and scale remain key competitive advantages that translate directly into shareholder value. This quarter, we sourced more than $20 billion of acquisition opportunities, ultimately selecting and closing on less than 6%. On a total revenue basis, approximately 54% of the acquisitions made during the quarter are leased to investment-grade rated clients, which brings our total investment-grade client exposure to approximately 50%. The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 11.5 years. The largest industry represented in our second quarter acquisitions was UK grocery stores, and 7-Eleven remains our largest client. We remain well diversified as our portfolio consists of over 6,700 assets leased to approximately 630 clients who operate in 58 separate industries located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and the UK And during the quarter, we continued to generate healthy investment spreads of approximately 172 basis points while acquiring, in our view, the highest quality product in the marketplace. The quality of our acquisitions is evident throughout the entire life cycle of our portfolio as we have consistently demonstrated favorable recapture rates on expiring leases while maintaining a healthy occupancy level throughout a variety of economic cycles. During the quarter, we re-leased 58 units, recapturing 104.7% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,700 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on these re-leased contracts. And occupancy at quarter-end was 98.5% based on property count. Our international investment activities continue to support our growth outlook, and our UK portfolio has now grown to over $2.7 billion. This quarter, the UK accounted for over 50% of the $1.1 billion of total acquisitions only. Year-to-date, we've added approximately $1 billion in high-quality real estate in the UK across 41 properties. And of the more than $21 billion in acquisitions opportunity that we sourced, approximately 31% is related to international markets. As we continue to expand our international platform, we will look for additional geographies that offer opportunities similar to that of the UK. We seek to acquire real estate in markets where opportunities are abundant. There is considerable demand for sale-leaseback transactions from industry-leading operators, and the local real estate can generate long-term IRRs in excess of our long-term cost of cabin. At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter.
Christie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. We continue to prioritize a conservative balance sheet structure while procuring attractively priced capital. At quarter-end, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.4x or 5.3x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. I would note that these ratios are before our $9.2 million share offering, which closed subsequent to quarter-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio hit an all-time high for the second quarter in a row, coming in at 6.0x. And during the quarter, we raised over $457 million of equity primarily through our ATM program. Subsequent to quarter-end, we executed on two capital-raising activities to further enhance the strength of our balance sheet. In July, we raised approximately $594 million to an overnight equity offering. Proceeds were used to pay down short-term borrowings and support our active global investment pipeline. Additionally, in July, we issued our debut green bond, a £750 million multi-tranche denominated unsecured bond offering of 6 years and 12-year notes, priced at a combined all-in rate of 1.48% and a weighted average term of approximately 8.8 years. We're proud to be the first net lease REIT to demonstrate our commitment to our ESG initiatives with a green bond. This green bond creates further partnership opportunities with our clients to implement sustainable practices at the properties within our portfolio, providing support for environmentally conscious initiatives while achieving mutual sustainability goals. And we estimate that over 40% of the proceeds have already been allocated to existing green projects. More information about our green financing framework can be found on the corporate responsibility page of our website. This quarter, our business generated $0.88 of AFFO per share. And as Sumit mentioned, increasing greater rent collections are one of the drivers of our improved earnings outlook for 2021. In June, we collected approximately 51% of contractual theater rents. And in July, we collected 98.9% of our contractual theater rent. As a reminder, we own 79 total theater properties, which account for 5.4% of our annualized contractual rent. 42 of our theater assets are not on cash accounting, and we continue to recognize 100% of revenue on these assets on an accrual basis, consistent with our accounting treatment during the duration of the pandemic. The remaining 37 theater assets are currently on cash accounting, meaning we will not recognize any revenue associated with these clients until it has been received. These clients accounted for $34 million of annualized contractual rent or about $2.8 million of contractual rent per month. During the second quarter, we collected 38.3% of theater rent. The rent collections from June and July represented a significant improvement from prior periods. Our theater clients paid us 14% of contractual rent in the first quarter and an average of 31% in April and May. Assuming the pace of collections we recognize to the theater industry in July continues on through the remainder of the year, we would not expect to accrue any additional theater reserves going forward. We believe the increased rent collections reflect significant positive momentum in the theater industry. One after another, the latest blockbusters continue to demonstrate a return to normalcy for the theater industry. In mid-July, opening weekend of Black Widow brought in approximately $158 million in revenue globally, earning the record for the biggest opening weekend since the pandemic. We are cautiously optimistic the momentum we're seeing will continue while closely monitoring the COVID-19 variants. As a monthly dividend company, our mission is to invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. In July, we declared our 613th consecutive monthly dividends, and we have now increased the dividend 111x since our listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since 1994, we have increased the dividend every year, growing dividends per share at a compound average annual growth rate of approximately 4.4%. And as a result, it's increasing the dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. We're proud to be a member of the exclusive S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which consists of only three REITs and 65 companies overall. Now I would like to hand our call back to Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. Before we open up the line for questions, I did want to provide a brief update on our pending merger with VEREIT. Our special shareholder meeting to approve the merger is scheduled for August 12, and we remain focused on the fourth quarter closing, subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions. As I hope you can all appreciate, we are limited in any incremental information we can provide related to the merger beyond what has already been publicly disclosed. In conclusion, we are energized and pleased with the momentum across all areas of our business, which is reflected in our updated earnings guidance and increased growth projections for the year. As we have proven, with greater size comes enhanced prospects for growth, and we look forward to continuing to execute on these initiatives to ultimately deliver favorable full cycle AFFO per share growth with minimal volatility. At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nate Crossett with Berenberg.
Nate Crossett: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to just touch on activity in the quarter and kind of the outlook for the year. Maybe you could kind of give some color on the mix of the deal flow in the quarter and what you're seeing for the balance of the year? How is it weighting industrial versus retail? Are there a number of portfolio deals in there? And then, if you could just touch on what you're seeing in terms of pricing, both in the U.S. and the UK. And then also, I was curious here if you had looked at any transactions in Continental Europe yet.
Sumit Roy: Nate, thank you for your questions. So I hope to attempt to answer all of them, but I might miss a few. In terms of our volume, look, this is a continuation of a theme that we started the year with. And as you might recall, Nate, January, we had come out with a very robust pipeline. We've already sourced year-to-date more than $40 billion. And clearly, at the run rate that we've been able to achieve over the last three quarters and year-to-date, you can have a sense for the robustness of the pipeline. And I think the biggest surprise for us has been our -- the volume that we've been able to generate in the UK, some of which sort of translated to what we were able to accomplish in the second quarter. But even if you look year-to-date, it's representing about 40% of acquisitions. And the quality of the product that we're continuing to see, the relationships that we've been able to establish and grow in the UK during a very short period over the last two years is a testament to why we feel very comfortable with having increased our acquisition guidance by another $1.25 billion given that we are clipping away at $1 billion. So in terms of the pipeline, we are very happy with what we are seeing. We are very comfortable with the product that we are seeing. And I think this is -- this trend is going to continue. In terms of the makeup, you might have seen that depending on the quarter, anywhere between 25% to 30% of what we are acquiring is industrial. In the second quarter, 15% of overall acquisition was industrial, largely driven by about 35% industrial in the U.S. And we -- again, on the relationship front have been able to make a fair amount of progress, are seeing acquisition opportunities, sometimes before it even hits the market and being able to try to get some of these transactions over the finish line with the relationships that we have developed. And I think you should expect to see this 15% to 25% of our volume coming from the industrial side of the equation in terms of asset type continue over the next few quarters. In terms of cap rate, look, it's a very aggressive market. I think in previous calls, I've mentioned that cap rates have continued to compress, tighten whatever the right word is. And it's -- I think it's a testament to certainly the type of products that we are pursuing, but more so to the fact that net lease is a very unique way of investing in real estate that is very specific. And as such, for the type of products that we pursue, we have continued to see cap rates compress. And by the way, this is across the spectrum on the credit curve. It's not just on the investment-grade side. In fact, I'd argue on the investment-grade side, the compression has been more muted on a relative basis versus what we have seen on the high-yield side of the equation. So -- and that trend is continuing, and we saw that in the second quarter as well. I believe on the industrial front, it has continued to tighten, but it has -- the speed with which it's tightening has certainly slowed down. And we're seeing products on the industrial side for well-located assets in the high 3% cap rate, low 4% ZIP code to, on the rare occasion, high 4%, low 5% ZIP code depending on location. On the retail side, it's a similar story for high-quality assets with long lease terms, good growth, you're seeing in the low 4% to low 5% ZIP code. And then if you're willing to compromise on lease term or growth rates or what have you, perhaps credit, you can see transactions transacting in the mid-5% to low 7% ZIP code. But the stuff that one buys in the high 6s, low 7%, that has credit profiles, lease terms, et cetera, that obviously has a much higher risk profile associated to it. So I don't know if I got all your questions in, Nate, but please let me know if I missed something.
Nate Crossett: No, I think that's good. I'm just also curious, have you guys looked at any transactions on Continental Europe yet?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Thank you. We certainly have, and this is something that I have touched on in some of my previous calls. We just haven't been able to get some of these transactions over the finish line, but we are very close. The success that we have accomplished in the UK is one that we are trying to mimic in similar geographies with similar risk profiles. And with every day, every week that goes by, we are getting ever so close to being able to report to you additional markets that we've been able to add, which will become incremental source of growth for our business. But the direct answer to your question is, yes, we continue to look at opportunities, and we've come pretty close, but haven't been able to get them all the finish line as of the end of the second quarter.
Nate Crossett: Okay. That’s it for me. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Nate.
Christie Kelly: Thanks, Nate.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.
Christie Kelly: Hi, Caitlin.
Caitlin Burrows: Hi, everyone. You historically mentioned one of the reasons the announced VEREIT is attractive is that by being larger, you can do some larger transactions without risking concentration increasing meaningfully. I think you referenced it again in the prepared remarks. So I also imagine that those kinds of deals take time to complete. I was wondering if you could comment on what the opportunity set is for something like that and how frequently you expect a deal of that nature could come up in the future. Is it something that could be like once a year or maybe never even happen? Just trying to understand how realistic something like that could be.
Sumit Roy: Yes. That's a very good question, Caitlin. Look, in terms of predicting what can happen in the future, some of what you see is publicly available. You have seen some large companies come out and say as part of their financing, sale leaseback is going to be a source of capital, and they've come out with multibillion dollar numbers. And those are the ones that are obvious, both you've seen that here in the U.S. and you've seen that in the UK as well, with some of the M&A work that happened and large sale-leaseback opportunities on the industrial front in one specific transaction in the UK and then there was a retail client here in the U.S. that has come out with something like that. But I think what we would like to be able to change is to proactively go and be a solution for transactions that may not be in the public eye. And given the fact that we will have the size and scale, it is more difficult for me to predict as to how many of those opportunities can we create. When you talk to large companies and you go in there and you say, "Oh, we can do -- we can take $1 billion of your real estate off the balance sheet." Sometimes that's not meaningful enough to engage in a conversation. I mean, here, we are talking about $70 million, $80 million, $100 million companies, and that sort of capital doesn't really move the needle for them. And so what we are very optimistic about is to be able to use our pro forma on larger scale to be able to have more aggressively some of these conversations that we started a few years ago. And the feedback that we had received was, oh, yes, thanks a lot, just not big enough for us to be meaningful to engage. And so I think those conversations, we hope to get over the finish line and create more opportunities. But Catlin, I can't sit here and tell you that there will be one or two of those transactions per year. I think we have to view those where we are generating those transactions on our own as opportunistic. And time will tell as to how many of those we can sort of get over the finish line. But even if you were to just look at the ones that are not opportunistic, the ones that are part of M&A capital strategies, you're starting to see a lot more today than you ever did in the past. And I've just referenced two transactions in the recent, call it, five months, six months period. I'm not trying to suggest that you should extrapolate that. But those types of transactions didn't see the light of day three years ago, four years ago. And so that's what gives us confidence that being a larger company will allow us to more proactively take advantage of these opportunities that present themselves and be that one-stop shop, which even with our current size, we sometimes fall short.
Caitlin Burrows: Got it. And then maybe just talking about on the tenant side, retailer bankruptcies have been pretty limited this year. Could you give some detail on the status of your watch list or maybe just more generally, your understanding of how your tenants are doing today?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Our watch list stands right around 4% currently, Caitlin. And again, what gives us a lot of confidence is if you look at our collection numbers in July, which we shared with you, it's about 99%. And some could argue over that 99% may have built in a lot of abatements and a reduction in rent that you might have passed on to clients. And I just want to make sure that we make it very clear that it doesn't. I mean, if you look at the numbers, and we've put this out publicly, if you look at the abatement number, it's about slightly more than $1 million on $1.6 billion of rent. So it's about 90 basis points is what we have -- not even actually, it's a lot less than that, what we have updated, and these are largely to smaller operators. So when we are collecting above 99% on rent that has largely not been abated, it's very similar to what we had pre-COVID that should be a testament to the credit profile of the tenants that we are exposed to, and that is by design. So we feel very good about where we are and especially with every month that goes by this continued optimism that we have in our ability to get back to pre-pandemic levels without having to give abatements, I think, is a testament to the credit quality of our operators.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Katie McConnell with Citi.
Katie McConnell: Now that your theater collections are becoming much more stabilized, can you talk about your approach to converting cash basis tenants back to the accrual method eventually and how we should think about potential timing of that?
Sumit Roy: Sure. Katie, if you wouldn't mind, I'll have Christie talk to that.
Christie Kelly: Certainly. Thanks, Sumit. Thanks, Katie. So essentially, Katie, we have very positive momentum as we've discussed in our theater industry collections. And as we look forward towards the end of the year, there are a couple of things that we're really watching. And first is going to be collection experience, and that is sustained and in accordance with our contractual and any deferral agreement. Second is in relation to that experience going into not only the third quarter but the fourth quarter to ensure that we have consistency, that we maintain momentum on collections and that we're able to report the 98% to 100% collections that we're expecting going forward with no additional reserves. And so CBD, we're booking and looking and reviewing as part of our routine every week, every month, and we'll have more to report after the third quarter.
Katie McConnell: Okay. Got it. And then could you discuss how your G&A needs could change in international markets of the UK portfolio continues to grow and as you start thinking about entering some new markets?
Sumit Roy: Sure. So Katie, part of the strategy we had was to use a combination of folks that we had in-house and some companies that we felt very comfortable with outsourcing to as third-party providers for services that we needed. And obviously, if we -- as our portfolio has grown and now it's about $2.7 billion in the UK, a lot of these third-party providers provide services that we can accommodate internally at margins that are superior to what we were getting outsourcing those particular functions. So as we have grown, we are bringing in-house more and more of these services. One of the other things that we are trying to look at and consider is as we grow into additional markets, and we believe that to be a matter of time, where is it that we should be domiciled, et cetera? And that work has -- we've made a tremendous amount of progress on that front as well. So before we bring in some of these functions in-house, we wanted to make sure that we were structured appropriately to accommodate our continued growth in Europe. And so there will be more to come on that front, but we will certainly be able to create synergies by bringing some of these outsourced services in-house. And it's largely going to be a function of where we ultimately decide to be headquartered to help support the European expansion. And -- but those discussions are ongoing, and we'll have more to report on that front as and when we establish our operations, et cetera.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.
Greg McGinniss: I want to talk about UK a little bit more. So the investment spread there is wider than what you've been able to achieve in the U.S. Is that just a function of plus competition? And then what are your thoughts on increasing your investment focus on that market since you started investing there, maybe targeting a higher percentage of UK versus U.S. asset than initially thought of?
Sumit Roy: So Greg, part of it was, if you looked at the first quarter, we were in the low 5s in terms of what we were able to accomplish in the UK It's a function of the asset types that we are able to get over the finish line as well as some of the operators that we pursue, the lease term, et cetera, et cetera. And we were hoping to actually close on a few transactions that were slightly more higher yielding in the first quarter that slipped into the second quarter, which is the primary reason for this higher cap rate. In terms of competition, every day that goes by, I'm exaggerating, of course, the competition in the UK is increasing. I think people have started to realize that, that is a market that affords good risk-adjusted returns. And so I don't see competition as being the dictate as to whether we should increase, decrease the quantum of transactions that we pursue in the UK. We have a very defined -- clearly defined strategy in the UK And if there are transactions that we see, if they meet those particular criteria, we pursue it and we pursue it aggressively. And I think that's what's going to dictate the amount of volume. Now clearly, the volume has increased, and part of it is because it took us a while to establish ourselves, establish our name and establish those -- the reputation that we have and the relationships that we've built. But if there are opportunities and more opportunities to -- if the volume of opportunities increase, you can totally see us increasing the amount of acquisitions that we get over the finish line in the UK But we're going to be very true to our strategy that we laid out, and that's not to say it's a static strategy that doesn't get looked at, and it doesn't get added to or subtracted from. It's just something that we spend a lot of time first figuring out what is the right product to pursue and then react to that strategy that we have thoughtfully laid out for ourselves. So it could be volume of acquisitions increase as more and more products start to come to the fourth. For sure, it could. Is competition increasing? Yes. But I think the way for us to think about our international strategy is to think in terms of newer markets to continue to add to the volume of overall acquisitions, not necessarily do more in a given location.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. And then to help us better understand the hurdles to additional investment opportunities in Europe, what enables you to more quickly accomplish the goal of finding significant investment opportunities in the UK getting those deals across the finish line in Continental Europe?
Sumit Roy: Part of it was pricing. It got so aggressive. These were transactions that met a lot of our strategic objectives that we had laid out. But there's just a lot of capital that is chasing these deals, like I said. And when it got to a point where it didn't make economic sense for us to continue to pursue, we backed away. And I think that has largely been the reason why we haven't sort of gotten into some of the other markets. But I will say that as we have become more visible in given geographies, just like we did in the UK, people are getting familiar with our names. And so there might have been transactions that we might not have seen two years ago or 1.5 years ago, that we are now seeing because people understand that we -- they understand what we were able to do in the UK That reputation has translated to Continental Europe. And the fact that we have pursued a few transactions has obviously led credence to our ability and our desire to grow our portfolio in those particular markets. And I think that is translating into the flow that you need to get into to establish a particular market. And so we are very optimistic that over the next few quarters, you will start to see us expand into other markets outside of the UK
Greg McGinniss: All right. If you won't mind, just a quick follow-up there based on that response. Are you -- is it fair to say that you're seeing more competition than in Continental Europe versus the UK?
Sumit Roy: I wouldn't say it's more than in the UK What I would say is the pricing could be the folks -- the capital markets environment in Continental Europe versus the UK is different. And that translates into a more aggressive pricing environment at times. And so, we're going to be very disciplined at, Greg. And if we don't feel like it makes sense on a risk-adjusted basis, we are not going to pursue it just for the sake of expanding into new markets. But having said all of that, I'm very optimistic about being able to add to our UK expansion in the near term.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: Just wanted to go back to the UK cap rates, the jump that we saw there in the past quarter. I'm curious did you enter any new markets within the UK, like, say, Scotland? And then maybe can you comment on what the expectation should be near term? Or how are you thinking about cap rates in the UK near term? Will it be closer to 5% like last quarter or 6% perhaps closer to the new norm?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So Haendel, when you say UK, we've been looking at transactions in Scotland, Wales and England. Those are the three countries that we focused on. So the fact that we have closed on a particular transaction, and I don't recall off the top of my head whether we did or we didn't, is not new. We -- from the time we've gone into the UK, we've been looking at all three countries -- not Northern Island yet, just to be clear. The cap rate is really a function of what gets closed in a given quarter handle. As you know, the industrial market is trade at lower cap rates, especially if it has the lease term, et cetera. And it's a similar story on the retail front as well. Perhaps it's slightly higher than the industrial side, but not that much higher, especially if it has lease term and it's with one of the top three operators, top four operators on the grocery side of the business. So it really is a question of whether it's industrial or retail. Within retail, is it grocery or home improvement? What is the duration of the lease term? All of that goes into the mix to define what the cap rate is. And yes, within the three countries as well, there is a slight discrepancy in terms of cap rates, what a similar asset would trade in Scotland versus in England. But it's a function of all of those various factors that go into what the cap rate is for a given transaction. And we have, like I have said before, a very clearly defined strategy. And depending on what gets over the finish line that translates to the cap rates that we've shared. So this particular quarter, it was about 6%. And in the first quarter, it was in the low 5s. So it blended out to -- in the mid to high 5% cap rates, which I think is what one should expect going forward.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Appreciate that. And one more, just again, fully understanding there's a lot of sensitivity regarding matters pertaining to the merger, the pending merger with VEREIT. But there's been some confusion amongst the number of users we talked to you about the 10% accretion target you outlined for the merger. So maybe can you just clarify for us the 10% accretion. Is that before or after the office portfolio spin-off that you're doing concurrently with the merger?
Sumit Roy: Yes. The 10% is the overall system accretion. It is inclusive of the office assets. It's inclusive of the entire company. And that's the extent of the comments I'm going to make. I think you can look at the investor deck that we had put out that walks you through the mechanics of what that 10% really entails. But if you look at these two companies and you have one company buying another company, what is the accretion, it's 10%. That's how you should think about it, actually, not 10%.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.
Ronald Kamdem: Just two quick ones for me. The first, I think you talked about historically in the past, given how well the portfolio did during COVID that there was potential to look at maybe higher-yielding, slightly higher risk assets on the acquisition side. Just curious what -- is that still something that you guys are thinking about in bringing the strategy? Is that still something that's being contemplated?
Sumit Roy: Ronald, yes, it's absolutely part and parcel of our strategy. We play across the risk spectrum and the credit spectrum. And so just because something is high yielding doesn't necessarily always mean that it has risk associated with it, for which you are not getting paid. But we don't find those very often. I'll also go ahead and say that. And -- but if we do, and it just happens to have a high 6% cap rate associated with it, and the fact that we have certain competencies on our asset management and leasing side of the equation, which we believe are true competencies that are -- that make us based on some of the results that we've shared, we feel a lot better about being able to pursue those opportunities. And the more assets that we reposition, et cetera, the better we are able to underwrite some of the risk that's inherent in the high-yielding opportunities that we see. And so as we continue to build on our competency of repositioning assets and being able to generate spreads that are north of what the existing spreads were, I think we will look at more higher-yielding opportunities. But it's -- they don't come very often, but it's certainly part of our strategy, Ronald.
Ronald Kamdem: And then the second question was just going back, I think you talked a little bit about cap rate compression in the sort of both in the industrial as well as in the retail. So maybe just can you, again, compare and contrast. Obviously, industrial has been sort of very competitive. It sounds like the cap rate compression has moderated relative to the retail. Just curious if those comments are captured accurate, if you can provide a little bit more color there?
Sumit Roy: So Ronald, it's a long -- the range of cap rates that I've shared with you that we are seeing in the market on assets that we are pursuing, I do think that where we have seen compression, the retail assets continue to compress more today than the industrial assets. But we hear stories of certain transactions that happen at cap rates that we've never seen before, but I would consider that to be one-off. But it is a question of a lot of capital chasing the same set of products that we find ourselves interested in. And that has resulted in the environment that we find ourselves. Having said all of that, we are still generating -- in the second quarter, we generated over 170 basis points in spread, which is better than our average spread over the duration of our history of acquiring assets. So even in this environment, we are very competitive and we are able to grow our portfolio and generate above average spreads. So we feel very good about where we are. But I don't think that it's a sustainable environment where cap rates continue to compress, especially if it's -- funny I say this, but the 10 year trading in the 1 15, 1 16 ZIP Code, but where the expectation is that inflation should come in and interest rates at some point will start to go back up, I think that's going to be the floor for this continued compression. But we are starting to see some level of stabilization, certainly on the industrial side.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts with UBS.
Brent Dilts: In the transaction market for theater assets, are you seeing any buyers up here yet or any sellers actively marketing properties as rent collection rates improve? We saw the recent AMC deal for the two Pacific theater properties, but just wondering more broadly what you're seeing in the market there?
Sumit Roy: I think, Brent, what AMC was able to do is largely along the lines of what their CEO has suggested to the market that they now are sitting on plenty of capital where they can play offense and where they see opportunities with assets that are well located but the operator is no longer there or is in a distressed situation, they're going out and buying out the operators. And that I think is very prudent. We haven't been in the market trying to sell our assets or anything like that. We had a thesis that we have shared with you and with the market about the theater business as an industry. We've also shared with you that the assets that we believe we have tend to be very well located and in terms of performance are in the top two quartiles a vast majority of our assets. And so our expectations have always been that this business will come back and we will start to collect 100% of our rent, and that our operators will start to pay back some of the deferred rent, which in one case has already started. But I did see some news around assets having traded and I think it might have been one of our peer companies that sold a couple of layer assets. But we really are not playing in the market rent. For us, it was more of about in the off chance that we do get some of these assets back, how can we reposition them. And I think I've made comments in the past around our confidence in being able to reposition some of these assets just given their location and given the demand for alternative use. But we haven't been looking to buy more assets nor have we been looking to sell any of our theater asset. So can't really comment on that outside of what I saw in the press.
Brent Dilts: And then just a clarification maybe on the guidance for this year. Does the revision for your guidance -- could you just clarify what is assumed on the recovery of deferred rents from the theater tenants versus your prior assumptions?
Sumit Roy: We haven't changed -- yes, go ahead, Christie…
Christie Kelly: I was just going to say that as it relates to the guidance, Brent, essentially, we're expecting as we move forward that we continue to incur and experienced positive rent collections similar to the trends that we've been seeing increased through the second quarter and consistent with the experience in July.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies.
Linda Tsai: I apologize, another cap rate question, but in terms of the larger sale leasebacks for retail and industrial. How do the cap rates on these deals compare to your regular one-off acquisitions?
Sumit Roy: Well, we haven't really seen one of those larger transactions here in the US actually transact, so I can't really comment on that, Linda. But traditionally, we had always seen a discount on the portfolio transactions vis-a-vis what you see in the one-off market. And my expectation would be that in order to facilitate multibillion dollar sale leaseback transactions that that discount will continue to be there vis-a-vis the one-off markets, but time will tell. We certainly have seen a compression on that discount but I believe that there will have to be a discount in order for an institutional buyer like ourselves to continue to engage. Otherwise, what's the difference? We could pick these assets off in the one-off market and we certainly have the infrastructure to do that. So that's my belief.
Linda Tsai: And then you discussed before the superior cost of capital in the UK versus the US. What's the differential like currently and do you view it as sustainable?
Sumit Roy: So I mean, on the cost of equity, obviously, it's the same. It's really the cost of debt that we see a major difference. You saw what we were able to do on the green bond issuance. I think it priced out at about 1.48% all in. If we were to do a similar issuance here in the US, I think the delta would be 30 to 40 basis points, maybe even larger. Now obviously, the environment today is very different from when we went to the market. But nevertheless, I saw a quote not just too long ago on a 10 year unsecured bond, it was 1.95, 1.98. And we got August, a nine year weighted average on the bond issuance that we just did, and that was at 1.48. So yes, that 50 basis point delta continues to be there. And that's really the advantage that we have, that we have assets, that could be financed with capital being raised locally. And so that's where the cost of capital advantage comes in.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.
John Massocca: So I guess touching back on the industrial investment platform again. And did I hear you correctly, it seems like at the beginning of the call, you were kind of indicating that maybe you're looking to -- I know you've historically always been in industrial, but maybe you can further grow that platform? And if so, I mean, how has your kind of underwriting on industrial assets changed over the years? I mean, maybe this is a misconception on my part, but I've always kind of thought of your industrial investments being primarily kind of high investment grade rated tenants on long kind of lease term. Has there been any push into areas that maybe have shorter duration leases, maybe some of the more, I guess, less name brand tenants in an industrial asset? Just anything on that front and how that platform is evolving.
Sumit Roy: So John, I think we've been asked this question around our industrial portfolio and what is the allocation that we would like to see in an optimal portfolio, and we've said circa 20%. Today, we are right around 12%. So our desire is to grow that asset type to the 20% ZIP code. So I don't think your question is around why are we doing it. I think you prefaced your question by saying we have been in industrial. So I think that hasn't changed. Obviously, as we have underwritten industrial assets now for over 10 years, I think our first investment was in 2010, 2011 time frame We have evolved in terms of being able to take on assets that may have only nine years left on a lease rather than what we used to feel comfortable around doing 10 years ago, which was 15 year leases or 20 year leases and potentially doing it only through the sale leaseback channels rather than providing capital for takeouts, et cetera. And so clearly, on the lease term, we are very comfortable taking on high single digit, mid single digit lease terms, if we can get very comfortable with the market and inherent rent and what the price per square feet is for given assets and what the market can looks like on future rental growth, as well as alternative tenants that could step in. And if that allows us to pursue some transactions, we will absolutely do that. We are very proud of our industrial asset management team. And we share with you the renewals and the releases that we have on a blended basis. And those types of numbers have continued to give us confidence to grow our business and to grow our platform, and to bring in more and more people along with the team that we already have. That's very comfortable playing across the lease term, playing across the credit spectrum, et cetera. Having said all of that, we are still predominantly investment grade. But we are very comfortable playing across the credit spectrum on the industrial side, if we believe it's well located with good real estate metrics associated with it.
John Massocca: And then on the balance sheet side, obviously, the UK debt issuance was a green bond. I guess maybe kind of both in the UK and in the US, what's the opportunity set there for more kind of green bond issuance? And I guess what are the advantages essentially from a pricing perspective versus the non-green bond.
Sumit Roy: Christie?
Christie Kelly: Essentially, one of the aspects of green bond is there is some slight, if you will, favorability associated with the overall rate. I mean based on our research and tracking, it's about 10 basis points, but it's really more than that. It's really about making a statement as it relates to our ESG initiatives and as well, putting a framework out there that really allows us to partner with our clients and doing the right thing as we focus on reducing our carbon footprint. And as we go forward, yes, green bond is something that we're interested in. One of the things that we had talked about in our prepared remarks is the fact that the bond that we executed have about 40% fulfillment as it relates to real estate that meets the criteria. We're focused on completing that, not only with acquisitions that we execute in the UK and eventually potentially on the continent, but also in the US. And we think it's a great vehicle for us to move forward with not only from a liability management perspective and driving competitive weighted average cost of capital, but as I mentioned before, just doing the right thing, allowing us to partner in the right way with our clients to make a difference.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.
Chris Lucas: So Sumit, just a couple of quick questions for you. Just on the merger with VEREIT. Can you just give us a sense of what are the hurdles left to get through and maybe the expected timing? You mentioned the shareholder vote next week. I'm assuming there's other things that need to get done that push the expected completion date sometime fourth quarter.
Sumit Roy: So Chris, I'm very limited and constrained in terms of what I can talk about with respect to the merger. All I can tell you is we are right on schedule. One of the biggest hurdles, as you said, is our shareholder vote next week on the 12 -- well, it's on August 12. And then we -- if you look at our agreements, et cetera, I think you'll see a couple of other conditions that have been laid out, but we feel very comfortable, and we are on schedule so far. So I think by the third quarter, we'll have a lot more to share with you. And so if I can just ask you to be a bit patient, a bit more patient, I'd appreciate it.
Chris Lucas: And then I guess just on the significant bump in acquisition guidance. Is there any large portfolio transactions that are embedded in that number that we should be aware of?
Sumit Roy: No, Chris. Nothing out of the ordinary. It's just a very healthy pipeline. It's exactly the type of product that you would expect Realty Income to pursue. So no large portfolios are part of this guidance.
Chris Lucas: And then last question and maybe for Christie, just on the significant ramp in theater rent collections. Was there anything in your relationship with them that sort of drove that or was it just as random as they just decided to pay you in July…
Christie Kelly: As you can imagine, Chris, we're in close contact with our theater clients and have been so since the beginning of the pandemic and even beyond that. But as you've seen, I mean their liquidity position has improved significantly. Essentially, all theaters are open. And with that, we've had some great results at the box office. So that's all translating to improved collections together with the fact that we hold essentially the best assets. And so with that, we're working in partnership. We expect to be paid in full, as Sumit said, from the abatement activity, et cetera, very immaterial and nothing in relation to our theater clients. And moving forward, we are continuing to partner. We're focused on getting paid in full and that's the manner in which we're going forward. So nothing magic [Multiple Speakers]…
Chris Lucas: Last question for me, just on the deferral repayment schedule. Have you guys outlined sort of what the cadence of that is expected to be?
Christie Kelly: I think we've talked about it in general, Chris. And suffice it to say that as it relates to deferrals, we're not at liberty to talk about any one client. But overall, I can explain to you our strategy and essentially, it's to get paid back in full here in the near term. Essentially, any of our deferral arrangements are spanning, call it, a year to 18 months out. We're expected to get paid back in terms of average deferral period within seven months. And as a matter of fact, some of our clients are paying us back early. And so overall, great job done by the team and again, good partnership with our clients.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Spenser Allaway with Green Street.
Spenser Allaway: As it relates to dispositions in the quarter, most of your asset sales were vacant assets. So can you just comment on the market for these assets? And would you say it's harder to offload your vacant assets today than it was pre-COVID, just given the additional headwinds in the market?
Sumit Roy: Spencer, actually, again, it's the exact opposite. If you look at the second quarter and you look at the resolutions, we were able to pick up 50 basis points essentially from where we were in terms of occupancy at the end of the first quarter versus the second quarter from 98% to 98.5%. It's largely a testament to what we were able to do on the asset sales side and these are vacant asset sales. I think we had close to 40 resolutions on that front. And then if you look at what the return profile has been, it continues to be year-to-date in that 8% plus unlevered returns. So I think it again goes back to where we buy assets, how fungible are these assets. If not for retenanting purposes to sell it vacant and still be able to capture returns that are well in excess of our long-term weighted average cost of capital. So we've been very successful and part of it is a testament to the team that we have in place. And we haven't seen any drop off, in fact, during this COVID-related downturn that we are coming out of. And I would go so far as to say that our speed, our ability to execute more transactions has continued to increase quarter-over-quarter. So that's the reason why we are so proud of being able to get to 98.5% despite suffering NPC's bankruptcy in the fourth quarter where we were handed back 70 odd assets, and we were able to get right back to that 98.5% ZIP code within two quarters. So we feel very good about our team and our ability to continue to take advantage of the market.
Spenser Allaway: And it looks like you sold at least one office asset. Can you just comment on that property type in the market for those assets right now, and especially for assets with low lease term?
Sumit Roy: I don't want to speak to specifics, Spencer, because we have NDAs, et cetera. But rest assured that was an asset where if we had discussions with the tenant and it was deemed better to sell it back and move forward. And again, on that particular asset, our overall return profile was well in advance of what we captured for the second quarter. So we feel very good about those opportunistic sales. There is no secret. We've already mentioned that we are not in -- I mean, office is not a long term asset type that we want to be exposed to. And we get these one-off opportunities to take advantage of them.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Elvis Rodriguez with Bank of America.
Elvis Rodriguez: Just a quick one on strategy. Sumit, as you think about acquiring these larger portfolios and the sale leaseback deals, how do you think about like the assets you want to keep versus the assets you want to shed in terms of spinning them out versus an outright sale?
Sumit Roy: So Alves, that's part of what we do across our portfolio pretty much on a daily basis. It's not just when we are buying large sale leaseback transactions. I mean, obviously, we are somewhat constrained being a REIT. You have holding period requirements, et cetera. But in the past, when we have done large sale leasebacks or larger sale leasebacks, there were some assets that we bought into our TRS primarily with the intent of managing our exposure to the tenant. And so that has always been part of our strategy and will continue to be part of our strategy going forward. So nothing new there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.
Greg McGinniss: Just a quick follow-up again. Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. So there was a lot of movement on the convenience store side of things this quarter with 7-Elevens, Circle-K, [BWA] and GPM kind of shifting around top tenant list. Just curious there were maybe some trades between those tenants, that was impacting that. And then in terms of increasing exposure to 7-Eleven, was that a deal that maybe you may not have pursued without the pending VEREIT merger or are you comfortable with 6% exposure to certain tenants?
Sumit Roy: Well, not too long ago, we had 7% exposure to Walgreens. And now as you noticed, Greg, that has, over time, dwindled down to 7.5%. The biggest movement on the 7-Eleven transaction was that they closed on their Speedway transaction. And you might recall, we used to have, I don't know how many assets, but we were exposed to Speedway. And so once they closed on it, it's obviously now under 7-Eleven and that's what shows an increase in the 7-Eleven tenant client exposure. Then you might have noticed that on the Circle K, Couche-Tard side that went lower, and it's primarily because they sold some of the assets that were our assets to KC. And so that's the reason for some of the Couche-Tard concentration to be reduced from what you had seen in the previous quarter. So that's really what's happening. It's not us going out and doing transactions or what have you. Having said that, if transactions were to be available, we would absolutely pursue it. And we are very comfortable with individual clients representing 6%, 7%, not across the board but for certain clients, we are absolutely very comfortable with that. And 7-Eleven is definitely one of them.
Greg McGinniss: And just a final one for me kind of following up on Spencer's question on dispositions. So past quarter was, I guess, the largest number of vacant dispositions in years. Was that just due to the NPC vacancies or is there any other particular tenant or industry type for those assets? And then any color you can provide on the re-leasing or repositioning attempts on those assets would be appreciated as well, because obviously, you showed success in the other re-leasing numbers this quarter.
Sumit Roy: So Greg, this is part of our asset management strategy. Obviously, we are very comfortable holding on to assets. It's not like we are trying to manage to an occupancy number. But there is an analysis that we go through figuring out what is the holding cost, what is the re-leasing scenario look like, how long is that going to take, is there going to be capital contribution, are we better off selling it for whatever it is that we are able to get, what's the return profile looks like in a re-leasing scenario versus a sale scenario today. And once you look at the mix, you pursue a particular strategy, and that's largely what's driving the decision making process. And what we found was, yes, that some of the assets that we sold actually were the bankrupt assets that we got back from NPC. They were in high demand but not for re-lease. They were in high demand with folks that wanted to buy these assets outright. And when you look at the return profile, it was superior to us holding it and trying to find a new client that could step into those assets. Having said that, there are some assets that we actually re-leased to new clients as well. So it's a combination of strategies that we execute but the underlying premise and the goal has always been what is going to maximize our returns and whatever that answer is that it's selling it vacant versus finding a new tenant, that's dictated by this return profile.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I would now like to turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.
Sumit Roy: Well, thank you very much, and I look forward to coming back to you shortly. Bye-bye.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This concludes Realty Income Second Quarter 2021 Operating Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-04 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income First Quarter 2021 Operating Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now hand the conference over to your speaker today, Julie Hasselwander, Investor Relations at Realty Income. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Julie Hasselwander: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. During this conference call, we will certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that cause such differences in the Company's form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call-in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may re-enter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. The continued strength of our business is made possible by the incredible partnerships we have with all stakeholders. I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to our Realty Income team who continues to effectively execute our strategic objectives while enduring a sustained, remote work environment. As we've announced last week, we are excited to have reached a definitive merger agreement with VEREIT, which would further distance ourselves as a leader in the net lease industry and create a company with a combined enterprise value of approximately $50 billion. We believe shareholders of both companies will enjoy meaningful value creation through immediate earnings accretion and expanded platform with enhanced size, scale and diversification, driving further growth opportunities, and strategic and financing synergies which are enhanced by Realty Income's A rated balance sheet and access to well-priced capital. We are very excited about the strategic transaction and look forward to continuing to drive future growth together as a combined enterprise. However, today we will focus on what was a very successful first quarter for Realty Income. Our first quarter results illustrate our ability to grow through a variety of swim lanes afforded to us by our size and scale by completing over $1 billion in acquisitions. Notably, in this quarter, we invested approximately $403 million in high quality real estate in the UK, highlighting the continued strength of our international platform and bringing that total investment in the UK to over $2 billion since the first international acquisitions we closed in 2019. Domestically, we invested $625 million in real estate, including our first ever acquisition in Hawaii, becoming the first and only REIT to own property in all US states. Our accomplishments during the quarter continue to demonstrate the momentum in our business, and highlight our ability to leverage our size and scale to drive our business forward in pursuit of sustainable growth. On the subject of sustainable growth, our team continues to make tremendous progress through our ESG initiative, as ESG considerations continue to permeate throughout our organization at every level. In April, we published our inaugural Sustainability Report, which details our company's commitments, goals and progress to-date with regard to environmental, social, and government initiatives. I invite all Realty Income stakeholders to share in our dedication to embrace the changing world for the benefit of all those we serve. And I encourage everyone listening to read our 2020 Sustainability Report found on the corporate responsibility page of our website. Additionally, we are excited to share an updated investor presentation to the marketplace. On the homepage of our website, you can find our new deck, which highlights our fundamental business philosophies, key competitive advantages, and plan for future growth. Turning to results for the quarter, our global investment pipeline remains a significant driver of growth for our business. Our business is simple. We seek to acquire high quality real estate lease to leading operators in economically resilient industries in pursuit of stable and increasing cash flow generation. Our confidence in continuing to grow our platform stems from the quality of our real estate portfolio, which is designed for resiliency through a variety of economic environments. Key to mitigating economic risk, we believe in portfolio diversification by geography, client, industry and property type as we continue to grow our real estate portfolio. In the first quarter of 2021, we invested over $1 billion in high quality real estate and we remain very comfortable with our 2021 acquisition guidance of over $3.25 billion. On a total revenue basis, approximately 39% of total acquisitions during the quarter are leased to investment grade rated clients, which brings our total investment grade client exposure for the portfolio to approximately 50%. Aligning with our equals, the weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 12.6 years. And at the end of the quarter, the weighted average lease term of our total portfolio was 8.9 years. As at quarter end, our real estate portfolio includes over 600 clients who operate in 56 different industries. Approximately 84% of rental revenue comes from our traditional retail properties, while industrial properties generated about 11% of rental revenue. With regard to our retail business, we seek to invest in industries with a service non-discretionary and or low price point component of the business, as we believe these characteristics make for economically resilient operation that can more effectively compete with e-commerce. As such of our acquisitions during the quarter, the largest industry represented were grocery stores. Walgreens remains our largest client at 5.5% of rental revenue, and convenience stores remain our largest industry at 12% of rental revenue. Our investment philosophy primarily focuses on acquiring freestanding single unit commercial properties leased to best-in-class clients under long-term net lease agreements typically in excess of 10 years. We believe the market is efficient. As such, we've seen a competitive environment for high quality assets leased to strong operators. Cap rates, as you all know, reflect an aggregation of many factors including but not limited to fundamental real estate economics, lease term, credit of the client or their sponsor, rent relative to the market, average rent coverage by the operator and alternative use of the real estate. Accordingly, the quality of our acquisitions is reflected in our average initial cash cap rate during the first quarter of 5.3%. Our size and scale allow us to be highly selective in pursuing investment opportunities that fit our stringent criteria. This quarter we sourced nearly $20 billion of transaction opportunities, ultimately investing in approximately 5% of the prospects sourced and reviewed. Additionally, our cost of capital allows us to invest accretively even when pursuing the highest quality assets. During the first quarter our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were 115 basis points. The quality of the assets we acquire flows through the entire lifecycle of our portfolio, allowing us to basically recapture rent on expiring leases and maintain a healthy level of occupancy. During the quarter, we re-leased 54 units, re-capturing 103.5% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3600 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, re-capturing over 100% of rent on those re-leased contracts, and occupancy at quarter end was 98%. Our size and scale afford us the ability to execute large scale sale leaseback transactions which are often sourced through existing partnerships with best-in-class clients, but also serve as an attractive way to establish new relationships. The transaction we closed in Hawaii is an excellent example of the sale leaseback opportunities we can execute. In this instance, we partnered with Par Petroleum to acquire 22 well located convenience stores for approximately $116 million. All 22 properties fall under one triple net master lease agreement with an initial 15-year lease term. And all assets are located in many main locations, primarily on the island of O'ahu. This quarter, about 24% of all acquisitions we close were executed as sale leaseback transactions. The merger between Realty Income and VEREIT will enhance our ability to execute large scale leaseback transactions through expanded capacity to buy in bulk, which improve our competitive positioning when competing for portfolio or sale leaseback transactions in the fragmented net lease industry. As we have previously articulated, the ability to buy at wholesale prices and at a discount to the one-off market is a competitive advantage. We are often one of only a handful of buyers for large scale portfolio transactions, particularly those that would otherwise create untenable client or industry concentration issues for our competitors. Proforma for the closing of the transaction, we will have approximately $2.5 billion of annualized rental revenue. For every $1 billion of acquisition to a single creditor industry, our exposure to that creditor industry will increase by approximately 2% compared to around 3.5% based on our current size. By leveraging our size and scale, we continue to effectively execute through our international platform. We have healthy acquisition volume in the UK. Fundamentally, we are replicating our U.S. business strategy, seeking to curate a high-quality real estate portfolio leased to leading operators in economically resilient industries. Our total first quarter acquisition volume improved approximately $403 million of international acquisitions in the UK, which brings us total investment volume to more than $2 billion since the first transaction we closed in the UK in 2019. Our International pipeline has accelerated even more quickly than originally anticipated. This quarter's International acquisition volume represents nearly 40% of our total investment volume during the quarter. A figure that is truly incremental to the U.S. business and one that we expect to grow. Now I'll pass it over to Christie to provide financial updates.
Christie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. I'll start with some high-level background and then move into our financial results for the quarter. We're the only net lease REIT from the S&P 500, one of the top 10 largest U.S. REITs by enterprise value and the largest company in the net lease REIT sector. Upon closing our recently announced merger with VEREIT, Realty Income is expected to be the sixth largest REIT in the [ph] RMZ in terms of equity market capitalization. Our size and scale, in conjunction with our conservative balance sheets and financial strength have afforded us to a credit rating by the major rating agencies and our $3 billion multi-currency revolver grants us ample access to well-priced capital that allows us to opportunistically raise permanent long-term capital when the markets are most favorable. During the quarter, we raised approximately $670 million through an overnight equity offering to reduce our financing risk by pre-funding our active global investment pipeline. In January 2021, we completed the early redemption of all $950 million, 3.25% notes due in 2022 to take advantage of attractive borrowing rates in the fixed income market, while reducing our near-term financing risks. This redemption was primarily funded through our December issuance of $725 million of senior unsecured notes through a dual tranche offering of a five year and 12-year note, which achieved record low U.S. dollar coupon rates in the REIT sector for each of those tenors. As a result, our fixed charge coverage ratio, I'm pleased to report, has hit an all-time high at 5.8 times this quarter. We believe funding our business with approximately two-thirds equity and one-third debt contributes to maintaining a conservative balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.3 times or 5.2 times on a proforma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our near-term debt maturities remain minimal, with only $26 million of debt maturing through year end 2021 excluding our commercial paper program and borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility. At the end of the first quarter, we had full availability of our $3 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility, $675 million outstanding under our $1 billion commercial paper program, and over $184 million of cash on hand, providing approximately $2.5 billion of liquidity available to capitalize on our active global investment pipeline. During the quarter, our business generated $0.86 cents of AFFO per share and we are maintaining our 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.44 to $3.49 on a standalone Realty Income basis unadjusted for the expected merger. Remember, we currently have 37 of our 79 Theater assets on cash accounting. These 37 theaters represent about $25.5 million dollars of annual rent remaining in 2021. And we've reserved $33.2 million as allowance for bad debt on these assets, net of $1.9 million of straight-line rent receivables. In total, this $58.7 million translates to approximately $0.15 that is not currently included in AFFO per share guidance. We are encouraged by the recent momentum in the theatre space, such as increased nationwide opening and the release of blockbuster films. Most recently, Godzilla versus Cong brought in approximately $49 million during the opening weekend, five days specifically Wednesday to Sunday, and generated more than $390 million in revenue within the first two weeks of its global release, turning a profit of more than $200 million. However, until we are confident these particular theaters can continue to pay us contractual rent. We will continue to recognize revenue for these 37 theatres on a cash basis. As the monthly dividend company, we would be remiss not to discuss the dividends when providing business results. In April, we declared our 610th consecutive monthly dividends and we now increase the dividend 110 times since our listing in the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since 1994, we have increased the dividend every year growing dividends per share at a compound average annual growth rate of approximately 4.4%. And as a result of increasing the dividend every year for the past 25 consecutive years, we are proud to be a member of the exclusive S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index which consists of only three REIT and 65 companies overall. I would now like to hand our call back to Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. Our first quarter results continue to highlight the incredible opportunities afforded to us by our size and scale, which uniquely position us to be the global consolidator in a highly fragmented net leased space. And we believe the very merger will enhance our positioning to be just that. Our positive results as well as our powerful business momentum and in strong outlook energize our talented team to continue expanding our existing verticals, while finding new swim lanes through which the business can grow. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank.
Greg McGinniss: Hey Sumit. The VEREIT acquisition has dramatically increased your exposure to casual dining tenants to 7% of ABR, which is an industry where other REITs seem to be limiting exposure. What makes you comfortable with acquiring all those tenants?
Sumit Roy: That's certainly an area that we spent a fair amount of time focusing on Greg, when we were looking at VEREIT. The biggest contributor to that 7% is Red Lobster. And looking at where Red Lobster is today versus even where it was a year ago, gave us a fair amount of confidence that Red Lobster has turned the corner from being privately equity owned to being owned by a company out of Thailand Thai Union. And the credit enhancements that it achieved, the results that it is now posting, the fact that it gave --that it paid 100% of the rent in the fourth quarter to VEREIT. All of that gave us confidence that it's turned the corner and being vertically integrated organization, such as Thai Union is made us feel like 7% is a number that we can live with. But the goal here Greg will be over time to continue to reduce that, just like we did with our casual dining concept which used to be in the high single digits. And today represent less than 3% of our overall registry. And that will be the goal with on a proforma basis being up to 7% continuing to reduce that back down into the low single digits.
Greg McGinniss: Okay, thank you. Second question, given less concern about tenant concentration issues following the VEREIT merger, are there portfolios in the marketplace today that you now feel more comfortable pursuing? Are those types of portfolios already considered in acquisition guidance? And then how much volume do you think those types of portfolios could potentially contribute to acquisition each year?
Sumit Roy: Yeah, there's a bunch of questions you've asked there, Greg. The question is, we've talked about how proforma for this acquisition, it allows us to pursue larger transactions. I will say that you don't have multibillion dollar transactions coming in every week. But when you do, they can be a step growth, opportunity, just like a consolidation is in our industry. But given our size today, doing a multibillion-dollar transaction, we were somewhat constrained, pursuing that even if it checked all the other boxes, i.e. we like the credit, we like the operator, we like the industry, we like the makeup of the real estate, we like the rent composition, et cetera, et cetera. You feel constrained, just given how much of your portfolio concentration gets impacted by a single tenant. But once you start to increase your platform, the ability to absorb larger transactions, when they present themselves, certainly enhances. And there have been opportunities and I don't want to get into details, when even in the past 12 months, there have been opportunities to pursue transactions, where given, everything that we have relationship, to check the boxes across the spectrum we were still constrained by the allocation that we had to be able to pursue this particular transaction single-handedly. And those are the types of constraints that do get alleviated, the larger your platform becomes. And it does allow you to be able to present yourself as a one stop shop for some of these very well capitalized businesses that you want to continue to be their one stop shop, which we have been in this one example that I'm referencing. So, yeah, I do think that, post this consolidation, that it will enhance our position to pursue transactions that we were, somewhat constrained to do so in our current size and scale.
Greg McGinniss: Thanks, Sumit.
Operator: Your next question comes from Katy McConnell from Citi.
Katy McConnell: Hi there.
Sumit Roy: Hi Katy.
Katy McConnell: Could you update us on the portfolio of office assets that you plan to spin off with the merger? And now that the deals out in the open what have you been able to gauge as far as buyer interest in your ability to potentially sell those off instead?
Sumit Roy: Kate, it's been three business days since we made the announcement. But thank you for asking the question. Yeah, look, we've been pleasantly surprised by the inbounds. We're still in the process of collecting those inbounds and trying to figure out what's real from what's not real? We have been very clear that the path that we control is the spin off path. To answer your question more directly, it's essentially all of our office assets along with the vast majority of the of the VEREIT office assets outside of the six assets that are constrained by a CMBS pool, which is cross collateralized across multiple asset types. So outside of the six, our goal would be to basically spin off all of the remaining assets, which is right around 97 properties, $182 million $183 million in rent, weighted average lease term circa 4, 76% 77% investment grade tenants. That's the makeup of the portfolio. But as we had thought would happen, once we announced there have been inbound calls, we are just gathering the information, but it is still too early to tell what's real from what's not. We are going to continue down the path that we control. And if something were to happen in the meantime, that's great. But it's too early to tell.
Katy McConnell: Okay I appreciate that color. And then can you talk a little more about the decision to just enter the Hawaii market now? And whether you all want to increase the scale there more meaningfully or potentially pursue any industrial opportunities there?
Sumit Roy: Yeah, Katy, it's just, it's not something we intentionally pursued in this particular quarter. We've always, two CEOs ago, Tom was from Hawaii. And the inside joke was how come we don't have any properties there. Now, Jonathan Png is our resident Hawaiian. And the joke has continued, but it really was the function of the bright opportunity presenting itself at the right time with a partner that we liked, we underwrote their business, we underwrote their performance, we underwrote their locations, it was just the right time at the right place. And it just so happened that it closed in the first quarter. There wasn't any grand design to be able to come out and make the kinds of announcements that we have done. We've been very opportunistic, very lucky in some ways, and very grateful to now be able to say that we are in 50 states, but that to us was not as important as finding the right transaction. And this particular transaction that allowed us to go to Hawaii certainly checks all the boxes. So, we're very grateful for that.
Katy McConnell: Okay, great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley.
Ronald Kamdem: Hey, good afternoon, just two quick ones for me. The first is just on tenant's health in general on the portfolio. Maybe if you could provide some updated thoughts on how you're feeling today, maybe versus six and 12 months ago? And then digging in a little bit deeper into some of the theaters and looking at the collection rates there, maybe some insights as the collection rate may have been a little bit lower than what we would have expected. Maybe what's going on there with theaters?
Sumit Roy: Sure, Ronald, thank you for your question. Look, our watch list is right around 5%. And it's the biggest contributor to that watch list is the theater business. So, they are very much tied. And our collection is also largely a function of the collection in the theater business. We feel you asked me to give you a reference point as to how we feel about a theatre business today versus when we first got into the pandemic, we feel a lot better today than we did then. There have been actual examples here in the U.S., which were preceded by examples playing out in China and in Japan, which lend credence to the hypothesis that we had, that the theater business once the contents was starting to get released and the social distancing norms were relaxed, the theater business was going to be able to bounce back. That piece has largely proven out to be the case, Ronald. I mean, if you look at the only one example that we currently have of a big blockbuster movie that came out, which was the Godzilla versus Kong. In the first five days, it generated right around $49 million. We've been tracking how it has done subsequent to that as well. And it's right in that high 80 right around $90 million is the collection here in the U.S. theaters. If you look at it globally, it's close to $390 million. And the budget to make that movie was right around $180 million $190 million. So, $200 million roughly largely being gathered through the theater release. And that just continues to lay credence to that as content starts to come in, as these theaters are allowed to open, AMC is largely open here in the U.S. Regal is still not. Regal is still targeting mid to late May, to open up all of its theaters. And so, we do believe that this connection is going to become a function of the theaters opening. And based on the discussions that we've had with our operators, we continue to feel very optimistic that in the near term, those collection numbers will start to go up. But look, we're also blessed with a balance sheet, to lend grace to some of these operators, as long as we believe that their operating model is going to come through and it's going to be a viable business model going forward. And we genuinely believe that the theatre industry, and specifically these two operators are going to be viable operators going forward. And so, if we have the ability to lend our balance sheet, give them a little bit more grace, in terms of stabilizing their operating business model, that's what we've done. And we feel very good about that decision.
Christie Kelly: And Ronald, this is Christie. The only thing I would add to Sumit's comments is just a reminder to the team that's on the line is that, our theater portfolio is really high quality. There's over 80% of the theaters in our portfolio that are in the top two core piles of each of the operator's footprint. And as Sumit mentioned AMC is open, but it limited capacity right now and Regal Theaters will be opening towards the end of May. And to that point, we're cautiously remain cautiously optimistic. But there's one thing I want to point out that, when we take a look at the momentum, as it relates to the collection rate in theaters, it's steady and improving. So, stabilize from year end, we were about 10% collection and then throughout the quarter, we've gained some momentum to build towards 16%. And so, we'll look forward to recording more when we come to the second quarter.
Ronald Kamdem: Great, that's helpful. My second question was just going back to the VEREIT merger. This may be just a simple question but just can you help us understand how your real estate the quality of your real estate, the quality of the retail assets that you own compares to those of VEREIT that you're going to be taking in, right? How should investor think about comparing and contrasting the quality of those portfolios, specifically, the retail piece? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Yeah, Ronald we've got 3500 properties that has been constructed over the last 11 years, since they became public. Clearly there are areas of the portfolio, one of which we touched on, has turned the corner. But it wasn't something that we would have pursued in isolation six years ago when they when they chose to do that transaction. But by and large, I would say we were pleasantly surprised when we underwrote all of their assets, all of their operators at the quality of the portfolio they had, and there was an art to be making, for whatever reason, and we're grateful, because it allowed us to create a lot of value for our business, that they were trading at a massive discount to what we believe is the inherent value, especially of their retail and industrial portfolio. And so, the other point I would like to highlight is the fact that they are complementary to our focus. This is why, things like convenience stores which we are big fans of with certain operators I want to qualify allows us to go from 12% to 9% proforma for the combination. It allows us to take our grocery from 10% to 8%, because they don't have those allocations in their portfolio. And so that certainly helps us create additional capacity plus on the theater business, they didn't have much of an exposure. So that allows us to bring down our theater exposure from 5.7% 5.6% to 3.8%, which is starting to get closer to the optimal adaptation that we have been talking about over the last couple of quarters. So, pleasantly surprised on the upside, which is one of the main reasons why we decided to move forward. And we're so grateful that we found a like-minded person and Glenn and his management team to move forward with a transaction that we genuinely believe is a win-win for both parties. So, yeah, super happy to absorb that retail and industrial portfolio into the proforma Realty Income business.
Ronald Kamdem: Super helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good afternoon out there.
Sumit Roy: Hi Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste: Can you talk about the - hello? Can you guys talk about the acquisition capital a bit more in the first quarter the low 5% of all 4.9% in UK? I believe last quarter, you suggested that cap rates would be - for this year would get back, would be similar to 2020 levels, they are closer to maybe 6% depending on mix? I understand you're seeing increased competition. We've heard of financial buyers getting 85% 90% LTV financing ABS market. So maybe, can you talk about the market and what roll that competition out from potential buyers? Is this playing on the pricing for the assets that you're looking at? And is it specific to any sub sector industry and if this low 5% cap rate is what we should expect in 2021?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. So, Haendel quarter-over-quarter these numbers are going to vary and it is largely a function of the mix. If you're going to be heavily industrial focus, the cap rates are going to be on the lower end. If you're going to be more retail focus, it will be on the higher end. I'm making general comments. Obviously, there are exceptions to even to what I just said. But if you look at what drove the UK cap rate, it was largely two industrial transactions that we did with the same seller that we have a very good relationship with. One was an industrial asset in the Greater London area, highly sought clearly a last mile location and we got it at a cap rate we felt very comfortable owning this particular asset. Another one was in the suburbs of Birmingham; you know that it's leased to a single a credit. Again, fantastic distribution center below market rents. Something that we feel like is going to be super additive to our portfolio going forward. And that's what really drove the cap rate to where it was. Had we excluded those two, our cap rate would have been closer to where we did our fourth quarter UK transactions, which was, I believe, if I remember correctly, 5.6 5.7 cap rate. So, it really is going to be a function of mix, it's going to be a function of which geography dominates, et cetera, et cetera. But I don't think you should expect the cap rate we posted in the first quarter to be the new norm. I would still say that we should average right in that mid 5s to do slightly above that, that would be the goal. And in quarters where we do some more higher yielding stocks, because it's things that we found that the people are not focused on yet, we could see a potential 6. But it really is going to be a function of a mix, it's going to be a function of asset type, lease term, geography, all of those things that go into defining what a quarter cap rate signifies. But I think the bigger point here is, this is the second quarter in a row where we've done a billion dollars. And I've seen a lot of numbers coming out talking about Oh, in order for them to get to the high single digit growth rate, they're going to have to do $4 billion of acquisition. We welcome that challenge. In fact, we are excited about that challenge. And we've already talked about what creating these new verticals for us, new markets growth for us has done to our sourcing numbers, which is not translating into actual [ph] clothes. So, for us, the numbers being posted, yes, for most net lease businesses that's a staggering number. But for us, it's something that we welcome, and we also agree with the market that it is for us to show to you that we are capable of doing this on a quarter after quarter after quarter basis. So that's where the fun part is for us and the team. We look forward to that challenge. And we look forward to posting numbers with assets that doesn't compromise what we have said is our risk profile. And that's the key message here, that we are doing all of this. And we are growing our platform and we are growing our portfolio with the right type of industries, right operators, right geographies, right growth rates, all of the things that we create sustained value over the long term. So, I know you didn't quite ask that. But I just wanted to make sure that we output the answer on cap rates in context to what it is that we are trying to do. And the sustainability of what it is that we're trying to do. So, forgive me for that Haendel.
Haendel St. Juste: No. That's perfect. Thank you for the color, I certainly appreciate it. Can you also talk a bit perhaps, are you a bit more willing today at all to consider industries that you perhaps put off to the side over the past year in the aftermath of COVID? Perhaps, expanding your investment playbook here, be automotive more entertainment or experiential things that have been a bit less COVID resilient, but given the improving vaccine distribution as the economic expansion, just curious if that view is changing at all, and if there's any specific industries reflect to?
Sumit Roy: Haendel, one of the things that will distinguish this team, I think, and I believe in, is the fact that we will always remain humble. If data is changing on the ground, if trends are changing, we're constantly trying to mark the market. But what we don't want to do is over index to any near-term phenomenon, just like we didn't over index to the fact that, hey, the theater business and the health and fitness business really took a took a beating in an environment where you have social distancing requirements. And does that mean we should go down to zero in both those businesses? The answer is no. And so, what we are trying to figure out is, what are the trends, especially given the long-term nature of the leases that we enter into, what is the trend long term that we are going to underwrite to? And just because something creates a potential opportunity near term, if we can't get comfortable with the long-term prospects, we will largely stay away from those types of situations. Now that doesn't mean we don't get a few things wrong. And in hindsight, we don't go back saying, Oh, we should have made that a different way, because our conclusion was inaccurate. But we, I believe, have gotten more things right than wrong. And that has served us well. So, the answer to your question is, without getting into specifics that we are constantly trying to upgrade our pieces to reflect what's on the ground. But we don't try to over index to it without taking into consideration with the long-term impacts of those immediate trends that we're seeing. I'll throw something out there, which is the exact opposite of what you're suggesting. I think there is an opportunity in the office sector. Now, are we going to go into the office sector? No, there's a reason why we said we are going to be spinning off all of our office assets. But I do believe that given the environment today, and given how negative the sentiment is around the office asset type, there is value to be had. If somebody is willing to take a longer-term perspective on what is office going to look like. And that's the reason why we want to create a spin off if that is the route, we end up eventually evacuating. We want to set it up for success. And it is a play on what we have seen near term. And then it's forecasting out that trendline to see what do you think it's going to happen to Office five, seven, 10 years from now? Where do we see growth? Yes, growth? I use that word with Office. Where do we see opportunities? And, there is an argument to be made that that could play out so Time will tell.
Haendel St. Juste: Any perspective you want to share on the casinos? I know it's been asked in the past. But I'm curious is that view and that subsector is any different or any more willingness today to act on that?
Sumit Roy: Yeah, I'm not going to talk about specifics Haendel. And you've always asked me very specific questions, and I've tried to stay away from it. You asked me about M&A. And I did M&A for you now. No, no, stay away from specifics Haendel. Thank you though.
Haendel St. Juste: Appreciate the time.
Operator: Your next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.
Caitlin Burrows: Hi, guys, hi there. Sumit, you gave some details to explain the relatively lower cap rate in the UK this quarter. But there's also the associated tax burden in the UK which impacted numbers in the quarter. So, I was just wondering, kind of big picture if you could go through why the UK investment activity makes sense to you bigger picture and then also how we should think about the associated tax expense going forward?
Sumit Roy: Yes, very good questions, Caitlin. Thank you. I should have actually completed my answer on the UK, giving a little bit more color on the structuring side of the equation. So, we went into the UK recognizing that there's going to be an associated track tax leakage. And when we underwrite transactions, we take into account what is our effective tax rate? What is the statutory tax rate? What's the effective tax rate? How much are we really making in terms of actual spreads, et cetera, et cetera. And of course, comparing it to the cost of capital, which is also much lower in the UK. And seeing if it's if it made sense. It made a lot of sense. And by and large, I think we are tracking to the effective tax rates that we had shared with the market two years ago in April of 2019. What I would like to add Caitlin is, there is a change that is being contemplated, that would actually increase the statutory tax rate in the UK market. But what we have been exploring and hopefully we'll be able to implement in the near term is restructuring our Realty Income limited the legal entity that that is house there where we will actually end up potentially saving 400 basis points off of our effective tax rate. So, do you expect to see this this the taxes being paid in the UK continuing to go up? Absolutely, you should. But not at the same rate as you have seen over the last three years. We are getting more efficient. We are structuring our transactions going forward in a manner where we are actually going to see on an effective basis and decrease in the tax leakage associated with our investments. And we are constantly looking at how we're going to be financing this transaction, and does it still make sense? And the answer is a resounding yes, it does. And that's the reason why we're continuing to do what we're doing.
Caitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. And then maybe switching topics, the guidance that you guys have put out assumes that same store revenue improves as the year goes on. There was commentary earlier on hopefully improving theater collections and performance and acquisitions are expected to continue. But the AFFO guidance kind of barely implies any growth from the 1Q run rate. So, I was just wondering, why is that? How does the improving same store revenues and acquisitions not translate into more meaningful AFFO for the guidance or is the AFFO guidance just pretty conservative at this point?
Sumit Roy: That's an opinion. I'll let you conclude that for yourself, but I do think Christie mentioned as to the 37 assets that are on cash accounting, so, so much of the improvement that could play out in the future has not been sort of reflected in the guidance that we have shown, but nor have we changed our cash accounting on those 37 assets. So, we really, if you want to use the word conservative, fine, we just really want to see actual collections go back up to levels that warrant a change in our thesis around cash accounting versus not. And then that would certainly translate to higher AFFO per share trend lines. But we tend to be a little bit more deliberate. And, yes, things are looking very optimistic. But until it's not actually starting to reflect in enclosed monthly statements, we're going to stay the course. And, obviously, what we have and the reason why we haven't adjusted is for the merger is because first and foremost, there are conditions involved. And even if this were to close, it won't happen to the fourth quarter, which clearly will have a very minimal impact this year. And so, for those reasons, we have kept the guidance, exactly the same. We want to digest what we just announced last week. We also want to get another quarter under our belt, and then we revisit earnings at the end of the second quarter. And share with you what our latest thoughts are on that.
Caitlin Burrows: Okay, thank you.
Christie Kelly: Thanks, Caitlin.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Janney.
Rob Stevenson: Good afternoon. You guys currently have as of March 31, 131 vacant assets and presumably you'll have additional assets become vacant over the remainder of the year. Ordinarily, some percentage of that you guys keep and release and some you sell and move on. Given the size of the very transaction of the integration process, how do you guys think about your team's bandwidth and maybe just selling a greater percentage of the vacant assets that they can't be released easily and moving on, and focusing on the integration versus the time energy and even the potential upside from re-leasing vacancy?
Sumit Roy: We are very comfortable executing exactly the same business model that we have. We have always said that, if you want to run a business 100% occupancy we can. But that is not value optimizing solution. And the reason why we have also shared with the market, our real estate operations team as is the largest in the company is to be able to do the things that we want to do. That is the reason why we have always said that 98% is the right occupancy level for us because we are going to be repositioning assets where we can create, and these numbers get buried, but 140% 170% recapture rates on rent just because of these repositioning that we are able to do but yes, it takes time and yes, that means more, you're sitting on more non-occupied assets. But we are very comfortable doing that, if that is the right economic solution to do so. And just to put things in perspective, that 131 was 140 at the end of the fourth quarter, because we got 65 of our NPC assets back. And the team was able to not only absorb the first quarter explorations, but make a dent and a pretty good one on those assets that were handed back in the NPC transaction. I am super comfortable with the team that we have and the asset management team that is led by TJ, they are a phenomenal group. And what we would like to be able to do is when we absorb VEREIT, is to be able to implement the same business model, which is a reason why we think we want to hold on to a lot of their folks and potentially share our business model with them, and tried to generate the same types of results that we've been able to generate on a standalone basis. That is another area that we can enhance through this combination.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then second question, how are you thinking about [Indiscernible] going forward? It's been mostly non-retail as of late. And even overall, it's a pretty small piece of O today about to get much smaller with the acquisition? Do you need to keep that to fulfill obligations to the customers? Does that go away? How should we be thinking? Does that - Is there a chance that that gets bigger going forward for you guys?
Sumit Roy: Rob, I missed the key word, because there was a big beep. What is it that you said that we need to keep forward? And it's a very small part of our business?
Rob Stevenson: The development business.
Sumit Roy: It's that. Yeah.
Rob Stevenson: It's mostly non-retail, and it's really even overall, a really small piece of O today, going to get much smaller. Do you grow that? Does that need to stay because of commitments to customers et cetera? How are you thinking about that business?
Sumit Roy: Very good question. We hope to grow that business. It's about a $200 million business today. And you're absolutely right, that's not very large compared to the balance sheet that we have. But, some of the repositioning's I alluded to, some of the relationships that we have with existing industrial clients who want expansion capabilities, some of the relationships that we are developing with developers to provide a capital source, that could be a takeout, all of that is incredibly valuable to us. And I would love to see with a bigger platform, make this 3X 4X or what it is today, and being another contributor of value to our business. And so, we have a team that we have continued to grow, and through this combination, we will potentially grow this team even more, so that we can continue to enhance value going forward, even while just working on our own existing assets. And going back to your previous question working on vacant assets or soon to be vacant assets, and doing repositioning. That requires an enhanced expertise in the development front. So, we will certainly hold on to it and grow it. And potentially grow the allocation from where it is today.
Rob Stevenson: Okay, thanks, guys. Appreciate it.
Christie Kelly: Thanks Rob.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brent Dilts from UBS.
Brent Dilts: Hey guys. Just Sumit, following up on your –
Christie Kelly: Hi Brent.
Brent Dilts: Hey, Christine, how are you?
Christie Kelly: Good. How are you, Brent?
Brent Dilts: Doing great. Sumit, just following up on your comment earlier about the $4 billion in acquisitions. This year that you've seen some analysts write about I'm just curious, are you seeing anything in the market that could call the slowdown in the pace of your transaction activity in the near term? Just seems like you're on pace to well exceed the minimum 3.25 you guys got to do. So, I'm just curious what you're seeing there?
Sumit Roy: Brent we are very optimistic. We, to be very honest with you, we are not seeing anything, we are obviously following some of the same rules coming out of DC and how it is going to have an impact et cetera. We are not seeing any of that translate into the volume being sourced. And our belief in not only meeting but potentially exceeding what we have shared with the market as our acquisition target. We started the year. And I think, Brent, if you recall, when we came into January, we shared with you what our pipeline looks like and how optimistic we were, that optimism has just continued to grow. So, we are super excited about not just the sheer volume but the quality that we are seeing and the quality that we are being able to get over the finish line. So, the platform is working.
Brent Dilts: Okay, perfect. And then just digging into the transaction activity a little bit more. Could you talk about what you're seeing for some of the trouble tenant asset classes as reopening plays out and rent collection rates there improve. Are you seeing any of those assets starting to trade health and fitness, movie theaters, et cetera?
Sumit Roy: Sure. We've certainly seen a couple of trades on the health and fitness side, especially with the more established operators. We've seen a few vacant assets on the theater side sell. So yes, people are getting much more optimistic about the future and are willing to buy vacant pieces of land with a building and reposition it. And that optimism is starting to filter in into the acquisition arena. But that's not an area that we play in. But it's certainly it's certainly something that's seen.
Brent Dilts: Okay. Thank you. Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from Wes Golladay from Baird.
Wes Golladay: Hi, everyone. Sort of a few quick questions for you. Hi there, Christie. Looking at the industrial same store revenue, looks like it's been negative 40 basis points last year, and it continued into this year. Do you expect that to reflect later this year?
Sumit Roy: Yeah, Wes, it's largely driven by this one asset that we had incorrectly calculated the CPI adjustment to it. And when we realized our mistake, and of course, we had collected rent on that. We went back to our clients and we shared with them that look, there was a mistake. And we gave them all - we readjusted the rent going forward. And that's really what you're starting to see play out. And so, obviously the client was incredibly happy about us coming out and sharing this information. But that's really what you're seeing play out. If you look at the actual leases on the industrial front, they have a lot more growth built into it than even our retail leases doing. So, the same store rent numbers should actually on a normalized basis, whereas I would expect it to go up. Not down.
Wes Golladay: Gotcha. And then, made this early but I was curious about the potential office spin off how the capital structure would look and what that would mean for O's proforma leverage?
Sumit Roy: We are absolutely focused on maintaining our A three A minus rating. And I believe the rating agencies came out and re-established, the ratings as well as the outlook post the announcement, we made last week and we are very much focused that proforma for the spend, we will continue to maintain ratings because even proforma for the spend, the proforma company is going to be close to $50 billion in size. And we'll have leverage metrics that is equivalent, if not better than what where we are today. So, it is super important for us to maintain our ratings.
Wes Golladay: Got it. Thank you. Well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jeffries.
Christie Kelly: Hi Linda.
Linda Tsai: Hello, Christie. Hi, Sumit. Maybe following up on your earlier comment that you can handle and welcome large acquisition volumes. For this quarter you sourced $20 billion and invested in 5%. Does this 5% or $1 billion executed to $20 billion sourced ratio remain consistent post-merger?
Sumit Roy: I hope it gets enhanced. I think I said this last week, and does that where VEREIT has been spending a fair amount of their time is not exactly 100% of an overlap of where we spend our time. So, we would like to be able to continue to leverage their platform and their ability to play in a zip code that we haven't spent a lot of time because, we're finding plenty of opportunities in the areas that we would really want to focus on. So, my hope is that pro forma for the combination, that the platform will increase in size and the area of focus will increase. And therefore, we might be able to create a trend line that is a step up from where we are today. But that is down the road. I want to stay focus on where we are today and the platform that we have currently. And if you look at the ratio of what gets closed versus what gets source, we have generally been in this 4% to 7%to 8% zip code for many quarters now. I mean, have there been quarters where those numbers may have been higher or slightly lower, perhaps, but it's generally in the zip code and we have the infrastructure to absolutely deal with that volume, and deal with getting our share of that volume over the finish line. And we haven't remained stagnant. That's the other point. I know, that's not very obvious from the outside, our team has grown. We have a complete platform now in the UK, which is in addition to the platform that we have in the U.S., which didn't exist. So, the platform has continued to grow, to absorb this higher volume of analysis that that is being asked of this team. So, so far, so good.
Linda Tsai: Thanks. And then my second question is with G&A at about 4.5%. Do you have a sense of how low this could go maybe a few years out post-merger?
Sumit Roy: We talked about the G&A synergies in that $45 million to $50 million, and a cash synergy is in 35 to 40. I think there's some analysis that the team has done, where we show you that the journey to gross asset value potentially drops by one-third, going from 33 basis points to 23 basis points or 22 basis points. And, that is the goal. We absolutely believe in that, that the larger our platform becomes, the more scalable it is, and therefore it should translate to G&A numbers continuing to go down. But how far down does it go? I can't tell you. It's also going to be a function of, do we continue to add new swim lanes? If we do, we need the infrastructure to help support that. And if it keeps our G&A elevated, because we're still not reaching this normalized level of what this business and platform is capable of doing, I'm totally fine having a G&A in the course. But on a normalized level. If we have exhausted all possible swim lanes, then who knows that this thing can go? I don't have a precise answer for your Linda.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Massocca from Ladenburg Thalmann.
Christie Kelly: Hey, John.
John Massocca: Good afternoon. How's it going?
Sumit Roy: Good. How are you?
John Massocca: Just a quick one from me, outside of office, how much roughly speaking of the VEREIT portfolio do you view as being a target for capital recycling as you look to manage the portfolio?
Sumit Roy: I think I've answered this question in a different way, in terms of how much did we like the industrial and the retail portfolio that will be part of remain comp [ph] going forward? We don't see their makeup being largely different from ours, except in the areas that they've chosen to focus on. But the more we underwrote those industries and the actual operators that they have exposure to, the more comfortable we got that overall, this portfolio is one that we will be very proud to absorb. So, John, I don't have a precise answer. Could you see a corresponding increase in our capital recycling that we managed through disposition? You could, but that would be more of a function of the size of the platform has just increased rather than it getting disproportionately larger, because there's a lot more assets on their side that we would want to recycle that. Time will tell, but I suspect that it will be commensurate with what we are established as a standalone company today.
John Massocca: Okay. All my other questions have been answered. So that's it for me. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America.
Christie Kelly: Hey, Josh.
Joshua Dennerlein: Hey Christie, hope you're doing well. Curious how you think about Europe now that you're a larger entity, just split the $2 billion mark over in UK. Are you thinking of kind of accelerating one of the portions to the rest of Europe at this time, or there are some other hurdles that you do look into [Indiscernible]?
Sumit Roy: You know, Josh, that's a very good question. And I do want to answer it. What we were planning on doing on a standalone basis has absolutely not changed because of the announcement we made last week. I don't believe that it accelerates our desire to go into the rest of Europe, just because of this particular merger. Our desire to go to other geographies and other markets are largely being driven by our underwriting, our ability to absorb new markets, the team that we have in place, the maturity of our understanding of these various different markets. That's what's driving our desires. And so, yes, could we do more because the scale benefits of absorbing $15 billion platform? The answer is absolutely, yes. We can do more. And so, I think that's where the benefit comes. But I don't think, trying new things is triggered by the fact that we have a large platform off of which to try it. So, I just wanted to make that nuanced point, Josh. But it was a great question. And I'm glad you asked.
Joshua Dennerlein: Great, I appreciate it. That's it from me.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Josh.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Harsh Hemnani from Green Street.
Christie Kelly: Hi Harsh.
Harsh Hemnani: Hi. Hey Sumit, you mentioned that you're looking to grow the development side of the business, as far as looking at the initial use on those this quarter, they were roughly equal the yields on acquisition. I'm just trying to understand the spread over your cost of capital that you see on the acquisition side versus what you're aiming towards on the development side long term.
Sumit Roy: Yeah, Harsh, very good question. But again, it's a function of the mix, where the development dollars are going. If it is going towards industrial assets, which you will see that it is, the vast majority of the capital is going towards takeouts. And those cap rates, if they have a 5 in front of them, that's a great outcome. Because guess what happens once these assets are fully developed, and you go out into the open market, and you try to buy it from the open market, it potentially has a low 4s, even a 3 handled in front it. And that is the reason why we feel like yes, these cap rates, headline cap rates may look low. But if you really dive in behind the numbers, and you try to figure out what is the product that they're being able to get through this development funding, takeout funding, whatever you want to call it versus what could they buy the same particular asset, if it were available today, there is still 100 basis points, maybe 50 basis points, if you want to be conservative optimist, that we are getting by partnering with some of these very well-established global developers. So that's really where the value creation is. To answer your question more specifically what do I see the yield on development. If you look at retail, when you look at retail development, it depends on whether it's a repositioning or a Greenfield or what hasn't. On repositioning, that's where the maximum value creation occurs, we already have the piece of land, we go down the path of creating or repositioning an asset with the expectation that, you know, an AI through some of these numbers out at you that we could have ran compared to the privy positioning of 150, 200 even 300 - or 300 percentages of points. So that's the kind of uplift in value we could generate through this. Now that is a small portion of our business, a very small portion. But I just want to put in perspective that you see a blended number, but if you go behind the number there is a fair amount of value creation. And largely we want to be viewed as a one stop shop by our tenants who know us as landlords that hold assets for the long term. And if we can help them, harness our vacant asset portfolio by repositioning it for their needs. We want to be there to serve them. And that's the reason for having this. But in terms of how big is it going to become? What is the trend line going to look like? It's going to be a function of what dominates in that one given quarter.
Harsh Hemnani: That's interesting. And then one more for me, on the debt synergies from the very first deal. Given that you have a lower cost of capital in the UK, could we expect to see a higher leverage ratio on your UK assets than in the U.S.?
Sumit Roy: No, again, it goes back to our ratings Harsh. If you want a guiding principle, look at our balance sheet on a fully consolidated basis. And we want to be right down the fairway which keeps our rating agencies very happy. Yeah, that allows us the maximum flexibility to run our business. But we do not want to do anything that's going to compromise our A minus A 3 rating. Now, the mix of where that comes from, could absolutely change. A lot more of it could come from the UK, given the ARB between a tenuous Sterling denominated unsecured bond versus a U.S. unsecured bond. And we may choose again just to match fund our assets with locally denominated capital, we may choose to over lever some of those assets. But there is a threshold beyond which we are not going to go, even on a standalone basis. But yes, we can certainly have more of a mix coming from the UK given the lower cost there than the U.S. And then if you look at it on a fully consolidated basis, it's going to have the same profile that you would expect of an A 3 A minus rated company. I hope that answers your question.
Harsh Hemnani: That's helpful. Thank you.
Christie Kelly: Thanks, Harsh.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.
Sumit Roy: Well, thank you all for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with each of you soon. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-23 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Cree, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Realty Income Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2020 Operating Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Crum, Associate Director at Reality income. You may begin, sir.
Andrew Crum: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter and year-end 2020 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.  During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in these forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-K. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. As we remain in a remote work environment to promote the safety of our employees and community, I continue to be impressed by the resiliency and talent of our team to drive our business forward through the current pandemic. Additionally, I remain appreciative of the support resiliency of our clients and partners who continue to perform under challenging circumstances.  On the personal front, we were excited to welcome Christie Kelly to our management team in January as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and in February, Michele Bechor joined our team as Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel and Secretary.  Mike Pfeiffer, who served as Executive Vice President, Chief Officer, General Counsel and Secretary, will retire after over 30 years of service. Mike will remain serving our company through June 2021 as Chief Administrative Officer and will continue leading our team members as well as assisting Christie and Michelle through their transition at Realty Income until his well-deserved retirement.  Words cannot fully reflect Mike's many contributions to our company for over 3 decades, and I'm so immensely grateful for his partnership with me throughout the year.  Moving on to financial matters, including a summary of the quarter and year. During the fourth quarter, we invested over $1 billion in high-quality real estate, including $467 million in the U.K., bringing us to over $2.3 billion invested during 2020, approximately $921 million of which was invested in the U.K. Investments during the year were largely concentrated in the grocery and home improvement industries, both of which continue to thrive during the current economic environment.  We maintained low leverage and ample liquidity throughout the year while enhancing our financial flexibility. Highlights include the establishment of a $1 billion commercial paper program, our successful debut public issuance of sterling denominated unsecured notes and record low coupon rates for 5 years and 12-year dollar-denominated bonds in the REIT sector. We have also been active in the equity capital markets to accretively fund our acquisition pipeline. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we raised approximately $605 million of equity, primarily through our ATM program. And in January, we raised an additional $670 million of equity through an overnight offering.  Accordingly, our balance sheet is well positioned to address what continues to be an active investment pipeline. To that end, we are introducing 2021 acquisitions guidance of over $3.25 billion, as we are well positioned to continue the momentum we experienced at the close of last year and in January. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $1 billion in 70 properties located in 22 states and the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.4% with a weighted average lease term of 13.4 years.  On a total revenue basis, approximately 68% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment-grade rated tenants. 71% of the revenue is generated from retail tenants. These assets are leased to 31 different tenants in 19 industries. Of the $1 billion invested during the quarter, $541 million was invested domestically in 59 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.1 years.  During the quarter, $467 million was invested internationally in 11 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.7% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.7 years. During 2020, we invested over $2.3 billion in 244 properties located in 30 states in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.9% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.2 years.  On a revenue basis, 61% of 2020 acquisitions are from investment-grade rated tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial assets. These assets are leased to 56 different tenants in 26 industries, 2 of the most significant industries represented our grocery and home improvement. Of the $2.3 billion invested during 2020, nearly $1.4 billion was invested domestically in 220 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. And approximately $921 million was invested internationally in 24 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 10.8 years.  Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $17.1 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we sourced approximately $63.6 billion in potential transaction opportunities. The most we have ever reviewed in a given year. Of these opportunities, $42.4 billion were domestic opportunities and $21.2 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 50% of the volumes sourced during the year. Of the $63.6 billion sourced, 56% were portfolios and 44%, approximately, $28.2 billion were one-off assets.  Of the $1 billion in total acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 66% were one-off transactions. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 130 basis points.  Moving to dispositions. During the quarter, we sold 60 properties for net proceeds of $77.5 million, realizing an unlevered IRR of 8.7%. This brings us to 125 properties sold during 2020 for $261 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8%, and we realized an unlevered IRR of 11.6%. Our portfolio remains well diversified by clients, industry, geography and property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At year-end, our properties were leased to approximately 600 clients in 51 separate industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the U.K.  Approximately 84% of rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at approximately 11% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.7% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 11.9% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to that business. We continue to believe these characteristics allow our tenants to operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete more effectively with e-commerce.  These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We remain constructive on the credit quality of the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 97.9% at year-end. During the fourth quarter, we released 77 properties, recapturing 100.3% of the expiring rents.  During 2020, we re-leased 314 properties, recapturing 100% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,500 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. In light of COVID-19, rent collection across our portfolio has remained stable over recent months. During the fourth quarter, we collected 93.6% of contractual rent due and further improvement in rent collection percentages is primarily dependent upon improvements in the theater industry, which I will touch on shortly.  We collected 100% of contractual rent for the fourth quarter from investment-grade rated tenants, which further validates the importance of our high-quality real estate portfolio, least to large, well-capitalized clients. While we have not historically prioritized investment-grade rated tenants as a primary objective. During periods of economic uncertainty, high-grade credit tenants tend to provide more reliable streams of income as the last several quarters have exemplified.  Our Top 4 industries, convenience stores, grocery stores, drug stores and dollar stores, each sell essential goods and represent over 37% of rental revenue, and we have received nearly all of the contractual rent due to us from tenants in these industries since the pandemic began. Uncollected rent continues to be primarily in the theater industry, representing approximately 80% of uncollected rent in December.  As the theater industry remains challenged, I would like to update the investment community on our latest view. The industry represents 5.6% of our contractual base. While we do expect the industry to downsize in the future, we continue to believe it will remain a viable industry in a post pandemic environment, especially for high budget blockbuster movies.  You might recall that the U.S. box office reached an all-time high as recent as 2018, and 2019 produced the highest grossing worldwide film of all times in Avengers: Endgame. We continue to believe, particularly for blockbuster movies that a theatrical release will be the preferred distribution channel for studios going forward, given the superior economics supported to them versus streaming platforms.  That said, we do acknowledge that the industry is changing and that there likely will be a rationalization of theaters in a post pandemic reality. Under this scenario, underperforming theaters may not survive. We continue to maintain a full reserve, the outstanding receivable balance for 37 of our 77 total theater assets and continue to recognize revenue on a cash basis for these 37 assets.  During the fourth quarter, we established a full reserve for 1 additional theater asset, and we disposed off one theater asset previously on cash accounting. To be clear, we do not expect to lose the entirety of rent associated with these properties longer term, even in the event of potential closures. As of year-end, the total allowance for these 37 theaters totaled $23.7 million, including $1.8 million of which is a straight-line rent receivable reserve and thus has no AFFO impact.  Moving on. Our same-store rental revenue decreased 3.2% during the quarter and 1.7% year-to-date. Our reported same-store growth includes deferred rent and unpaid rent that we have deemed to be collectible over the existing lease term, but it excludes rent where collectibility is deemed less than probable. The decrease in same-store rental revenue is primarily driven by reserves we recognized in the theater industry and to a lesser extent, the health and fitness industry.  Now to provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter, I would like to hand it off to Christie.
Christie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit, and I'm honored to have joined Realty Income as CFO.. Having joined the Board in 2019, I have experienced firsthand the talent of our Realty Income team, together with the exciting growth opportunities for our business.  I'm looking forward to working together with our teams to deliver our strategic objectives and realization of dreams and aspirations for all at Realty Income with Sumit and our Board of Directors. I also look forward to engaging with our investment community over time. We are grateful for the support of all of our loyal shareholders who have invested in Realty Income for over 26 years as a public company and for our future.  I would now like to provide a general overview of our recent financial results, starting with the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain one of only a handful of REITs with at least 2 A ratings. During the quarter, we completed our debut public offering of Sterling denominated senior unsecured totes, issuing GBP 400 million due 2030 for an effective annual yield to maturity of 1.71%.  We also issued 725 million of senior unsecured notes in December through a dual tranche offering of 5-year and 12-year notes. Achieving record low U.S. dollar coupon rates in the REIT sector for each of those tenors. Additionally, we raised approximately $655 million of equity during the quarter, primarily through our ATM program. And in January 2021, we raised approximately $670 million through an overnight equity offering, which we earmarked to prefund an active investment pipeline to start the year.  We ended the year with low leverage and strong coverage metrics with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.3x or 5.2x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remained strong at 5.1x. We ended the year with full availability under our $3 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility. No borrowings outstanding on our $1 billion commercial paper program and over $824 million of cash on hand.  In January, we completed the early redemption of all $950 million, 3.25 notes due 2022, which was done to reduce our near-term refinancing risk and take advantage of attractive borrowing rates in the fixed income market. Looking forward, our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with only $44 million of debt maturities through year-end 2021, excluding commercial paper borrowings.  Now moving on to our income statement. AFFO per share during the quarter was $0.84 and $3.39 per the year on a fully diluted basis, representing annual growth of 2.1%. For 2020, our AFFO per share was negatively impacted by non-straight-line rent reserves of $44.1 million, which represents approximately $0.13 per share of dilution, over half of which is attributed to the theater industry.  Now moving on to guidance. As we introduced our initial 2021 earnings estimate, we acknowledge that while some uncertainty related to the theater industry remains together with the backdrop of the pandemic, our confidence in providing guidance is supported by the overall health and stability of our portfolio combined with the acquisition pipeline.  To that end, our 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.44 to $3.49, represents approximately 1.5% to 3% growth over 2020. Moving on to dividends. In December, we increased the dividend for the 109th time in our company's history. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.4%. And we are proud to be 1 of only 3 REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index for having increased our dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years.  And now I'd like to hand our call back over to Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. As we reflect on 2020, we stand behind the overall resiliency of our portfolio. The relentless efforts of our team to add shareholder value and the outlook for our business over the long term. The momentum in our investment pipeline are ample sources of liquidity, and our size and scale positions us favorably to capitalize on near-term growth opportunities around the globe.  At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra: Maybe just -- congratulations on the new role. Maybe just to start off with the occupancy degradation, as you outlined it. I'm just wondering if you can talk about two things pertaining to that. One, sort of plans to backfill some of that or recapture some of that occupancy loss. And then as we think about kind of '21, what sort of embedded in terms of potential other areas where you might lose occupancy?
Sumit Roy: Those are great questions, Vikram. And thank you. So at the end of the third quarter, we were right at 98.6%. And the question was asked, where do you think you're going to end the year up? And we had said that it was going to be right around 98%. And the fact that we came at 97.9% was fairly accurate. And what we saw coming was the NPC bankruptcy filing. As you might recall, we have approximately 150 assets with NPC, most of which happens to be the Pizza Hut. And then we have 19 assets that are Wendy's that's also run by NPC.  We were expecting 66 assets to be rejected through the bankruptcy process. And that was the reason why we had guided the market to a 98 -- approximately a 98% occupancy number. We were -- and those 66 assets did come back to us during the fourth quarter, which is the largest driver of this 97.9%. You will see that the net increase in vacant assets from third quarter to fourth quarter was circa 45 assets. So despite the fact that we got 66 assets back, we were able to resolve a lot more assets than we had originally thought because these assets are very well located, Vikram, and we were able to attract either QSRs that wanted to take some of these assets. And we feel very good about being able to resolve these assets fairly quickly.  The other point I'll make is most of these Pizza Huts with NPC had less than 2 years remaining on their lease term. And so our asset management team had already begun the process of trying to figure out alternatives. Knowing fully well that these were the assets that would come back, even if it were to have not filed bankruptcy.  So we feel pretty good about being able to resolve these assets. And as you can see from the resolution, we have the most number of resolutions in the fourth quarter. This was a record quarter for us. And so it's a testament to the team that we have in place, Ben and TJ, who drive that particular process for us, continue to do an absolutely amazing job despite the backdrop of the pandemic. And we are very hopeful that we will climb right back up above 98%.  Look, we have frictional vacancy, and we've always suggested that to the group that because we want to have the ability to reposition some of these assets, we are always going to be in this 98% -- circa 98% occupancy rate because we do want to reposition some of these assets, which does take us time, and that will continue to be what we target going forward.
Vikram Malhotra: That makes sense. And then just one, Christie, for you. The overall AFFO growth, I know there's some dilution or maybe just some headwinds near term. You obviously prefunded some of this. Can you just give us a rough sense of the AFFO growth sort of in the first half year-over-year versus the second half of the year?
Christie Kelly: I think, Vikram, that in terms of where we're going to see AFFO growth, I think you can expect that to be a bit similar to historical norms outside of probably the second quarter of last year where we pulled back on acquisitions a bit. But nothing out of the ordinary.
Operator: Your next question is from Haendal St. Juste with Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: Can you talk a bit about decline in cash yields in the fourth quarter. Through the first three quarters of last year, the average cash yield were closer to 6%, decline to 5% in the fourth quarter. So you could just talk about what drove that decline. And you also mentioned that 61% of the 4Q volume was one-off transaction. So how should we think about the balance between one-offs in portfolios near term? And what type of pricing differential are you seeing there?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Good question, Haendel. As you pointed out, the lower cap rate was largely driven by the mix of assets that we purchased here in the U.S. If you look at the prepared remarks, I suggested that 29% of what we purchased here in the U.S. were industrial assets, single-tenant industrial assets. These were very well placed assets with clients that who are executing on their omnichannel strategy had lease terms that were north of 10 years, some 15-year leases, good growth in markets that we wanted to enhance our exposure and with rents that were right around market rents. And so as you know, the industrial assets tend to be trading a lot more aggressively. And as such, that certainly had a bit of a downdraft on our cap rate, but the fact that we were able to do 5.2% for the U.S. assets was largely driven by that.
Haendel St. Juste: Okay. And then maybe a bit of color on the guide for this year, $3.25 billion. I'm curious how we should think about the yields on that front. And as part of your conversation with potential sellers, I'm curious, if in light of potential 1031 repeal, would you consider issuing units to sellers and how that might be perceived or any initial sense of -- or have you discussed that with potential sellers and what feedback you might be getting on that?
Sumit Roy: Sure. Again, good questions, Haendel. Look, we came out in early January with what our pipeline looked for the first quarter. And you might recall we had about $800 million -- slightly above $800 million that we had disclosed to the market at that time that we had in our pipeline, and we were 12 days into the year. So I don't think it should have come as a surprise that we had an incredibly healthy pipeline developed coming out of the fourth quarter. And if you look at what we were able to achieve in the fourth quarter of $1 billion, we had a tremendous amount of momentum that sort of carried forward into the first quarter and that has continued. It is also a testament to the amount of sourcing that we are able to do, the new swim lanes that we have created for ourselves to continue to grow the portfolio. And I think it's a testament to the strategy that we put in place a couple of years ago to be able to now post numbers that seem very large relative to what we have come out with in years past. But that's precisely the path that we wanted to go down.  You mentioned what is the expected cap rates? I think you should expected cap rates to be similar to what we achieved in 2020. And given the mix of portfolio, the optimal portfolio allocation that we have sort of highlighted to the market, it's really going to be a function of which particular portfolio or assets closed within a quarter as to whether the cap rates are going to come out.  If it's going to have a slightly more industrial plan to it, it's going to be lower cap rates. If it's going to be more retail, it's going to have a slightly higher cap rate. Having said that, even retail, especially though those types of retail that are deemed essential, portfolios are now trading in the mid-4s. And so the pricing environment has gotten a lot more aggressive. But thankfully, we have the cost of capital, and we were still able to generate 160 basis points of spread for the entire year, which is north of our historical spread. So we feel very good about the quality of assets we are buying and how we are reshaping our portfolio along the lines of what we had shared with the market in the third quarter, et cetera.  So really, the cap rate is going to be a function of the composition of assets that we drive within a given quarter.  The last question you had talked about was 1031. And what is the impact or our ability to issue OP units. Well, it's not new for us. We have done this in the past. We've bought assets from retail shareholders who wanted to buy -- wanted to take OP units as consideration for proceeds, and we were able to satisfy that. So could I see that momentum picking up potentially to defer having to pay taxes?  Absolutely. And we are very well equipped to take advantage of that. And use our equity as currency to provide that to potential sellers.  But having said all of that, 1031 is not a big part of our business, even on the disposition side. As you can see, most of the assets that we sell tend to be vacant assets, and that doesn't lend itself to the 1031 market. It's primarily developers or tenants who want to own their own assets that tend to play in that particular area. And on the occupied side, a lot of the transactions we did in 2020 were existing tenants exercising their option to purchase. And that's the reason why we were able to generate very good proceeds and very good overall returns. And the opportunistic sales tend to be an area where perhaps we run into some 1031 buyers. But that, I would say, is about 25% of the sellers that we interact with.  So for us, I think the -- on the disposition side is going to be fairly muted. On the acquisition side, I think not having 1031 be as aggressive, especially on the smaller boxes like QSRs and drug stores, et cetera. We could see cap rates increase because of the lack of 1031 buyers. And so that could potentially accrue to our benefit, especially when we are engaging in these one-off asset acquisitions.
Haendel St. Juste: Welcome, Christie. I look forward to meeting you in person.
Christie Kelly: Thank you so much, Haendel. Me too.
Operator: You our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotia Bank.
Greg McGinniss: And Christie starting with you. First, welcome. Secondly, if you can just dig into guidance real quick. Is the acquisition guidance of at least $3.25 billion, which is an interesting way to say that you're probably confident you're going to get more than that. But how should we be thinking about what gets you to the top or bottom end of the AFFO per share guidance range, given that acquisition expectation.
Sumit Roy: I know the question was geared towards Christie and Christie, please jump in. But why don't I take that a little bit? And then I'll hand it off to Christie, if that's okay, Greg.  For us, we wanted to make sure that we came out with a range that represented the facts on the ground today. And we wanted to make sure that the range was conservative enough where even if the situation were not to improve, and it was to be, as we have experienced early on in the year in January and December of last year that this is the range that we feel very comfortable with.  What I'm suggesting is that there could be a fair amount of upside to the range that we have shared. And it's largely a function of what's going to happen to the theater industry at large, but also, to a smaller extent, to the health and fitness industry. And there, we feel very confident that the theater business is going to improve, especially with the vaccination having taken hold and every day, we see more news about Pfizer and Moderna and now potentially J&J being on the approved list, that the acceleration of getting to a point where we have herd immunity is very realistic.  And I've seen base case models that suggest that as early as end of June, we could get close to having herd immunity. The other data point that I would point to, Greg, is what we have seen in China. And over the Chinese -- the Lunar New Year, we can -- they had record ticket sales. And in fact, one of the movies that was shown had almost $50 million more in sales than the record that had been set by Avengers: Endgame here in the U.S. and in Canada, and their opening we can't. And so all of these facts sort of lead us to believe that there is a possibility that there is a fair amount of upside on the assumptions that we have shown in our model. And that could that could help get us to the top end of the range. And if a lot of other things fall into place, potentially, we could do even better.  But we can't go out with that expectation. When you lay out all the various different scenarios. You come up with what's the probability weighted outcome. And that's what we have shared with the market. But there are things that could play in our favor, and it really is a function of how you think about the theater industry and what you think the recovery is going to look like. And we've shared with you at nauseam some of the assumptions that we have drawn in terms of taking 37 of our 77 assets and viewing it on a cash accounting basis and how that percolates through the base model. If your view shifts, to say, that's perhaps a bit too conservative then there is good upside. And that's what we are super excited about.  There are certainly other levers for us to play, like you correctly pointed out, the acquisition market is something we are super excited about. And part of it is intentional and part of it is a function of more and more operators and clients that we want to do business with, wanting to engage in sale-leaseback transactions. And so that too could act as a potential tailwind. And look, we've come out with numbers. You've seen our history about the early estimates that we come out with and what we are able to achieve during the year. But not saying that -- but there too, there could be some tailwinds. So there's acquisition fronts. There are assumptions that we have made about the theater business and the health and fitness business. There are assumptions we've made about how quickly we could get to a point where things are starting to normalize, et cetera.  And all of those have room and capacity for potentially surprising on the upside. So we feel pretty good. And I'll hand it back to Christie, if there's anything else you would like to add.
Christie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. And Greg, thanks so much for the question. But I absolutely echo everything that Sumit has said. We spent, as you can imagine in the backdrop of 2020, a good bit of time really thinking about the guidance and being very thoughtful about how we went out in terms of our range of AFFO per share.  And as Sumit said, there are a number of levers that we have to the upside in terms of sale-leaseback transactions, a bit more on the acquisition side and also really looking at primarily the theater industry.  And so there is positive momentum. And in light of that, we do feel, as Sumit said, very good about where we are right now and the momentum that we have in the business.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. Great. For my second question, Sumit, inflation is increasingly top of conversation with investors. Could you perhaps provide some context on real TCPI-based lease escalator exposure, and how the company is positioned to provide growing returns relative to peers in an inflationary environment?
Sumit Roy: Sure. So I would say about 20%. It's probably a little bit bigger than that. Of our leases have CPI adjustments. And -- but a lot of these have a floor in the ceiling associated with them. So yes, a rising CPI environment, we have some level of protection, but there does tend to be -- especially here in the U.S., there tends to be a floor in the ceiling associated with it.  For us, the -- we've encountered this problem before. What happens in an inflationary environment? The fact that we have leases that are net lease in nature. We are less sort of less susceptible to an environment where inflation expectation and actual inflation goes up because so much of the cost, either insurance, property, taxes, et cetera, are paid by our tenants. And so from that perspective, we feel pretty good. We started to see the 10-year treasury go up in anticipation of expected inflation going up. But thankfully, so far, our spreads have come down as well. And our all-in cost in the tenure has gone up slightly, but not dramatically. We can still issue tenure -- in today's environment, we think right around the 2122 ZIP code.  And that is still relative to what we've been able to do in the past, a very good all-in costs on the 10-year financing. So we feel pretty good about that. Some of this is now offset by what we are seeing in the U.K. as well as in Europe, where interest rates continue to be low, inflation expectations are very much contained. And so there, our all-in cost of financing continues to be super exciting. And so the fact that we have created all of these different alternatives also helps us shield us somewhat from inflation expectations arising in particular geographies and so we feel pretty good about that as well. And the fact that we have long-term leases also is a benefit.  Look, at some point, if the inflation expectations are going up, and it is largely translating to better GDP growth, et cetera, that should translate to better fundamentals for our tenants. And so not so much this year, we only have about 1.7% of our leases expiring. But in future years, that should start to reflect on higher market rents, et cetera. And so especially in 2022, 2023, we have a bit more of a expiration with regards to our leases, I could see us marking to market some of our leases during renewal time. And so I think from all of those perspectives, we feel pretty good.  One of the questions that often comes up, okay, if the interest rate environment continues to go up, it's going to impact your cost of capital, and that is absolutely true. But what we have found in prior cycles is that cap rates tend to follow suit as well. And there is definitely a lag, but it does sort of follow and then it allows us to continue to maintain the spreads that we have. And in certain situations, even enhance our spreads if the cap rate moves faster than our cost of capital. So we feel like we are very well positioned as a company. And based on some of the investments we've made and some of the areas that we have focused on, we feel like we are very well situated to handle an interest rate environment that increases an inflationary expectation environment that increases.
Operator: Next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.
Caitlin Burrows: Welcome to the -- Christie to the earnings call. Maybe just following up on the guidance question. One of the pieces you guys showed was income taxes and that they're expected to increase in 2021. And I think that's related to U.K. activity. But could you give us some more detail on what's driving this and how we should think about it increasing in the future? And is it a function of U.K. activity?
Christie Kelly: It is, Caitlin. And I think that you can expect modest increases as we continue to expand our U.K. presence.
Caitlin Burrows: Okay. So if we look at like the year-over-year increase from 2020, I guess, should we just see that if you're making a similar amount of U.K. investment dollars that the income tax dollars may go up at, I don't know, kind of similar type rate?
Christie Kelly: Similarly, yes.
Caitlin Burrows: Okay. And then when we think about the deferrals that Realty Income put in place in 2020, I guess, could you give some detail on when you expect to receive those and to the extent that any have already been built, kind of how that collection is going. And similarly, when you'll start to know if the reserves you were taking were conservative, right? Or sort of the opposite of conservative would be aggressive.
Christie Kelly: Sounds good, Caitlin. I think, first of all, what I can say is that as it relates to the deferrals that we've been taking. Essentially, when we look at the overall deferrals, we're really looking at a short-term payback and within 18 months. And as it relates to collections and the like, we are experiencing collections even before the deferrals are coming due. So we've been having some positive traction on that. All that being said, we've got 2021 in front of us.
Caitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. So when we think about what's built into guidance and the reserves that you guys took last year, obviously, you gave the guidance range. You gave thinking that it would be accurate, but is it right to think that as we go through 2021, we'll start to maybe even early in the year, get some clarity on whether or not the reserves you took in 2020 were the right amount?
Christie Kelly: Yes, yes. And we go through, Caitlin, you may already know this, but a very rigorous review on our receivables positioning and it's cross functional. It involves finance, it involves legal, our asset management group and research. And so in terms of the actions that we've taken, we feel very solid about the reserve position. And as we look forward, our collections have been consistent and steady. Where we are right now in the fourth quarter, we've got close to 94% of collections. And really, when you take a look at the uncollected rent in our company, it's really a story about theaters. 80% of the uncollected rent is focused on the theater business, which is 5.6%, as you know, of our contractual rent base. And the remaining of the story is really around health and fitness, which is primarily the remaining 16% of uncollected rent. And we did incur some collections on the health and fitness business. As Sumit said and we've talked about, we still have theaters in front of us. But there've been really positive momentum, and we view that potentially could be an upside for our business going forward.
Operator: Your next question is from Rob Stevenson with Janney.
Robert Stevenson: Just a question on the -- your comments on the movie theater business. Given that, would you be an incremental buyer of movie theaters in any type of scale going forward here?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So Rob, I think this question was asked last quarter as well. Look, we like to reach other business. But 1 of the lessons learned through this process is that should this represent at least when the pandemic started 6% of our overall portfolio. And I think what we have concluded through this process is that this business should survive but there will be some level of real estate rationalization. And we are very happy to have put together this portfolio largely through sale leasebacks with the operators themselves. And so feel very good about our current portfolio. But the idea long-term is to continue to dwindle our exposure to this particular industry to something that is closer to a 3% ZIP code. So I think that answers your question, Rob. We feel like, over time, we need to get it down to about 3% of our overall portfolio.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. Helpful. And then how are you thinking about non-U.K. European acquisitions at this point and given what's going on over there?
Sumit Roy: Non-European U.K. acquisition. So how am I thinking about the U.K. acquisition?
Robert Stevenson: Non-U.K., European. So the continent. So Germany, Scandinavia, outside of the U.K., are you guys -- should we expect that you guys -- you see the U.K. as a launching point to make bigger acquisitions and expand throughout Europe? Is it only going to wind up being U.K. at this point for the near term? How are you thinking about that in the context of the last 12 to 18 months in your experience there? Will we be expecting to see another line in the acquisitions at some point in 2021 or early 2022 in addition to the U.S. and the U.K., continental Europe acquisitions.
Sumit Roy: We've always said that U.K. was our first step into a European strategy, a western European strategy, and that continues to be the path that we are embarking upon, Rob.  We are very well-established in the U.K., some of the numbers that we have posted, I believe, is a testament to that statement. We -- I'm delighted to also share with you that we've hired another full-time person at Negara in our U.K. office. Who has a lot of experience doing acquisitions and has a lot of relationships, et cetera, in the Western Europe -- European markets. And so the goal is to continue to look for transactions and not be constrained by geography, but look for the right transactions. And there are markets that we have identified in Western Europe that we would like to be able to grow into. But it's largely a function of do we have the right operators willing to transact at the right prices, et cetera, et cetera. So are we open to acquiring in Western Europe? The answer is categorical yes. But do I expect to see something happen in Spain? I don't have a timeline for that or something in France or Italy or Germany, I don't have a timeline for you. It's largely going to be a function, what's available and who we can get to work with and whether they fit into our overall target client list.
Robert Stevenson: And the financing options in the continent over there, are they as attractive to you at this point as the U.K. if you were to buy something, would you finance it in local currency?
Sumit Roy: Absolutely. I mean, that's been our goal is try to minimize our exchange rate risk as much as we can, and we would follow a similar pattern to what we did in the U.K. where we did our debut, Sterling offering and prior to that, we had done a private placement, raising capital in U.K. denominated pounds. And that will continue to be how we finance our transactions. And that's where it becomes super exciting, Rob. I mean, you can do a 10-year paper in euro-denominated debt at 65, 70 basis points. Yes, cap rates are a lot more aggressive. But when you sort of factor in the cost of financing for somebody who's A-, A3 rated, it suddenly starts to make a lot of sense. And I think continuing to create alternative sources of capital, continuing to look at additional paths to growing our business is something that our platform allows us to do. And it's 1 that we are excited about, and we'll continue to push on.
Operator: Next question is from Brent Dilts with UBS.
Brent Dilts: So most of my stuff has been asked, but I did want to ask something. Your grocery sector exposures increased quite a bit in recent years. And I know that was intentional, but it's up to nearly 10% of rents. So maybe could you talk about how you're viewing that sector longer term, just given the wider adoption of online grocery delivery during the pandemic? I mean do you think -- like what we've seen so far is it's mostly local delivery from stores, but do you think there's any risk that disconnects from the customer's local store over time and maybe the grocery store becomes a little bit more challenged from an e commerce perspective?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Brent, I don't know if you go to a local grocery even in this environment, you still find them fairly full. And I'm not trying to be facetious here. It is deemed an essential retail and they have continued to perform. Having said that, the most important thing that we are trying to focus on is the fact that the operators that we want to do business with, they have an omnichannel strategy. If you look at the U.K. grocers that we have partnered with, they dominate the click and collect market, and they dominate the delivery services. And so most of the partners that we have. And if you sort of unpack the 10%, and it's not quite 10%, but it's getting there of our exposure. You'll find that all of the operators that we have done business with are -- substantially all of the operators that we've done business with tend to have this omnichannel strategy, very well-established or in the process of having it very well established. They have the [indiscernible] and the balance sheet to do so.  And I do think that, that is going to be the future of this particular industry, which is why we got very comfortable but it's not just the industry, but it's the operators that we have targeted within these industries that we have done business with. And they will be not only surviving but thriving in the new environment where potentially, there is going to be more click and collect or delivery services. So we feel very good about our specific exposure within this industry. I don't know if this was a question or not as to whether -- are we sort of getting up against our limits with 10%. I would say, no. Our investment policy allows us to go as high as 15%. And for certain industries, we can always go back to the Board and request exceptions. But of course, we have to put forth our thesis as to why it makes sense. But this is an industry we feel very comfortable with, Brent.
Brent Dilts: Okay. Yes, that makes sense. I was just curious what your longer-term thoughts were. And then just 1 other quick one. I don't know if you've really got much to say about it. But the power grid issues in Texas recently, you have decent exposure to that market. Anything we should expect there longer term? Or is it just a blip?
Sumit Roy: Well, it's -- I don't want to underplay what's happening in Texas. But thankfully, as far as our exposure in Texas is concerned, again, that's the advantage of having a triple net business is that it's largely being handled by the operators. And thankfully, the disruption was fairly short term. And so most of these businesses are going to be able to come back.  Yes, they may have some issues with product not making it through this blip, as you put it. But I don't see this as being a major issue for the specific clients that we have exposure to in Texas.
Operator: Your next question is from Spenser Allaway with Green Street.
Spenser Allaway: Just looking to total commitments for your development pipeline. I realize it's a small portion of your overall capital deployment, but it is fairly elevated versus historical norms. So I was just wondering if you could provide some color on how you're thinking about this bucket? Should we expect it to remain elevated? And what kind of stabilized yields are you underwriting?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Spenser, that's a great question. There's a reason why we have that sheet in our supplemental, and we want to lay it out as clearly as possible. This is another one of the avenues us to continue to gain exposure to certain clients and do it at a cap rate that is north of what you would be able to transact in the open market. And so it is about $160 million of commitment, $100 million of which is not funded yet. But if you look at the breakup, you will see that it's largely driven by 2 forward commitments we have on the non-retail side of the business. And so what that allows us to do is, again, enter into these contracts in a particular asset type that is trading super aggressively and be able to transact and get assets maybe 40, 50, 60 basis points north of where these assets would be trading have they been available today. And so I think that is part of the advantage of doing this. And this is, again, using our credit, using our scale and size to be able to get some of these assets at higher cap rates than what we would on the open market.  The other side of this is repositioning. I think it was Vikram, who had asked about, hey, how are you thinking about these assets from NPC. We have a history of being able to reposition some of our assets and be able to really capture and enhance our rent from the same exact location by simply repositioning these assets. And that is something we've been doing for a few years. They tend to be smaller dollar amounts.  But once again, we've given you that detail in the supplemental. And that will continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of our business. And I think as you've seen, the velocity of our lease terminations, et cetera, will only increase. And this part of our business, which we have seasoned over many years, will start to play a bigger, bigger role and will certainly, we hope, be a value-enhancing part of our business model.  And so I would love to see this business continue to increase within the parameters of what I just shared with you and help us create another source of value creation for the overall business.
Operator: Your next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird.
Wesley Golladay: Just got a quick question on dispositions. How is demand for the noncore assets for the tenants that are impacted by COVID? I know you were able to sell a theater this quarter. Do you know if that will stay a theater?
Sumit Roy: Not sure. But I think, Wes, we've talked about this again, some of these theaters are located in prime locations. And we've already shared with you that, look, we don't think that the footprint of the theater business, pre-pandemic is going to be exactly the same post pandemic. So there will be some level of rationalization. But the good news is there is a fair amount of demand for last mile distribution, and there's much more of a focus on development of multifamily, given some of the trends that we are seeing in some of these markets. So it is quite possible that these assets, given that they sit on potentially 10, 12, even 15 acres of land, could be repositioned to a higher and better use. But that question, Wes, I think, is going to be very specific to the particular location and where that particular theta falls in the performance rankings. And if it tends to be in the top 2 quartile, I would say that, yes, the likelihood of it remaining at theater is high. But if not, I could easily see it being repositioned.  Perhaps not easily but certainly repositioned.
Wesley Golladay: Okay. And then could you -- did you -- I don't know if you shared it already, but how much of the ABR is for tenants on cash accounting and what is the percentage collected from that tenant base? And are those mostly related outside of the theaters, mostly related to tenants that are in bankruptcy now?
Sumit Roy: Christie, do you want to take this one?
Christie Kelly: We have -- when we take a look, Wes, at our overall collections. I think I had mentioned this before that our collections are stable at 94%. 80% around collected rent is really as a result of the theater industry. And the remaining is really in regard to the health and fitness.
Operator: Your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: Sumit, sorry if you already covered this. But I heard you quote cap rates on a few levels. But when we look at your $3 billion-plus acquisitions, we would assume some good-sized portfolios incorporated in that. Can you speak to portfolio premiums right now versus one-off deals? And maybe if you can bifurcate if there are premiums between retail and industrial?
Sumit Roy: Yes. That's a very good question, Todd. What we had seen in -- even as late last year that there was a portfolio discount, not a portfolio premium. But there has -- we have seen a couple of portfolios come to market that have traded very expensively. And so I'm not quite sure where this trend is going to go, Todd. But -- and I think I mentioned this already that even some industries and some tenants that we had seen pre-pandemic are now trading at levels as a portfolio, 40, 50 basis points lower.  So it's tough to tell. I don't think it is a point that could be made across all industries and all operators. I do think that in most industries and especially the higher-yielding industries. If there's a portfolio transaction, you will tend to see a discount, not a premium. But in certain industries and the industries that are in favor today, we are certainly seeing a little bit of tightening. With regards to $3.25 billion, we are not underwriting to very large portfolio transactions. That is not part of our overall forecast, Todd. So if that were to happen, I think that would be above and beyond the numbers that we have shared with you. And so that, too, could be a potential tailwind for our business. As you might know, there are several public sale-leaseback transactions in the market, none of which are reflected in the numbers that we have shared.  With respect to cap rates, it is -- it has compressed. And it has compressed even over the last 5 months, 4 months. So whether it's retail here in the U.K. industrial, as you know, it's probably steady but still fairly aggressive cap rates. It's -- all has tended to become a lot more expensive today than it was 6 months ago.  In the U.K., thankfully, the cap rate market is a bit more stable. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's compressing. But it's funny, we tend to do certain transactions where we are the only ones who are engaging in conversations and then we will find 1 or 2 other potential buyers start to come in on subsequent transactions.  So this is an interesting acquisitions environment that we find ourselves in right now. And -- but we feel very good. Again, the advantages that we have, we feel like we'll be able to get more than our share of transactions done, and we will continue to do it as spreads that will be very favorable and will help us drive earnings growth.
Christie Kelly: Wes, I wanted to circle back on your question. Because I had the theater numbers in my mind. But you were asking about cash accounting. And I just wanted to let you know that right now, we have almost 50 clients on a cash basis. And just to give you some color, it's a little over $5.5 million of monthly rent exposure, for which over half of that is associated with the theater industry. Let me know if that helps.
Sumit Roy: Okay. Todd, any other questions?
Todd Stender: That's it for me.
Operator: Your next question is from John Massocca with Ladenburg Tallman.
John Massocca: First off, welcome to the earnings call, Christie. Thank you. I know we're getting a little long on the call here, so I'll keep it to 1 question. Has there been any change with regards to rent collection quarter-to-date in 1Q '21 versus, say, 4Q '20. I mean essentially, can you provide any color on any of these troubled industries or non-paying tenants? Are any of them starting to maybe pay that hadn't been paying in December, November, October?
Sumit Roy: Yes. I could probably help with that a little bit. I mean, if we take a look at year-to-date, the January recollection was relatively consistent with what we've been seeing in the past months towards that 94% range. And essentially, the theater industry is still the majority at approximately 80%. And we did see some pickup as it relates to health and fitness. And it's a little early for February. But overall, as we said at the start of the call, it's consistent and steady.
John Massocca: Okay. But the improvement you've seen so far this quarter has been largely on the health and fitness side rather than the theaters?
Christie Kelly: Like that, yes. But I would like to say too that theaters are paying.
Operator: Your next question comes from Katie McConnell with Citi.
Michael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman. Can you hear me?
Sumit Roy: Yes. We can hear you, Mike. This is what happens when I'm in the office. Katie is in Philadelphia. We have an associated home. Creates that lot merging that doesn't work too well sometimes. I was wondering if you can provide some perspective. Obviously, when you switch over from banking, you went to Duke as the CFO. And then with CBRE, you sit on Park Hotels, Kite Realty, Tiers Board. You came out to Realty Income board last year. Net lease and what Realty Income is very different from those other companies in terms of the type of business in terms of creating growth with this longer duration net leases really where the competitive advantage is the cost of capital. And obviously, the relationships that the company has. But the secret to this company is being able to access well-priced capital and finding the deals. Just talk about sort of your perspectives and how you think the company should be capitalized?  How you think about capital raising relative to your prior experiences? Certainly, Michael. It's great. Great to hear your voice again, and I look forward to seeing you in person. But I wasn't at CBRE. I was at JLL.
Michael Bilerman: Just a broker. Close enough.
Christie Kelly: But in terms of overall thoughts, Michael, you've known me for a long time. And I think that you really -- and obviously understand the triple-net lease business. Now really being competitive and leveraging our scale and thoughtfulness on the capital markets side is really, I think, what you seen from us historically, what you saw from us at the beginning of the year and what you can expect from us going into the future.  As Sumit mentioned, we're excited about what we're seeing in the U.K. in terms of the debt markets and what we can execute at. And should something come to fruition on the continent. We have a lot -- we have some very favorable aspects, we believe, on the continent from a debt perspective as well. And when we take a look at capitalization, I mean, you can expect us to protect our balance sheet and really be focused on that net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.5% -- 5.5x, as we mentioned, and really going forward in that regard. And sitting back, you mentioned some of those other businesses. I mean, as you know, Realty Income is just a fantastic business with a great team, and I'm really excited about joining the team.  We have a long runway ahead of us, great growth potential. And as Sumit's been mentioning some really exciting things to continue to add value to our clients.
Michael Bilerman: As you think about sort of cash flow growth, you talked a little bit about on the call of some of the industries that are having some issues and how that could sway guidance. But part of the weaker growth is the prefunding of a lot of the transaction volumes given the sheer amount of equity that you raised in the fourth quarter and earlier this year, how should we think about your cadence on equity because it is depressing current earnings should -- was that like a rebalance for '21? Or should we expect an acceleration of growth as we move through the year and into 2022 solely focused on the transaction side of the equation?
Sumit Roy: Not necessarily, Michael. I mean we were just taking advantage of the market at that point in time, and it was really an opportunistic play given the acquisition pipeline that we had in front of us. So you can expect us to still be managing our debt-to-equity equation thoughtfully in keeping with our A rating, but not being overly aggressive, if you will, to cause dilution.
Operator: Your next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.
Joshua Barber: Just wanted to see what the latest was on the 7-Eleven portfolio that's in the market and kind of your current feeling about if you would consider adding to your 7-Eleven exposure?
Sumit Roy: Joshua, I'll take that question. So we don't talk about specific transactions. You also can see that 7-Eleven is a top 10 tenant of ours. It's a client that we have done repeat business with. We help do their first sale-leaseback in 2016 and did subsequently 4 other sale leasebacks directly with them. So clearly, it's an operator. It's -- that we really like. It's in an industry that we like, and especially the standing that 7-Eleven has within the [indiscernible] store business, we really like their positioning. And so then the question becomes okay, what about the 11% industry exposures that you have to convenience store business. Is that a factor that could potentially curbed our ability to do more? And I think I've answered this question before, we have a limit of 15%, and we can always get exceptions in the event we can make the case that a particular industry is one that we are very favorable, we implying towards and would like to see it increase. And this is one of those industries that we would feel very comfortable in increasing our allocation to. But again, we have to be very specific that it's industry increase in allocation, but with particular clients in mind and 7-Eleven would that will be falling in that bucket.
Operator: Your next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.
Linda Tsai: In terms of acquisitions, what type of competition do you run into on larger portfolio deals? And who would be willing to take on tenant concentration to get some of these larger deals done?
Sumit Roy: Are you asking us about whether we would be willing to take the tenant concentration? Or is this a general question, Linda?
Linda Tsai: It's just more of a general question around competition. When you're looking at these larger portfolio deals, and maybe who some of the competitors are out there that would be willing to take on concentration?
Sumit Roy: Sure. So that's 1 of the things that we talked about, Linda, is the fact that we do have the size and the scale to absorb large portfolios. Now the way I would define large portfolios is $1 billion plus. Most peers would run into concentration questions doing half that size. Especially if they already have a preexisting exposure to that particular client. But we find ourselves in the enviable position of being able to continue to increase the allocation for a given client, and it's largely a testament to the size of our overall business and balance sheet. But clearly, when you start talking $5 billion, $6 billion, those are types of transactions that don't come very often. And when they do, outside of us, I don't know if there is any other public net lease buyer that could potentially entertain absorbing that sort of size.  Then in terms of who are the alternative buyers of this. It's largely driven by what is available on the financing side of the equation. And ABS has become a preferred mechanism of financing these large scale transactions, especially with highly rated operators. And then once those boxes are checked, you can pretty much assume some of the private equity folks getting involved and being super excited about playing in that size because they can put capital to work, and lever up the portfolio to, call it, 85%, 90% and be able to get very -- enhance their cash-on-cash yield. So that's the group that would be the traditional competition for very large sale-leaseback opportunities with highly rated operators.  But when interest rate starts to move in the direction that it has, then that does start to put pressure on some of these players because the cost of financing on that 80%, 90% leverage starts to creep up. So it really is going to have to be coupled with what we see in the financing market to help define who the potential competition could be.
Linda Tsai: Got it. And then just in terms of the cash basis tenants, what percentage did you collect from the cash basis tenants in 4Q and in 3Q?
Sumit Roy: Yes. I'll let Christie answer that.
Christie Kelly: We had a couple of million. Linda, I believe. Okay.
Linda Tsai: And then just for the 40 theaters that aren't on a cash basis, it sounds like we should assume they're paying some level of rent. For the 40, are they concentrated under 1 banner versus another? In your disclosure, you show 40 Regal and 32 AMC?
Sumit Roy: Yes. I can answer that. Yes, about 41 of these assets, when we did our internal analysis, we deemed them to be in this top quartile. And that's how we came up with the 41. But when we talked about us getting some rent from both AMC as well as Regal, especially in the month of December. It was across the entire portfolio. So even those assets, those 37 assets that we have on cash accounting, they paid us rent. Not 100%. But they paid us some rent for the month of December, and that's really the upside for us going forward.
Operator: At this time, this concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the conference over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.
Sumit Roy: So thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you at the upcoming virtual conferences. Take care. Bye-bye.
Christie Kelly: Thanks, everybody.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-03 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2020 Operating Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to now hand the conference over to your speaker today, Andrew Crum, Associate Director of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.
Andrew Crum: Thank you, all, for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter 2020 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Capital Markets and Finance. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you'd like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. As we remain in a remote work environment to promote the safety of our employees and community, I continue to be impressed by the resiliency and talent of our team to drive our business forward through the current pandemic. I also remain appreciative of the support and resiliency of our clients and partners, who continue to perform under difficult circumstances. On the personnel front, we were excited to announce that Christie Kelly has been appointed Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. And we look forward to Christie joining us in January. Christie's depth and breadth of experience with leading real estate companies will be immediately additive to our team. Over the last year she has been a valuable member of our Board of Directors and the Board's Audit Committee, which will further promote a smooth transition. I look forward to partnering with Christie to continue advancing Realty Income's strategy and objectives. Moving on to a summary of the quarter. During the third quarter we invested approximately $659 million in high-quality real estate including $230 million in the UK, which brings us to nearly $1.3 billion invested year-to-date. Investments during the quarter were primarily concentrated in the home improvement, convenience store and grocery store industries, each of which continue to perform well through the current environment. On October 1, we diversified our access and presence in the global capital markets as we closed on our debut public debt issuance of Sterling-denominated notes, raising £400 million in 10-year notes, with an effective annual yield to maturity of 1.71%. We are grateful for the support we received from the UK fixed income investors community, and we look forward to building on these relationships in the years to come. We took steps to further position our balance sheet for growth during the quarter, as we raised approximately $349 million of equity, primarily through our ATM program. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio at quarter end was 5.3 times, which is well within our target leverage ratio, and provides a significant financial flexibility moving forward. Based on the strength of our investment pipeline and our continued access to well priced capital, we're increasing 2020 acquisitions guidance to approximately $2 billion. Moving on to investment activity during the quarter. In the third quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $659 million in 89 properties located in 21 states in the United Kingdom, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.4%, and with a weighted average lease term of 12.7 years. On a total revenue basis, approximately 73% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment grade rated tenants or their subsidiaries. Of the $659 million invested during the quarter, $429 million was invested domestically in 82 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.9%, and with a weighted average lease term of 15.4 years. During the quarter, $230 million was invested internationally in seven properties located in the UK, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 7.5%, and with a weighted average lease term of 8.9 years. Year-to-date, we have invested approximately $1.3 billion in 180 properties located in 28 States and the UK, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.1 years. On a revenue basis, 56% of total acquisitions are from investment grade rated tenants or their subsidiaries. Of the $1.3 billion invested year-to-date $845 million was invested domestically in 167 properties, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. Year-to-date approximately $454 million was invested internationally in 13 properties located in the UK, at weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 10 years. Transaction flow remains healthy, as we sourced approximately $14.1 billion in the third quarter. Of this amount, $10 billion was domestic opportunities and $4.1 billion were international opportunities. Of the opportunity source during the third quarter, 53% were portfolios and 47% or approximately $6.7 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date we sourced approximately $46.6 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of the $659 million in total acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 44% were one-off transactions. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 164 basis points for domestic investments, and 328 basis points for international investments. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our investment pipeline remains robust, and we are well-positioned with strong financial flexibility to capitalize on opportunities going forward, resulting in our increased acquisition guidance. Moving to dispositions, during the quarter we sold 36 properties for net proceeds of $50 million, and we realized an unlevered IRR of 19.7%. This brings us to 65 properties sold year-to-date for $183.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6%. And we realized an unlevered IRR of 13.6%. Our portfolio remains well diversified by tenant, industry, geography and property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased to approximately 600 tenants in 51 separate industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the UK. Approximately 85% of rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at over 10% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.8% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remain our largest industry at 12.1% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to operate in a variety of economic environments, and to compete more effectively with e-commerce. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We remain constructive on the credit quality of the portfolio, with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.6%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the prior quarter. During the quarter, we re-leased 80 properties recapturing 99.2% of the expiring rent year-to-date - sorry, year-to-date, we re-leased 238 properties, recapturing 99.8% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,400 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Rent collection across our portfolio has remained stable. During the third quarter we collected 93.1% of contractual rent due, and we collected 92.9% of contractual rent for the month of October. Further improvements in rent collection percentages is primarily dependent on improvements in the theatre industry, which I will touch on shortly. Our collection rates are calculated as the cash rent collected, divided by the contractual rent charge for the applicable period. Charge amounts have not been adjusted for any COVID-19 related rent relief granted, and do include contractual base rents from any tenants and bankruptcies. We collected 100% of contractual rent for the third quarter from investment grade rated tenants, which further validates the importance of high-quality real estate portfolio leased to large well-capitalized clients. While we have not historically prioritized investment grade rated tenants as a primary objective, during periods of economic uncertainty, high grade credit tenants tend to provide more reliable streams of income as the last three quarters have proven out. Our top four industries, convenience stores, drug stores, grocery stores and dollar stores, each sell essential goods and represent approximately 37% of rental revenue. And we have received nearly all of the contractual rent due to us from tenants in these industries since the pandemic began. Uncollected rent continues to be primarily in the theater and health and fitness industries, as these industries account for approximately 80% of uncollected rents during the third quarter. As we continue to manage our portfolio to support long-term value creation, we believe the breadth and depth of our asset management and real estate operations department, which is our company's largest department is a key competitive advantage vis-à-vis our competitors. I would also like to update the investment community on our latest views on the theater industry. The industry represents 5.7% of our contractual base rent. And while we do expect the industry to downsize in the future, we continue to believe it will remain a viable industry in a post-pandemic environment, especially for high budget blockbuster movies. As a reminder, U.S. Box Office reached an all-time high as recent as 2018, and 2019 produced the highest grossing worldwide film of all time an Avengers: Endgame. Further, recent reports from China where over 80% of movie theaters are open, show that daily box office revenue has recovered to 2019 levels. Though we acknowledge that cultural nuances do influence theater attendance, it remains a relevant data point. We continue to believe particularly for blockbuster movies, that a theatrical release will be the preferred distribution channel for studios going forward, given the superior economics afforded to them versus the streaming platform. That said, we do recognize that the industry is changing, and that there will likely be a rationalization of theatres in a post-pandemic reality. Under this scenario, underperforming theatres may not survive. Near-term, there are several uncertainties facing the industry particularly around, when the major movie studios will feel comfortable releasing their films through the theatrical distribution channel. And with theaters in New York City and Los Angeles, the two largest markets in the U.S. remaining shuttered, we like others who follow the industry lack clarity as to whether studios will be inclined to release blockbuster films. As a result, our confidence level associated with the collectability of a portion of our outstanding theater receivables has diminished, and the near-term solvency risk facing the two largest operators in the space, AMC and Cineworld is incrementally more pronounced. To that end, we believe it is prudent to establish a full reserve for the outstanding receivable balance for 37 of our 78 total theater assets, and to move to cash accounting for revenue recognition purposes, for these 37 assets going forward. We deemed the collectability of rents for these 37 theater assets to be less than probable, based on a variety of factors including the store level performance of these assets. To be clear, we believe our theater portfolio is one of very high-quality, and we estimate that 82% of theatres in our portfolio are in the top two quartile of each operator's portfolio in terms of store level performance. Specifically, of the 72 theater assets that we have recent unit level financial information on, we estimate that 41 are in the top quartile, 18 are in the second quartile, 11 are in the third quartile, and two are in the bottom quartile, based on pre-pandemic EBITDAR performance. Our criteria to determine which of these assets to move to cash accounting was predicated on a holistic approach, based largely on these productivity rankings on a pre-rent and post-rent basis. We determined that 31 of these assets most of which were still profitable based on pre-pandemic financials, generated EBITDA that prevented us from deeming collection as probable. Of the remaining six assets for which we are reserving, we did not have access to unit level financial information to assess collectability. Thus, as a conservative measure, we reserve for those six assets as well. The financial impact of our theater reserves is $17.2 million of reserves recognized for these 37 assets, $1.6 million of which is straight line rent receivable reserve, and thus has no AFFO impact. The third quarter impact is approximately $0.04 per share diluted to AFFO, and $0.05 per share diluted to FFO. And going forward, we will not accrue revenue on these assets unless we actually collect the cash rent, all we determine collectability has become probable again. During the quarter, we recorded provisions for impairment of approximately $105 million, $79 million of which was associated with 12 theater assets. To arrive at the appropriate impairment for our theater assets, we analyzed the same 37 assets where collection probability was deemed less than probable. Of the 37 assets we analyzed, we determined that 12 assets had a probability weighted undiscounted cash flow that was less than the current net book value of the assets. Accordingly, we impaired the carrying value of these 12 assets down to their estimated fair value. As a reminder, provisions for impairment only impact net income and has no impact on the company's FFO or AFFO. Now I'd like to outline our current thoughts on the long-term outlook for our overall portfolio revenue stream, almost all of which we expect to remain intact in a post-pandemic world. As discussed, we do expect a level of rationalization in the overall theatre industry, which may require repositioning some of our properties. The theaters most likely to be impacted going forward would be a subset of the 37 properties, which we have moved to cash accounting, which in total represent $33.3 million of annual rent, or 2% of our annual rent. To be clear, we do not expect to lose the entirety of rent associated with these properties longer-term, even in the event of potential closures. Beyond the theatre industry, we continue to monitor select tenants in the health and fitness and restaurant industries in particular. Though the overall diversity credit and real estate quality of our portfolio gives us comfort that any longer-term rent loss would be fairly modest. Moving on, our same-store rental revenue decreased 4.4% during the quarter and 1.5% year-to-date. Our reported same-store growth includes deferred rent and unpaid rent that we have deemed to be collectible over the existing lease term, but similarly excludes rent where collectability is deemed less than probable. The decrease in same-store rental revenue is primarily driven by reserves we recognize in the theatre industry, and to a lesser extent the health and fitness industry. I will provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of rental and other revenue for the quarter was 4.3%. Our year-to-date G&A expense ratio excluding approximately $3.5 million of severance related to the departure of our former CFO was 4.5%. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, reflecting our best in class efficiency and the scale benefits afforded to us given our size. Our non-reimbursable property expense as a percentage of rental and other revenue was 1.9% for the quarter, and 1.5% year-to-date. AFFO per share during the quarter was $0.81, and $2.55 year-to-date. Our AFFO per share for the quarter was negatively impacted by the recording of non-straight line rent reserves of approximately $21.8 million during the quarter, which represented $0.06 per share of dilution. Year-to-date our AFFO per share was negatively impacted by non-straight line rent reserves of approximately $29.3 million, which represents $0.09 per share of dilution. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain one of only a handful of REITs with at least two A ratings. During the quarter we issued $315 million of notes due 2031 for an effective annual yield to maturity of 2.34%, and subsequent to quarter end, we completed a debut public offering of Sterling denominated senior unsecured notes for £400 million due 2030, for an effective annual yield to maturity of 1.71%. Additionally, we raised approximately $349 million of equity during the quarter, primarily through our ATM program. Year-to-date, we have raised nearly $2.7 billion of well-priced capital, including approximately $1.22 billion of equity, and $1.47 billion of debt. We ended the quarter with low leverage and strong coverage metrics with net debt to adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 5.3 times, or 5.2 times on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remains strong at 5.2 times. We continue to have very minimal net short-term borrowing, as $856 million outstanding on the line and through our CP program was largely offset with approximately $725 million of cash on hand. Looking forward, our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with less than $80 million of debt maturities through yearend 2021, excluding CP borrowings. And the weighted average maturity of our bonds is a healthy 8.2 years. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape, and we continue to have no leverage, strong coverage metrics and ample liquidity. In September, we increased the dividend for the 108th time in our company's history. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.5%. And we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 dividend aristocrat's index for having increased their dividend every year, for the last 25 consecutive years. In summary, we are confident in the overall resiliency of our portfolio, and believe our strategy of partnering with large, well-capitalized operators who are leaders in their respective industries will continue to be a successful strategy. The momentum in our investment pipeline, our ample sources of liquidity, and our size and scale position as favorably to capitalize on near-term growth opportunities. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nate Crossett from Berenberg. Your line is now open.
Nate Crossett: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe you could just characterize the deal flow heading into the end of the year. Guidance implies a further ramp into 4Q. So, some more color there would be helpful. Where's that weighted in terms of geographies, concepts? Are there any portfolios in there? And then comments on pricing would be helpful?
Sumit Roy: Sure. There's a bunch of questions in there, Nate. So, I'll try to take it one at a time. Look, I think during the second quarter earnings announcement, I had suggested that the pipeline was building up very strong, the sourcing data was incredibly high. And that momentum has continued in the third quarter based on almost $14.5 billion of sourcing. The good news with regards to this sourcing number is that it is fairly well distributed across geographies. I would say $10 billion or two-thirds of it was U.S., one-third is UK. And that mix has been fairly consistent throughout the year of the $47 billion odd that we've sourced. With regards to the product that we are pursuing and what the cap rate environment looks like. It is largely in what will be deemed as essential retail. So grocery stores, home improvement, convenience stores, dollar stores, there continues to be enough product within those sectors, that's keeping us busy. And again, especially on the grocery side, as well as to a lesser extent on the home improvement side, we continue to see both those industries very well represented in the UK. You talked about cap rates or pricing was a specific question. Look, we continue to see pricing cap rates compress, both here in the U.S. as well as in the UK. And this is across asset types, both on the industrial single tenant industrial side, as well as the high-quality retail assets that we are targeting and pursuing. I would say that investment grade rated retail today in the U.S. is in the low 5s to potentially even a four handle for certain assets. And it very rarely gets above a six cap. If you start to look beyond investment grade, yes, you will get in the low 5s to potentially in the low 7s. But there is very few products that we are pursuing that has a seven handle in front of it. And in the UK, the pricing is even more competitive. Especially on the grocery side, you'll find product on the retail side of the equation in the low to sort of 4.2% 4.3% zip code to the mid-5. On the single tenant industrial side across both the U.S. and UK cap rates have compressed, very good product with tenants that we would like to partner with, with long-term leases are trading in the low 4s. So it is a very expensive market. But this is where relationships and previous relationships with tenants and brokers and the folks that control some of the transactions, the developers et cetera that really comes to the forefront. And we feel very good about the pipeline that we've built. It's part of the reason why we were sitting on some cash in recognition of being able to finance right off of our balance sheet.
Nate Crossett: Okay, that's all very helpful. Thank you. Just quickly, if we go back into a lockdown, and I guess UK is going into a lockdown this week. What's the impact that you see on the pipeline? Is it different time around I guess is the question?
Sumit Roy: Yes, so I'll answer your UK question first, Nate. Again, what they are shutting down tends to be gyms, movie theaters, casual dining concepts, bars, et cetera. And we have no exposure to any of those industries, say for one theater in the UK. Most of our exposure happens to be in the grocery side of the business, and more recently, in the home improvement side of the business, which is deemed as essential retail and will continue to remain open. And these are the precise industries that have actually experienced tailwinds during this pandemic, because of some of the social distancing and stay at home norms that have been adopted by the consumer base. So, we feel pretty good about our portfolio and its ability to perform in the event of a prolonged shutdown in the UK. Here in the U.S., we've also sort of very much bookended where the risk lies, and it is primarily in the theater business, and that's the reason why we spend so much of the time discussing our thesis and walking you through why we've done what we've done in the theater side of the business. Outside of the theater business, its health and fitness to a lesser extent. And the issue of being able to continue to operate a fitness center at 50% capacity is not an issue in and of itself, because most of the time at the peak capacity levels, they rarely go above that 50%, 55% to begin with. And again, given our main two exposures in the health and fitness businesses to the Lifetime and LA Fitness, they continue to be largely open at this point. And I think in the month of October, we collected 83% of the rent. So, we feel that at least with this particular industry, we bookended the risk fairly well. But, look, if we go into a big shut down, I do think that, some of the other industries that were impacted casual dining, Daycare Centers, et cetera, they are much better equipped to handle a prolonged shutdown today than they were in the month of April. And we feel better about their ability to continue to use some of the avenues that they've created, i.e. click and collect, drive-thru, et cetera, as a method to continue to operate their businesses in a way where they can continue to pay us rent. So, the industry that I feel that is going to be - and it continues to be impacted is the theater industry. But outside of that, I think we feel pretty good about the operators we are exposed to in some of these other industries that that could be impacted. But we feel like they'll fare much better this time around than they did in April.
Nate Crossett: Okay, thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Katy McConnell from Citi. Your line is now open.
Katy McConnell: Okay, great. Thanks. Can you provide some color on the portion of larger portfolio deals completed this quarter, as far as pricing and tenant credit for those? And any other opportunities like that, that you're looking at today they've done market construction?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Sure, Katie. Look 55% of what we closed were portfolio deals in the third quarter. So, we continue to see a very healthy flow of portfolio transactions. And truth be told, that's what moves the needle for us, especially on the retail side of the equation. But the comment around cap rates continues to be true Katie, even portfolios are trading at more aggressive cap rates than they were six months ago. And we closed on a transaction in the third quarter with a client that we have a very good relationship with, and the cap rate we ended up paying on that particular portfolio was 20 basis points inside of where we did the previous sale leaseback with them on. And then subsequent to that, we've seen cap rates compress even further. And so yes, we have seen a very healthy pipeline of portfolio transactions and some staggeringly large portfolios are out there in the market. And it's public, in terms of, what they are. And so that's a very good situation for a company like ours, where we have the ability to write, do much larger transactions without running into concentration issues, and especially if it is with a relationship client and that has not abated. And it's not just a phenomenon that we're seeing here in the in the U.S. We are seeing portfolio transactions in the UK as well. And in fact, we ended up closing on a portion of a portfolio transaction that we did with one of our very good relationships in the UK in the third quarter as well. And so the momentum that we've been able to generate both here in the U.S. and the UK continues to be very strong. And that's what gives us the confidence of having increased our guidance by $500 million at the midpoint of our previous acquisition guidance.
Katy McConnell: Thanks for the color. And then just a quick follow-up. Could you talk about the progress you've made so far in the held for sale assets? And what you're seeing so far, regarding pricing indication? And do you expect a royalty of rent in the industry volume next year to sell down more of your high-risk exposure outside of figures?
Sumit Roy: Absolutely, Katie. I mean, we are already up to $186 million. And I think you can expect a similar run rate in the fourth quarter, which will be one of the larger disposition strategies that we've had or disposition amounts that we've had in the recent past. And the commentary on cap rates continues to be true on the disposition side of the equation as well. So of course, these are assets that no longer strategically fit the profile of our optimal portfolio, but there continues to be a market for it. And that's the reason why we were able to achieve such high double digit, high teen type unlevered IRRs, because the market is very conducive to sell into. And we will continue to do that going forward. But again, it's a story of two baskets, if you will. There's definitely a very healthy appetite for all of the industries that I've talked about as being essential retail, and cap rates are incredibly aggressive in that particular bucket. But if you look at assets in the health and fitness business, or if you look at assets in the theater business, there is no market right now. So, yes, we can continue to call our portfolio and evolve towards our optimal portfolio. But it's not a market where you can sell, essentially, any asset that you have, or you desire to sell. So, I think we have to take that into consideration as well.
Katy McConnell: Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Spenser Allaway from Green Street. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, thank you. This is Harsh, filling in for Spenser. Could you talk a little bit about your disposition activity, just building on that sort of the tenant or industry, or the particular geography that you're looking to exit from, which may not be strategically fitting with your portfolio rate?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So Harsh, I think, in trying to answer Katy's question, I talked about the volume, but I'll get a bit more specific. The assets that we are selling are, there was some grocery assets that we sold with operators that we didn't seem like fit our profile for the long-term, and we're able to get very aggressive pricing. All of the assets sold were here in the U.S. So I just want to make that point very clear. And then there were some assets that we've sold on the convenience store side of the business. And these tend to be formats, that, again, is not what we would be pursuing actively. So these are more like kiosks, 1,500 square feet boxes, with half an acre, with potentially tenants that don't quite have the credit profile that we would like to have long-term, there continues to be a market for those types of products and so we're selling those assets. And then of course, we sell a lot of vacant assets as well in this market. And despite the fact that we are in the midst of a pandemic there continues to be especially for well-located vacant assets, there continues to be an appetite amongst the developer community to come in and buy those fairly aggressively. And so that's the makeup of some of the assets that we've been selling. And another industry that I would throw in there is the restaurant business. So some of the assets that we've sold, happened to be in the restaurant business.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. And just talking about theater again. How many of the 37 theaters that forbids collection were deemed less than probable? I have leases that are expiring in the next two years. And then on that where that would impaired? Can you provide some more color on them, like the tenants they were leased to or geographies they were in, like within major city center or something like that?
Sumit Roy: Sure. So, the way we sort of went through the analysis, I think I went through it in a fair amount of detail, but I'll just be brief. On the 31 of the 37 assets, they happen to be two of them were in the top quartile of performance, 16 were in the second quartile, 11 in the third quartile, and two in the fourth quartile. And then there were six assets for which we didn't have financial information. And so that's the 37 assets that we deemed, as being ones that in a conservative scenario, if there was going to be rationalization in the theatre business, we couldn't say with a high probability of a collection that we'll be able to collect rent, and so we move them to cash accounting. Of those 37 assets, we did the impairment analysis, because anytime we move to cash accounting that's a trigger for impairment. 12 of those assets were deemed as being impaired. And there are several analyses that we go through when you compare the undiscounted cash flow to the net book value, and if it's less than the net book value, we take an impairment. And so those 12 assets resulted in $79 million of the $105 million of impairment. And then there was another asset that we had an office asset that resulted in about $18 million of impairment. And then that basically constituted the vast majority of the $105 million. The lease terms remaining on the portfolio on the entire theater industry, I think it's in the high single digits for both Regal as well as AMC.
Unidentified Analyst: That's helpful. Thank you so much.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank. Your line is now open.
Greg McGinniss: Hey Sumit. The average investment size in UK this year, it's over $30 million a property versus the $5.5 million in the U.S., which I imagine is just a function of focusing on grocery store acquisitions in the UK. And I'm curious is that the trend we should expect to continue regarding larger average asset size in UK index universal property types available or meeting your underwriting standards is more limited than in the U.S.?
Sumit Roy: That's a very good observation, Greg. And because we have very tightly defined parameters for what we are going to pursue in the UK, they tend to fall in one of two buckets, it's either going to be and mostly it's going to be in the grocery side of the equation, or it's going to be home improvement. And those boxes tend to be larger, and they tend to be very well located, they tend to be located in high demographic regions. And they have a price point of right around $30 million to $45 million apart. And then when you supplement that with industrial assets that we are also pursuing, again, very rigid standards. Those will tend to be even higher than that, 2x that in some cases. So that's the product mix that you're going to find us pursuing in the UK. And that's the reason why those price per property points in the UK are going to be much larger. Here in the U.S., obviously, we go after a lot of discrete quick service restaurants, et cetera, which could trade at $1.5 million per part. And so on average the $4 million to $5 million is the average per property that you find here in the U.S., but that's what drives the differences.
Greg McGinniss: Thanks. And then shifting gears thinking about industrial acquisitions. Now, I know you mentioned that cost of capital is an issue regarding execution. There are a couple peers in the net lease space that appear to be maybe somewhat more successful at closing industrial and like manufacturing deals this year, one of which focuses on sale leaseback in the space and another that's trying to make inroads. Are these deals that you're seeing and turning down? Or am I just kind of off the mark here on this comparison because we prefer a different asset or tenant space? Any new case and cover on why you may or may not be pursuing or sourcing certain deals will be appreciated?
Sumit Roy: Sure. And look, I don't want to speak to what our competitors are doing, Greg. But the assets that we are pursuing, with the operators that we are pursuing on the industrial side, yes, we have come across mid-6%, high-6% deals, but for a variety of reasons. And it's largely driven by where these assets are located or the tenant and the credit that the tenant has or the type of business that they are involved in. It just doesn't get us comfortable. And so we walk away from those transactions. The ones that we are pursuing, they happen to be in the zip code that I've shared with you with regards to pricing. And so it has been a bit challenging for us. And thankfully, we've got the cost of capital to pursue some not all of these transactions and that's what we're trying to do is be as clinical as we can, leverage the relationships that we have. But in some cases, pricing gets to a point where we just have to walk away.
Greg McGinniss: Okay, that's fair. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts from UBS. Your line is now open.
Brent Dilts: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So first, could you provide some color on how competition in the transaction market has evolved during the pandemic? And I'm specifically looking for maybe like how much capital you're seeing come in from outside the industry, places like private equity, pension funds, et cetera?
Sumit Roy: Yes, happy to answer that. At the very beginning, I want to say right around June, et cetera, when we were reengaging, I'll tell you that we were amongst the very few that was still active in the acquisitions market. And we certainly took advantage of that. In some cases, we had transactions that we had sort of suspended, just entering into the pandemic, those came back to us. And we were able to transact some of those at slightly higher cap rates, but very, very quickly that scenario has changed. And it has become far more competitive. Even though some of our public peers have not fully engaged in the acquisitions market, there is plenty of capital chasing product on the retail side, which is where the surprise has been. The industrial has been less surprising to us. Even though, over the last six months, we've seen pricing get fairly aggressive. And there, we do see a lot of international money chasing well located long-term leases. But the biggest surprise for us has been on the retail side. The product that we're chasing, it's not surprising that that should attract the preponderance of capital. And we have seen that, and so that I think is the main reason why cap rates have gotten compressed. And now it's pretty aggressive out there.
Brent Dilts: Okay, great. And then just sticking with the transaction market, how has bid-ask spreads changed during the year? And has there been a big variance by tenant industry?
Sumit Roy: Well, clearly transactions that are occurring. So, we just raised our guidance to $2 billion, approximately $2 billion. And so, this is obviously a testament to the pipeline that we have, transactions that we've already got over the finish line. I think, there's plenty of transactions that will get done. The fixed income market is obviously incredibly - the cost of capital in the fixed income market is incredibly low right now, it's very competitive. And so this is where, our ratings et cetera come into the forefront because if one-third of the financing is coming from there, our overall cost of capital does allow us to continue to play even though the markets have gotten aggressive. Clearly, there was a period where very, very few transactions were getting done. And this is the month of April, which is when everybody was trying to get their arms around the pandemic, et cetera. But I would say that lasted all of four to six weeks, and immediately after that, transactions got done. And they got done at higher levels in the month of June, July than they are getting down today.
Brent Dilts: Great. Thanks, Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Yes.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from line of Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Linda Tsai: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for the detail on the theatres. When you look at the pre-pandemic profitability for the 41 theaters not on cash accounting, what's your base case for how long the recovery takes to approach those prior levels?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Linda, that's a great question. And I wish I had an answer for you, I can't share with you that those 41 assets are obviously in the top quartile of performance. They all cleared EBITDA, which is post rent obligations, et cetera, north of $1 million per asset. And so, those were the best of the best assets that either of the two large operators have, that's part of our portfolio. And so, as to when can they get back to those levels, I did share with you that in China, even though they have some constraints in capacity, they're already at pre-pandemic levels. This is largely going to be a function of when the studios feel comfortable, releasing these assets to the theaters, and if they keep pushing the high budget content further in and further out, the further out, it will be when these assets when these theaters can generate that $1 million plus of EBITDAs. And right now this on December 24, we still have the Wonder Woman movie that is still scheduled to come out. The James Bond film got moved out to April of next year. If those start to remain, and if the content that has been pushed out next year does come in next year, and we have a vaccine over the next 60 days and people start to feel more comfortable about being able to go back to the theaters, I can see this rebounding fairly quickly. But the question remains there are so many ifs, right, when will the vaccine come out, when will the customers feel confident of coming back. And we have some data points to point to, we also believe that streaming is not going to be the preferred route for these high budget movies, just because the math doesn't play out. And so I think it really is directly tied to when the studios are going to release the content and the customers feel comfortable in being able to go back, and I think that's going to be a function of when we have a vaccine available. So, if those play out, I think very quickly thereafter, I can see these assets starting to go north of $1 million again.
Linda Tsai: Got it. And so are these better positioned theatres on percentage rents right now?
Sumit Roy: So a lot of these assets we have basically constructed through sale leasebacks that we entered into with both Regal as well as with AMC. And these were assets that AMC and Regal used to own on their balance sheet. And so they tend to be the better performing assets anyway. And what we have continue to do is to invest, we invested with them when they change the format to accommodate the better seating and the stadium seating and the food and beverage, et cetera. And as part of that, we entered into percentage rent, participation with some of these operators. And so, I don't have the precise number in terms of how many of these assets are on percentage rent, but I do know that, as part of entering into a capital contribution to repurpose some of these assets, we did have percentage rental.
Linda Tsai: Thank you. And then just one follow-up. In terms of the subset of the 37 assets that would be up for repositioning. What are some alternative uses?
Sumit Roy: Yes, and that's why we continue to be positively surprised, Linda. So, unsolicited, we received some feedback on one of our theater assets where a developer shared with us that it could be positioned to a mixed-use multifamily side, it's very well located. Another one was identified as a potential last mile distribution center, because these tend to be 12, 13 acres parcels and so you could easily create 100,000 square foot last mile distribution center. Now, of course, you have to go through zoning, et cetera. But we feel that, because of where these assets are located, they can be repositioned and we will come out. Okay, it's just a matter of time and commitment and capital commitment. But unsolicited, the feedback we've received so far, because people are all tracking what's happening in the theatre business. We feel that we've come out okay, in the event that we need to position some of these assets.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Massocca from Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is now open.
John Massocca: Good afternoon.
Sumit Roy: Hi, John, how are you?
John Massocca: Good. How about yourself?
Sumit Roy: Good.
John Massocca: Hopefully, it doesn't sound a question. Can you maybe touch on theaters? If an operator went into bankruptcy, would that move all the theaters lease the tenant that was bankrupt? But those theaters that hadn't been put into this kind of cash accounting bucket, would that move them into cash accounting? Essentially, what is the potential for kind of another one-time hit the AFFO something does happen to Cineworld or AMC?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Look, if they cease to exist, there is no doubt. They file Chapter 11. Chapter 11 filing in and of itself is not a triggering event. It's just like, what are they planning and doing? What's their path forward? But if it switches over into Chapter 7, then clearly, we're going to write off even the 41 assets that is not on cash accounting, right now, we immediately shift to cash accounting on that. So that's the quick answer on what you just suggested. And that is the reason why we are continuing to monitor AMC came out. I think it was yesterday, maybe we want to raise another $15 million through the ATM program. But this is about what's going to happen first, if they run out of liquidity, and they can't find alternative sources of capital. And this could become a very different kind of discussion. But the question that we keep asking ourselves is, how will the studios that have made the shift to producing these high budget films, they're making fewer films today and 60% of what they are making tends to be this high budget movies? How can they replicate the profitability model that they have through the theatrical distribution channel? We can't see that being replicated in PPOD [ph]. So time will tell, but yes, if situations change, and they do go down the path of filing, then we will have to revisit our analysis.
John Massocca: Okay. And then touching on Nate's question from way back earlier in the call, and sorry, if I missed the responses. How does a lockdown a second lockdown in UK potentially impact deal flow? If at all, I mean 2Q UK deal flow fell to little over $50 million. Could that happen again? Or was that moving more reaction to some of the financial market uncertainty and pricing uncertainty rather than structural problems, the closing deals associated with the lockdown?
Sumit Roy: The product that we're pursuing there's plenty of product on the grocery side, there is plenty of product on the single tenant industrial side. So there are funds that are going full cycle, they recognize that there's a market for essential retail, those have continued to do well. So we don't see the product that we are actively pursuing, necessarily dry up, because of the Prime Minister shutting down UK again. And I think, I've made the comments already on the industries that are being shut down. We are not pursuing those in the UK. So that does not impact us. And so I think we'd be okay. And it's a similar story here in the U.S. Even in the midst of the previous lockdown, there was product, I think there was this small window where everything was - there was a slight pause in the market, but then very quickly thereafter the product velocity took off and we started getting really busy, getting inbounds and seeing transactions that we wanted to pursue. So I think it'll be similar. And the big difference between now and then is that operators are better prepared, which doesn't mean that they're not going to feel some pain, but they're just better prepared to handle it. Casual dining is better prepared. Daycare centers are better prepared in terms of the operators, certainly quick service restaurants are better prepared. So I think it's going to be different. And unless there's a mandate that none of these facilities will be allowed to remain open, which could happen, but which a small probability of happening, I think these businesses will be okay.
John Massocca: But is there a potential shift deal flow from maybe 4Q to 1Q or 1Q '21 to 2Q '21?
Sumit Roy: No, actually the 4Q numbers I think are - we are in the beginning of November, it's largely established at this point. So the question will really be if there is some hiccup in the market and sourcing dries up, which again, I want to reiterate, we don't see happening. But if it were to happen, it would probably impact some of first quarter 2021, second quarter 2021. Because you start to build up the portfolio today to close on assets in the first quarter of next year. And so far, so good.
John Massocca: Very helpful. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Joshua Dennerlein: Hey, Sumit. Hope you're well. I was curious about your strategy on the issuing in Sterling debt market going forward. And why you kind of chose that market through the linked bond [ph] issuance?
Sumit Roy: Sure. How are you, Joshua?
Joshua Dennerlein: Good, fantastic.
Sumit Roy: So I'll tell you, it's very difficult to look at that particular market, when we are buying assets in that market and not match funded with the local currency. For us, it makes perfect sense. And then, obviously, even when we did our first sale leaseback that sort of got us into the UK with Sainsbury's, we try to match fund it with £300 odd million of local denominated British pounds. And even though we had to go down the 144 path to get there, the reason for doing that was essentially to match fund and not have to worry about trying to enter into cross currency hedges, et cetera, which we did on the remainder. But in doing so we left some economics on the table. And for us, we feel that the product that we are pursuing then has a profile that needs to be warranted with the cost of capital that we can raise there. And we would be a miss if we didn't take advantage of the fact that we have two A credit rating, and we can issue similar tenured paper at potentially 50 basis points, 60 basis points inside of what we can issue here in the U.S. And so our all-in cost was 1.7%. We have assets that have 10-year ship north of 10 years, in fact, on a portfolio basis, it's well north of that. And to be able to match fund it with £400 million at 1.71% all in costs, that just allows us to create more value for our shareholders. So that was the rationale.
Jonathan Pong: Yes. Josh, I would just add. This is Jonathan. This is something that we were looking to do very early in the year and obviously, the pandemic hit. And we were patient, we weighted towards a point in time where the market covered, there's certainly a dearth of supply in the Sterling bond market. Pricing had recovered to a point where on an indicative basis, we're able to execute well inside of where 10-year U.S. paper would have priced. And then obviously, just the diversification of our investor base on the fixed income side and it's very high-quality order book. That was a strategic goal of ours for quite some time going all the way back to 2019, when we first entered the UK market. So it all kind of came together fairly nicely when it did.
Joshua Dennerlein: Awesome. I appreciate that guys. I'll leave the floor. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Josh.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-04 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Keisha, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2020 Operating Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would turn the call over to Mr. Andrew Crum, Associate Director of Realty Income. You may begin.
Andrew Crum: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income’s second quarter 2020 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Capital Markets and Finance. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company’s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question when they turning to Q&A portion of the call, in order to get everyone the opportunity to participate. If you’d like to ask additional questions, you may re-enter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. I’d like to start by expressing my gratitude and appreciation towards my colleagues, whose resiliency and determination to remaining extremely productive in the face of the current pandemic continues to drive our business. We are one team, and all employees have embraced this concept through effective communication and collaboration while working remotely. Further, we empathize with the individuals and businesses impacted by COVID-19 and we continue to partner with our clients to seek mutually beneficial outcomes. Our operating results for the second quarter continue to demonstrate the stability and resiliency of our business as we generated AFFO per share of $0.86 and ended the quarter with a portfolio occupancy of 98.5%. During the quarter, we invested over $154 million in high-quality real estate, including $58 million invested internationally in the UK, which brings us to $640 million invested year-to-date. Our quarter end to date – end net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.1 times positions us well going forward with significant financial flexibility. While uncertainty remains due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our business, which primarily focuses on owning real estate leased to essential retail and industrial tenants continues to perform well. Rent collection since hitting a low of 84.9% in May has steadily improved. And as of July 31, we have collected 86.5% of contractual rent for the second quarter. We have collected 99.1% of contractual rent for the second quarter from investment-grade-rated tenants, which further validates the importance of a high-quality real estate portfolio leads to large, well capitalized clients. While we have not historically prioritized investment-grade-rated tenants as a primary objective, during the periods of economic uncertainty, high-grade credit tenants tend to provide more reliable streams of income as the last few months have proven out. For the month of July, we have collected 91.5% of contractual rent, which represents the second consecutive month of improved rent collection and the highest monthly rent collection since the pandemic began. Uncollected rent continues to be primarily in the theater, health and fitness and restaurant industries as these industries account for approximately 81% of uncollected rent during the second quarter. Importantly, we continue to expect to collect the vast majority of uncollected rent as we continue to consider and negotiate rent deferral agreements on a case-by-case basis. We disclosed in our financial supplement the percentage of contractual rent collected by industry. Our top four industries: convenience stores, drug stores, dollar stores and grocery stores, each sell essential goods and represents approximately 37% of rental revenue. And we have received almost all of the contractual rent due to us from tenants in these industries for the second quarter. Other industries, such as theaters, health and fitness and restaurants have been challenged due to store closures and social distancing guidelines, but we are encouraged by improved rent collection in recent months. We remain constructive on the long-term viability of these industries, particularly given our partnership with the top operators in each of these verticals. The success of the theater industry has largely been tied to the quality of films produced by Hollywood, and the U.S. box office reached an all-time high as recently as 2018. Additionally, the economic business model for studios continues to suggest, in our view, that the theater distribution channel will remain attractive going forward. We also expect the non-discretionary and low price point propositions of the quick service restaurant and health and fitness industries to support resiliency of their rent paying capabilities, particularly as their businesses begin to reopen in certain areas of the country. As we continue to manage our portfolio to support long-term value creation, we believe the breadth and depth of our asset management and real estate operations department, which is our company’s largest department, is a key competitive advantage vis-a-vis our competitors. Moving on to investment activity during the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $154 million in 32 properties located in 15 states and the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of a 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.8 years. On a total revenue basis, approximately 41% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment-grade-rated tenants. 100% of the revenues were generated from retail tenants. These assets are leased to 14 different tenants in eight industries. We closed six discrete transactions in the second quarter and approximately 9% of second quarter investment volume for sale-leaseback transactions. Of the $154 million invested during the quarter, $96 million were invested domestically in 30 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 12.8 years. During the quarter, $58 million was invested internationally in two properties located in the UK at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 9.9 years. Year-to-date, we’ve invested $640 million in 94 properties located in 25 states in the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average initial lease term of 13.6 years. On a revenue basis, 37% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade-rated tenants, 97% of the revenues are generated from retail and 3% are from industrial assets. These assets are leased to 29 different tenants in 17 industries. We closed 23 independent transactions year-to-date and approximately 22% of year-to-date investment volume for a sale-leaseback transaction. Of the $640 million invested year-to-date, $416 million was invested domestically in 88 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.3 years. Year-to-date, approximately $224 million was invested internationally in six properties located in the UK at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.8 years. Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $14.5 billion in the second quarter. Of the $14.5 billion sourced during the quarter, $9 billion was domestic opportunities and $5.5 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 65% of the volume sourced for the second quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 55% were portfolios and 45% or approximately $6.5 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $32.6 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, $19.3 billion were domestic opportunities and $13.3 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 49% of the volume sourced year-to-date. Of the $32.6 billion sourced year-to-date, 56% were portfolios and 44% were one-off assets. Of the $154 million in total acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 41% were one-off transactions. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital during the quarter averaged approximately 131 basis points. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Looking forward, our investment pipeline remains robust, and we are well positioned with strong financial flexibility. Accordingly, we are reinstating 2020 acquisition guidance with a range of $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion. Moving on to dispositions. During the quarter, we sold 12 properties for net proceeds of $7.4 million and we realized an unlevered IRR of 6.1%. This brings us to 29 properties sold year-to-date for $133.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.2% and we realized an unlevered IRR of 10.5%. Our portfolio is well diversified by tenant, industry, geography and property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased to approximately 600 tenants in 50 different industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the UK. 84% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at approximately 11% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6% rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 12% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We continue to believe these characteristics allow our tenants to operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete more effectively with e-commerce. These factors have been particularly relevant in today’s retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to feel good about the credit quality in the portfolio with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.7 times on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.5 times. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.5%, consistent with the prior quarter. During the quarter, we released 65 properties, recapturing 101.4% of the expiring rent. During the first half of 2020, we released 158 properties recapturing 100.1% of expiring rents. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold over 3,300 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. Our same-store rental revenue decreased 0.4% during the quarter and 0.2% year-to-date. Our reported same-store growth includes deferred rent and unpaid rent that we have deemed to be collectible over the existing lease term. The decrease in same-store rental revenue is primarily driven by write-offs, we recognized in the restaurant industry as well as partially due to a change in methodology, as we are now recognizing percentage rent during the period it is accrued rather than during the period it is paid. Moving on, I’ll provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter, starting with income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of rental and other revenue for the quarter was 4.8%. Our year-to-date G&A expense ratio excluding approximately $3.5 million severance related to the departure of our former CFO, was 4.6%. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, reflecting our best in class efficiency and the scale benefits afforded to us given our size. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of rental and other revenue was 1.4% for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. AFFO per share during the quarter was $0.86, which includes approximately $60.2 million or $0.17 per share on a fully diluted basis of deferred and unpaid rent that we deemed earned during the period and probable of being collected during the existing lease term. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain only a handful of REITs with at least two A ratings. During the quarter, we issued $600 million of senior unsecured notes due 2031 within effective yield to maturity of 3.36%. And subsequent to quarter end, we add an additional $315 million at an effective yield to maturity of 2.34% blending out to just shy of 3% for the entire $950 million of notes. Additionally, we raised approximately $98.1 million of equity during the quarter, primarily through our ATM program. Year-to-date, we have raised over $1.8 billion of well-priced capital, including approximately $874 million of equity and $950 million of debt. We ended the quarter with low leverage and strong coverage metrics, but the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.1 times and the fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.4 times. We continue to have very strong liquidity with approximately $400 million of cash on hand and $2.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility as of July 31, which provides us significant financial flexibility. Looking forward, overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, as a weighted average maturity of a bond is 8.3 years. Additionally, we have nest in $140 million of debt coming due through 2021. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and ample liquidity. In June, we increase the dividend for the 107 time in our company’s history. We have increased our dividend every year since the company’s listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.5%. And we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, but having increase the dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. Moving on, we have always managed the business with a focus on economic resiliency and generating stable and increasing cash flow through a variety of economic environments. And we continue to do so through the current climate of uncertainty driven by COVID-19. We deliberately designed a high quality real estate portfolio leased primarily to tenants providing non-discretionary or low price point goods or services, as well as with the focus on partnering with large well-capitalized operators who are leaders in their respective industries. Our judicious balance sheet management and the strength of our financial position are evidenced by 2A credit ratings and our current financial flexibility and liquidity positions us favorably to capitalize and growing opportunities going forward. And we have reinstated 2020 acquisitions guidance with a range of $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion. At this time, I’d like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Shivani Sood from Deutsche Bank.
Shivani Sood: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Touching on the investment pipeline, I’m just curious, in terms of potential acquisitions, the depth of the buyer pool that you’re seeing out there in terms of competition. And how it compares to pre-COVID levels? I guess, is it mostly public buyers or private and has it been different for larger portfolio transaction?
Sumit Roy: Yes, it’s a very good question, Shivani. The way to answer it is, for the high quality essential retail product, the competition for that product remains fierce. And in fact, it’s translating into cap rates that I would say has tightened vis-à-vis pre-COVID levels. And so in terms of number of potential buyers, looking at that product continues to be very strong. I would say that we don’t see as many public net lease companies in the space today. And this is an overall comment as we did pre-COVID. But given what we’ve heard in the recent second quarter earnings announcement, I expect that that’s going to change. But at least over the second quarter and in transactions that we pursued more recently, the number of public buyers tend to be less. On the international side, however, the number of buyers and most of the time we’re competing with private institutes has continued to be very strong. And in fact, there have been occasions where we walked away from transactions that were right down the fairway for us, but because of pricing getting very, very competitive. So in general, I would say that all the products that we are pursuing the competition remains strong and I expect that most of the public net lease buyers are going to stop playing in that space sooner now.
Shivani Sood: And then as a follow-up, in terms of the reinstated investment guidance, could that strengthen the UK markets suggest that more those investment volumes to be sourced in the U.S. versus the UK. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure. Look, I think the UK market and I’d say the overall European market has continued to be a very strong source of growth for us. There were about $650 million worth of sale lease back opportunities that basically take all of the criteria that you’d be looking for outside of pricing. And given our disciplined approach to acquisitions, we chose to not continue to pursue those transactions. And if you look at the sourcing numbers, of the $34 billion, $13 billion was – has been sourced internationally. And that is well above what we had originally anticipated when we went into the UK market. And so the product remains strong in the international markets. I would say that even here in the U.S., our sourcing numbers is a testament to it. There remains plenty of products, both on the sale lease back side of the equation, as well as on the one off market. And the reason why we felt very comfortable reinstating our acquisition guidance is a testament to the pipeline that we currently have. The discussions that we currently have with our relationship tenants and what we are seeing on the sourcing side of the equation.
Shivani Sood: Thanks very much for that color.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nate Crossett with Berenberg.
Nate Crossett: Can you guys hear me?
Sumit Roy: There’s a bit of static, but we can hear you.
Nate Crossett: You guys mentioned that you’ve seen some tightening for the high quality product. Obviously, you guys have a lot of it. I’m just wondering if you guys are considering selling some of it into this attractive pricing and maybe you’re redeploying that capital elsewhere.
Sumit Roy: Look, our business philosophy has been that the products that we like we would like to hold it forever, and I’m being a bit facetious there. But the idea being that, trying to time the market and sell when we believe that the cap rates are low and et cetera. Doesn’t always play out and our history has proven that if we hold onto assets and continue to work with our partners or whom these assets are deemed critical, we will create value and we will create value with less volatility and of equivalent nominal terms. And that has sort of proven out to be the case, but that’s not to say that opportunistically, we won’t take advantage of the market like we did in the first quarter, where on the consumer electronic side of the business, we decided to sell the assets back to our tenants with whom we were having discussions of looking at other opportunities. But also looking to, to potentially help them address some of their own objectives, and we were able to generate 11% unlevered IRR based on selling those assets back. But our philosophy is, let’s buy the assets that work for our tenants. Let’s get into very long-term leases with minimal to zero capital invested in those assets. And we will create value, especially, if it continues to work for our tenants. And that continues to be our philosophy.
Nate Crossett: Okay. That’s helpful. And then just one on the pipeline, I was wondering, if you guys could just give a little color on how much of it is retail versus industrial. And then The same in the UK, you mentioned $13 billion sourcing, just curious how much of that is retail versus industrial?
Sumit Roy: Yes. I would say the vast majority is retail. It’s not to say that we are not seeing industrial. Those are the only two products that we are really looking at right now, Nate. But I would say, anywhere between 60% to 70% of what we are sourcing is on the retail side of the ledger. And 30% to 40% is going to be on the industrial side. Look, it’s no secret. We want to grow the industrial portion of our asset type. It’s something that we are very much focused on. We have made a concerted effort to cultivate relationships with folks, who could potentially provide us with this product. And it is starting to take shape and we are being able to generate some transaction flow from that side of the business, but what’s keeps us a little bit on the sidelines, continues to be the fact that our cost of capital is not quite where it was four months ago. And if that were no longer a constraint in terms of the product itself and what’s available. There is plenty of very good product in the industries that we want to participate in with operators that we would love to grow our relationship with. And so yes, it’s about 60% to 70%, 30% to 40% is the split.
Nate Crossett: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi.
Christy McElroy: Hi, thank you so much. Sumit, just a follow-up on those comments and your comments on balance sheet and capital raising. Just in terms of your desire to do more of these deals. From a capital raising standpoint, you recently issued debt, you did an equity raise earlier this year or you just did some more on the ATM, but you tend to run at a conservative leverage level. So as you think about doing more deals and you mentioned cost of capital just from a funding standpoint, what should we expect in terms of further equity raises in the context of your guidance?
Sumit Roy: Yes, that’s a good question, Christy. We believe that we can get to the midpoint of our guidance without having to necessarily rely upon the equity market – the capital markets. And still stay within what we would deem as conservative what our rating agencies would deem as being in line with the ratings that we have. Having said that, our hope is that with continued positive results on the operating side of the business and continuing to post information that will allow our cost of equity to improve that opportunistically, we will be happy to continue to raise equity capital. But the point I want to leave you with is, we don’t have to do that. Part of the reason why we entered 2011 and we did the very large equity raise was to get in a situation, where we had created enough of a capacity and had under leveraged our balance sheet coming out in March, where if we needed to lean on the debt capital markets, which seem to have corrected a lot sooner than the equity markets have, we could lean on that side of the equation and still stay within levels that, that our rating agencies would continue to support the 2 A ratings. So that’s where we are.
Christy McElroy: And then just to follow-up on your comments on theater. Just to two things really, how much of the theater and non-payment of rents could ultimately turn into vacancy in your view. And then just from a broader perspective, you talked about the economic model, what are your thoughts on that economic model changing in light of the recent AMC universal deal and other deals that could follow that in terms of theater operator’s ability to pay the kind of rent that they’re paying today?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Look, let’s talk about AMC. We’ve just agreed to terms of AMC. They started paying partial rent in the month of July, which was a very good signal to us. We’ve entered into a payback on the deferred rent that we’ve entered into. And the payback is going to be longer. It’s going to have – the average payback is going to be 2.7 years. But the fact that we were able to enter into an agreement with AMC, the fact that they were able to start paying us rent for the month of July. These are good signs. Look, we’re seeing the same thing that you’re seeing. The advantage that we have is we can pick up the phone and we can have a conversation with the AMC. And what they’ve shared with us with regards to the agreement that they’ve entered into with Universal is the basic premise for them doing this. Was that they believe that within the first 17 days, they get 75% to 90% of the box office revenues. And for the blockbusters, they generate 90% of the receipts within the first three weeks. So they didn’t believe that there would be significant cannibalization since the movie will be advertised as PVOD only after the first two weeks of the theatrical release. And the fact that they also get a share of the PVOD revenues is another source of revenue stream that gave them comfort. But the basic premise was that the economic pie in entering into this sort of an agreement is actually going to increase for both parties. And so listen, time will tell, we’ve run our own scenarios based on the information that AMC has shared. And at the corporate level, we believe that, they’ll be either at 0% to negative 5% of the profitability creating this arrangement. And so we’ll see. But they at least feel confident enough to have entered into an agreement with us. They started paying showing – they’ve started paying rent for the month of July partial rent. But all of that continues to help support the thesis that we have that the AMC should come out, okay. Based on our own independent analysis, Christy, we think that they will be fine through November, even in the scenario where they have zero openings. And then obviously if we – if this slowdown continues and more and more theaters are shut down or they’re unable to open that theaters as they’ve shared with us, which is August 20th, they would like to start opening up some of their theaters. Then of course, there’s a chance that they’ll might come back and ask for more different grants. But that’s the way we are currently. And this is an analysis that we are doing on a month to month basis, which is primarily the reason why we took the $8.5 million of write-off for the second quarter. So we continue to believe that this is from an industry perspective, the theater business is a sound business, but certainly going forward, if you look at our overall portfolio, we are revisiting in terms of what percentage of our overall portfolio should theaters constitute.
Michael Bilerman: But Sumit, don’t you – it’s Michael Bilerman speaking. You don’t share in the revenues that when I am going to stream the Universal movie in my house, there is a certain percentage of the revenues that this industry is producing that as a landlord to the box you don’t have, right? So doesn’t it ultimately diminish the value of a feed or a box that you own, right? So shouldn’t it have a higher cap rate and lower rent? Just because the revenues that are going to be generated in that box are not what they used to be? Putting aside the whole COVID thing, right? This just – this goes to the original issue with theaters, which was PVOD was increasing. And now we’ve had a massive change going from 75 to 17 days that nobody expected.
Sumit Roy: Yes. And Michael, that might turn out to be exactly the case. And from a theater perspective, I think you’re right. The actual box will potentially be generating less profitability for EMC, the corporate. But here’s the other piece that I want us to contemplate. And listen, these are all pieces that we are putting out and we are trying to run numbers, et cetera. But if you look at the math associated with something that is shown in the theater versus PVOD, even for the studios, the math is not going to pencil if it is PVOD only. The vast majority of their profitability comes from getting that 55% to 60% of revenues that are generated at the theaters. And it is much more for these big blockbuster movies, which tends to be where Hollywood is migrating towards. And I think this arrangement is more for movies that potentially are not quite as popular, its lower budget, how do we continue to maximize the revenue and perhaps PVOD is a better way to maximize that piece of movies that are being generated by studios. And so really, based on the conversations, we’ve had, the idea here is that this is going to allow the studios to become more profitable, but it should also at the very least make theaters at the corporate level. Either home or potentially participate in some upside. And at least, the studios become healthier. They’ll be able to generate better movies and be able to generate big tent movies, and that should translate to better content for the theater industry. But this is a thesis. So I get your concern, Michael. We are following this very closely and we’ll see how all of this plays out.
Michael Bilerman: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.
Nick Yulico: This is Greg McGinniss on with Nick. Sumit, the guiding level of acquisitions, inclusive or exclusive of any potential portfolio deals. And how do you think about your ability to underwrite those $200 million plus transactions given the number of tenants and leases in this more uncertain environment?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So even where we are today, Nick, I think we feel you’re not super excited about our cost of equity, but our overall cost of capital still will allow us to continue to chase transactions that we otherwise believe checks all of the boxes. In terms of the industries, we want to focus on the operators within those industries, we want to be in and the real estate asset type. And that hasn’t changed. What gave us confidence in being able to put out the acquisition numbers was really our pipeline. And the number of inbounds that we started to get over the last two and a half, three months. And the fact that, the volatility that was that we saw earlier on in the quarter, where our stock could move 8%, 9% on a day that seems to have gotten a bit more benign. It gave us the confidence to be able to go out and say, based on the pipeline we’ve created, based on the discussions we having, that we’ll be able to hit that $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion acquisition number. And our ability to do $200 million portfolio deals has not changed and the fact that we are today under leveraged. I think allows us to not have to rely on the most volatile of biggest component of our capital stack, which is equity. We can just lean on the debt side of the equation, it seems to have normalized considerably since the earlier month. And be able to finance our acquisition. So having that optionality is obviously what gave us a confidence to be able to go out with a number that we feel likely to need.
Nick Yulico: Okay. So the portfolio deals may be included within the guidance number at this point.
Sumit Roy: Absolutely. Sorry. I didn’t answer that directly. That’s correct.
Nick Yulico: Okay. Thanks. Shifting gears a little bit, just given the current presidential polls by looking to go after 1031 exchanges and the tax plan. Would you expect the removal of white kind exchanges to have a measurable impact on the business or maybe the types of assets that you look to acquire?
Sumit Roy: I wouldn’t use the word measurable, but yes on the margin, do I expect you to have an impact, absolutely. We don’t necessarily compete with 1031 buyers too much maybe on the quick service restaurant side of the business. We will run into some of these buyers on a one off transaction, but by and large, we are buying portfolios, even smaller portfolio transactions. And we have all of the usual suspects that are not 1031, who play in that market. Then switching over to the disposition market. Most of our dispositions tend to be vacant assets and you don’t see 1031 buyers playing in that particular market. It tends to be developers or tenants who want to own their own space, who tend to play in that particular market. So the only area where we might see them is sending occupied assets on a one off basis. And that doesn’t end to be a big part of our overall portfolio.
Nick Yulico: Great. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: And our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors.
Spenser Allaway: Thank you. In terms of the rent deferrals, you guys granted to tenants so far this year. Has any of the terms changed since first negotiated and/or have any tenants indicated that they would be paying back run ahead of the original payback period?
Sumit Roy: Yes, actually – so I’ll answer your first question. Second part of your question first, Spenser, that’s, okay. We’ve been sharing our monthly collection information pretty much on a monthly basis. And if you recall, when we first came out with April rents we had said it was 82.9% today. It’s tracking at 88.4% for me rented with a similar trend. We originally came up with 82%. Today, it’s at 84.9%. But similarly with June, we were at 85.7% and today it’s at 86.1%. So in each one of these months, what happened was we’ve had some of our tenants who went back and made us home. Some of them were on from the, on the restaurant side of the equation. Some of them were health and fitness businesses, and some were data centers that basically decided to make us hold for the month of April, may and June. So that’s certainly happened where initially we thought we may have to pursue deferment agreements with some of these tenants. And they came back because the business has opened earlier than they expected and/or they felt better about the liquidity situation and decided to make us home. With respect to the first part of your question, Spenser around, did we have to alter the leases, the vast majority of what we have entered into, which is that $14 million worth of rent of the total $16 million that we entered into an agreement has been done without having to make amendments to the lease itself to the original lease term. And so that is the main reason why, we are being able to stay within the accounting rules to view these as different rents. So we haven’t had to sort of request a longer duration or a payback, et cetera. We expect to be paid back during the original lease term, and therefore we didn’t have to enter into any of lease modification. And that is a similar story on the remaining $46 million that we have entered into discussions with. Now around the edges, there have been some tenants where they requested a longer payback period, which went beyond the original lease term. And those have obviously been – they are not part of the deferred rent agreements, which didn’t result in a lease amendment. And so – but that’s a very, very small percentage. The vast majority has been with – without having to make amendments to the lease itself.
Spenser Allaway: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: Thanks. Sumit, if I heard you right, it sounds like you walked away from a portfolio transaction in the quarter. Just if I heard that right, just getting a sense of maybe what the cap rate was on that to see how low is too low for you guys? And maybe what the investment spread, just wasn’t there.
Sumit Roy: Yes. Todd. Actually, there were a couple of transactions there in the $650 million that I talked about. Both were international and they were both products that we would have absolutely love to have owned. I don’t want to speak to the specific cap rates because these are fairly large transactions. And if you do some amount of research, you’ll be able to figure them out. And one’s not public yet. So – but what I will say is if you look at, I’ll answer your question slightly differently, Todd, if you look at the spreads we are making, we made about $135 million – 135 basis points of spreads, which was 15 basis points inside of our average spread that we’ve made in the history of our acquisitions. And so the point I want to make is, yes, we are willing to make smaller spread, but not to a point, which does not justify day one having enough of a positive uplift from these investments and take into account some of the risks that are inherent in these investments, though, if you look at the industry, you look at the operator, these are the types of businesses and operators that you feel a very high level of confidence that not only will they make it through the initial lease term, but will continue to operate these businesses post their initial lease term, and these lease terms tend to be 15 years to 20 years. So – but we have – we’ve done up to 131 of basis point spread. So we are certainly willing to go south of what our average spread has been, but there is a point beyond which we won’t go.
Todd Stender: Got it, okay. Thank you. And I’m not sure if I missed this, but just looking at the – when we look at the same-store revenue growth, quick service restaurants is what created the biggest hit. I wouldn’t have guessed that, but maybe casual dining to that degree, but maybe just flesh out what happened there within QSR?
Sumit Roy: Sure. So there are a couple of operators that constituted the biggest chunk of that write-off. One’s NPC that filed BK. And another one is continuing to pay rent, but it’s just one that we feel we don’t have the same level of confidence. And this is a name that has been on our watch list for over a year now. And in fact, they did end up paying July rent. But nevertheless, we feel like our level of confidence doesn’t quite meet that 75% collectibility threshold, and so we decided to write those off. And so that’s – those are the two names that constitute the QSR piece of the write-off.
Todd Stender: Okay, thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.
John Massocca: Yes. So apologies if I missed this in the prepared remarks, but as you look into July, how much of the uncollected rent was deferred and how much was kind of not subject to an agreement? And are there any industries that are driving this portion and was it deferred?
Sumit Roy: Yes. We did not share with you, John, what the results are for July in terms of our negotiation. What I have shared with you is of the 86.5% that we collected for the second quarter, i.e. the 13.5% that remained uncollected, 9% of that is basically that $46.2 million that we’ve shared with you in terms of rent that we are in the midst of negotiating. There isn’t an agreement in place. $14.1 million or approximately 3% are our negotiations that have completed or are very close to being penciled. And then the remaining 1.3% of that 13.5% uncollected was written off. So that’s the – those are the three buckets of that 13.5% that we didn’t collect for the second quarter. We haven’t shared for the month of July, the 8.5% of uncollected, what’s the breakup there. But those numbers, obviously, the – what was being negotiated, that number has reduced because some of those negotiations have gotten over the finish line. But we will bring those – we will share that information at a later date.
John Massocca: Okay. And then I guess this question could go towards your overall portfolio, maybe even specifically with regards to health and fitness. Have you seen any operators do that and concerned about increased commercial restrictions that came into place as you kind of saw regional pandemic spikes in July? And I guess, do you have any kind of initial take on how that may or may not impact August rent collection?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Look, thankfully, all of this was playing out in the month of July. How people felt at the beginning of July was very different from the end of July when the contraction rates have started to go up and were very concentrated in the small states, in Texas, in Florida, in Arizona, California. And clearly, there was, if not a slowing down, there was even potentially an unwinding of the openings. But outside of California where health and fitness were asked to reclose, Florida, Texas, they continue to basically just have the restrictive – the restrictions in place in terms of the number of potential members who could be visiting the clubs, et cetera, to stay in place. And where they unwinded were on the – more on the bars and beaches and things like that. And while all of this was playing out, we were in negotiations with one of our two largest health and fitness clients and we are close to an agreement with one of them. And the other largest operator has continued to pay rent throughout the pandemic to us. So look, does that mean that they may not come back to us and talk to us if the slowdown occurs or if there is an unwinding of some of the openings? Yes, that’s a possibility. But it was happening real time. And at least as of today, we have not heard back from this particular operator. So – and by the way, they ended up paying July rent. So that’s part of the reason why our collections in July has been as high as it has of 91.5%.
John Massocca: And just a quick point of clarification, the tenant that you’re negotiating with pay the July rent, not the ones who have paid rent through the entire period of 2Q and July?
Sumit Roy: Right. So we – of the two largest operators that part of our top 20. One has paid us rent all through. And the other one ended up paying July rent.
John Massocca: Okay, very helpful. That’s it for me. Thank you very much.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: And our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey there, most of mine have been asked, but I wanted to get some clarification on something you mentioned earlier. You mentioned that some tenants paid partial rents. Can you talk about some of the tenants or maybe the industry that you’ve moved to partial rents beyond, say, the movies? And do you also have tenants you’ve moved to percentage rents and/or have abated rent for you yet? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Sure, Haendel. Look, I think most of the negotiations on the deferred part of the equation was around us independently verifying the liquidity situation for some of these tenants and whether or not they were open, what was their balance sheet strength and their ability to pay and that is sort of how – and in speaking with them, we have concluded as to whether there needs to be some sort of a deferment or not. And then what shape is that deferment going to take? Should we have then pay partial rent for the next few months? Should we have them pay 100% of the rent for the next few months, but make us hold on the previous three months where we may not have collected any rent? All of that has been on a case-by-case basis, Haendel. And so with the – if you think about our portfolio and you look at the industries that have been most impacted by this COVID-19 induced pandemic, it’s the ones we’ve been talking about. It’s the theater business, it’s the health and fitness business, it’s daycare to some extent and the restaurant business. And they all have a different profile attached to them. If you look at the theaters, we have almost 100% of our theaters close today with the expectation that they will start opening up in August 20 for EMC and August 21 for Regal. But that, again, is subject to change if things don’t improve. If you look at the day care business, most of the day care business has either been – has been partially open. Because they still continue to have restrictions in terms of the number of what percentage of occupancy they can hit. Then you look at the health and fitness business, a lot of the health and fitness business is open, either fully open or partially open. But even these occupancy numbers of – you can’t have more than 30% occupancy does not impact the health and fitness business as much as it impacts some of these other businesses because they tend to run at 30% occupancy anyway. So when you take all of that into account, then you create a profile of who can pay what rent. And that leads to the types of agreements that we’ve entered into, which translates to that 91.5% collection for the month of July. And so the remaining piece that hasn’t been collected, what shape is that going to take? Are some of them going to start paying partial rent in the coming months? That is the expectation. But I remain cautious because it is all subject to what we see happening with the contraction rates and the mortality rates. And as long as they are stable to contain, I think we are going to be okay. But if it continues to get worse, and there is a chance that we may see some of these shutdowns reoccur and some of these discussions revisited.
Haendel St. Juste: Certainly, certainly. Appreciate that. And I have one more. I’m not sure if I missed it earlier, I’ve been in and off this call with power outages here, but did you talk about your inclination to invest oversea here and Europe. You talked about Canada in the past. Last year, that was, I believe, nearly half of your investment volumes. So curious on what your appetite here is how you perceive that risk? Or perhaps could we see the bulk of your investments be more domestic? Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Yes. Haendel, the vast majority of our investments, even last year, was here in the U.S. We had about $800 million of the $3.7 billion that we did, was in the UK market. This year, the mix is 1/3, 2/3. So 2/3 of it has been here in the U.S. and 1/3 has been in the UK, and we expect that mix to play out over the remainder. But when we first entered into the UK markets, what we had shared with the market at that time was that 25% of our acquisitions we thought was going to be in the UK and 75% was going to continue to be here in the U.S. And that has shifted slightly to 1/3, 2/3. And I expect it’s going to be in between those two numbers for the remainder of the year.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from Anthony Paolone with J.P. Morgan.
Anthony Paolone: Thank you. So you have 12% of your revenue that you’re either negotiating or you’re done with the deferral agreement. So just trying to understand if everything plays out the way these are being drafted or have been written, what is – what do collections look like come, say, 1Q or 2Q 2021? Is it 92%? Is it 98%? Just trying to understand the cadence of this returning to par, so to speak.
Sumit Roy: Look, the first metric I’m focused on, Anthony, is to see, can we start collecting 100% of what’s owed to us. And the good news here is that at least we are trending in that direction with every month that has gone by. And the second element of the good news that I’ve seen is, not only are we trending upwards in terms of what is owed for a given month, but some of these tenants have gone back and paid us on rents that they didn’t pay in the months of April, May and June. And so that continues to give us confidence that, at least they are feeling confident enough to pay us back rents that we hadn’t even agreed to in terms of a deferment agreement. But I want to put all of that in context here. Look, if the COVID-19 situation continues to deteriorate, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that some of these guys would come back and talk to us and say, "Hey, sorry, we have to pause again because all of our stores have been shut down again." But as long as that doesn’t happen or that doesn’t happen in scale, then I think these trends are going to continue. And the first thing I’m going to be trying to look for is when are we reaching that 100% of the old rents for a given month, when are we getting that 100% collection? And as soon as we get that, then we start to focus on, okay, all the deferred amounts and the agreements that we have put in place, are they starting to pay back portions of it? Because if you look at the vast majority of the agreements that are already in place, most of the payback is 4.5 months, 4.7 months. Sorry, 4.5 months of deferred rent and the payback is within a 12-month period. So portions of it need to start getting paid back over the next few months. And so if we start to see them paying their monthly rent plus some of the deferred rent, that’s when I know we are back to normal. And the rest of it is all noise as far as I can see. I mean, look, it’s important to see what is happening in each state and all of that, but ultimately, it needs to translate to our operators being able to run their businesses and feel confident enough to make the call.
Anthony Paolone: Okay, thank you. And then second question is on 7-Eleven, I think second largest tenant. Just given what they announced earlier in the week, can you just comment on your appetite for having substantially more exposure to, say, one tenant and balancing that against perhaps being like a very good credit, which has served you well right now.
Sumit Roy: Yes. So Anthony, look, we like the convenience store business. It is the industry that we have – to be 12% of our overall portfolio is convenience stores right now. And within that, we are very grateful to have a very good relationship with 7-Eleven. And the fact that they were able to buy another tenant of ours, which is Speedway, is a good thing in my mind. They’re consolidating the industry. I was going through their investor presentation yesterday, and it’s got some very interesting statistics, some of which continues to reconfirm what a good operator they are and some of the synergies that they can create. Having said that, we want to be mindful of being able to run a very prudent portfolio. And – but not every tenant and not every industry is created equal. If there is an industry and there is a particular operator that we would make exceptions for, it is absolutely 7-Eleven and it is absolutely the convenience store business. But we can’t let convenience store dominate 40% of our portfolio and nor can we let a single-tenant dominate a big chunk of our register on a permanent basis. But are we willing to help support some of our clients with whom we’ve had an amazing relationship and we believe in the industry and we believe in a particular tenant? The answer is yes. So this is like one of our – my colleagues told us. This is the [risk on detail] for Realty Income to be able to go out and do these very large-scale transactions and be able to help our clients and at the same time, create a portfolio that continues to become incredibly strong. And so these are the opportunities that we were hoping to have discussions around them. Yes, if it presents itself and I don’t know if it’s going to be all $5 billion sale-leaseback that they have identified. But if it’s portions of it, we’d be happy to engage in that.
Anthony Paolone: Great. Thank you for the color.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.
Linda Tsai: Thank you for taking my questions. I just had one. Understanding is a function of acquisition mix and capital costs. How do you see the 131 basis points investment spread you generated this quarter? And how does that trend in the forthcoming quarters?
Sumit Roy: Linda, you were breaking up, and I don’t know if it’s just me, but I think your question was around the spreads that we achieved in the second quarter and how do we see it going forward? Is that right?
Linda Tsai: Yes, that’s right.
Sumit Roy: Okay. Yes. So look, the – our cost of capital in the second quarter was obviously impacted by what happened to the cost of equity during the three months, where we were in the midst of the COVID-19 situation. And the fact that our stated spread was 131 basis points. It’s largely being driven by 2/3 of the equity piece, being priced reflective of where we were trading in these three months. And the question of if our cost of equity is where it is today or continues to improve from where it is today, those spreads should improve. Because the product that we are seeing is very much along the lines of what we have done in the first half. There’s just a lot more of it. And so our expectation is that our spreads will improve. Our expectation is that our overall cost of capital will improve. But the fact that we have optionality to not lean on one particular source of capital versus the other, I think just gives us more optionality in terms of how do we permanently finance our transaction? And then what ultimately turns out to be the permanent spread that we are able to trap? I think that is left to be seen, but the expectation is that it should continue to improve going forward.
Linda Tsai: Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: And this concludes the Q&A portion of Realty’s Income conference call. I would now like to turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today, and we’ll keep everyone updated on the business going forward. Thank you, Keisha, for orchestrating this call. We really appreciate it.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-20 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. Welcome to the VEREIT First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Bonni Rosen, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Bonni Rosen: Thank you for joining us today for the VEREIT 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Glenn Rufrano, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul McDowell, our Chief Operating Officer; Mike Bartolotta, our Chief Financial Officer and Tom Roberts, our Chief Investment Officer. Today's call is being webcast on our website at vereit.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at approximately 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time today. Dial-in for the replay is 1-877-344-7529 with the confirmation code of 10143075. Before I turn the call over to Glenn, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements in this earnings call, which are not historical facts, will be forward looking. VERIET's actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statement and factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC filings, including the quarterly report filed today. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports, VERIET disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statement except as expressly required by law. Let me quickly review the format of today's call. First, Glenn will begin by providing a brief business summary, followed by Paul who will give an operational update with Mike then presenting our financial and balance sheet. Glenn will then wrap up with closing remarks. We will conclude today's call by opening the line for questions, where we will be joined by our Chief Investment Officer, Tom Roberts. Glenn, let me turn the call over to you.
Glenn Rufrano: Thanks Bonni. And thanks for joining us today. The world has changed and while we know that normal first quarter results will not be at the forefront of this call, there are a few quick highlights. AFFO per diluted share for the quarter was $0.17. Year-to-date acquisitions totaled $146 million. In addition, the office partnership acquired a $33 million property of which the company cash contribution was $2.7 million. Dispositions totaled $188 million including the Company’s share of dispositions contributed to the office partnership of $70.2 million. As the impact of Covid-19 grew in March, we paused balance sheet acquisitions to better understand the current environment. Net debt to normalize EBITDA was unchanged from last quarter at 5.7x. What have we been thinking about since the quarter end? We are certainly happy that our team together since 2015 executed a number of strategies and transactions as a prerequisite to begin growth in 2020. We believed it was prudent to sell the nontraded REIT business, Cole Capital, greatly reduced the concentration in our largest tenant and generally diversify the portfolio. Settle all outstanding litigation and obtain an investment grade rating balance sheet. Our business model diversifies our capital sources to include institutional partnerships, picking assets which pose no conflict. However, here we are in a disrupted economy. And we now have four overriding goals. Keep our employees safe and provide a work environment and tools to be productive. Recognize the extent of challenges and interact in a collaborative fashion. Maintain the progress we work so hard for especially the resulting investment grade balance sheets and use the business model we built to grow AFFO when the market stabilizes. We understand there are a number of portfolio factors you are interested in and I will let our Chief Operating Officer, Paul McDowell, who has been working closely with our tenants, bring you up to date. Paul?
Paul McDowell: Thanks Glenn. As already mentioned, we know the focal point for this call is how the portfolio is performing during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our teams are still very focused on normal asset management which is also very important. Leasing for the quarter was very strong with over 2 million square feet leased of which 1.4 million square feet were early renewals. Total activity included 1.3 million square feet of industrial, 498,000 square feet of office; a 190,000 square feet of retail and 73,000 square feet of restaurants. For renewal leases, we recaptured approximately 94% of prior rents on an initial cash basis. And many of these newly extended leases have additional built in rent increases. Importantly, we were able to finalize leases we had in process prior to the pandemic disruption along with some dispositions and some of that activity has carried further into Q2. Occupancy ended the quarter at a healthy 99.1%. Now let's talk more specifically about our portfolio performance and where we are today. Our April rent receipt came in at 81% and so far rent for May is at 78% which includes 2% to be paid from a government agency tenant that pays in arrears. The underpinnings of these relatively strong collection results were driven by our property type diversification, industry breakdown, investment grade tenancy; public versus private ownership and geographic diversity. Our allocation to office, industrial and necessity based retail including our top industry exposures such as discount, pharmacy, grocery warehouse clubs and convenience has helped in our rental collection. Overall, 17 of our Top 20 tenants effectively paid full rent in April. In May so far 16 of our Top 20 tenants have paid rent.  Or approximately 37% of investment-grade tenancy for the total portfolio and 46% within retail were a strong component of April rent collections at almost a 100%. And well over 95% so far in May. Over 60% of our tenants are public in the overall portfolio and over 68% are public within the retail portfolio which we view very positively. Fortunately, we have a lot of geographic diversity with many of our properties spread out in areas of the country that have had less impact from the virus and many are in states that have started to reopen for business. Although, they remain a patchwork of restrictions based on regions of the country open now or opening soon in some capacity, we have 3,393 properties or 88% in these open locations. Only about 9.6% of our portfolio is in the hard-hit northeast with 2.3% and 3.1% in the hardest-hit states of New York and New Jersey respectively. The largest real estate teams in our company have always been our strong and our very experienced asset management and property management departments, which have served us well. These teams have been augmented in the past two months with personnel from underwriting and acquisitions. Collectively, they have been doing an outstanding job in trying circumstances and our collections to date are partially reflective of those efforts. And I will take this opportunity to thank them. Our dedicated property type asset management teams have been in discussion with our tenants to understand the impact of Covid-19 on their businesses. Rent relief requests have been received from tenants representing approximately 34% of rental income on an annualized basis. We have been evaluating each request on a case-by-case basis based on each tenant's unique financial and operating situation, analyzing metrics such as industry segments, geographic locations where they are operating; corporate financial health, rent coverage and the tenants' liquidity. Our goal has been to help those tenants we think need and deserve it in the short run, while at the same time pressing for payment from those tenants who we judge do not merit rent relief, have access to other forms of capital or being opportunistic. Of the received requests to date, a little over a third have been approved, about a third are in negotiations and about a third have either been denied or we have taken no action. The deferral agreements we have made generally have been in a two to four month range and pay back within 12-months with interest as appropriate. While we have generally structured any rent relief as deferral not abatement, in a small number of cases we have created rent per term for tenants we think will be here in the long term and where we think we've created value in a longer lease. It is worth noting again that the vast majority of our ARI comes from large public and private companies that have the financial resources and access to capital necessary to weather this storm. We do, however, have some smaller tenants and so we've also been monitoring the various government assistance programs, which we think can be helpful to some of our most impacted industries such as franchise restaurants and entertainment related retail. About half of the tenants with in the restaurant portfolio have applied to the Paycheck Protection Program and we expect some amount will have access to these funds. We also have been monitoring the new governmental initiatives such as the Main Street Lending Program which may help some of our larger tenants. Finally, as I noted above rent collections so far for May are 78% which is about 1% ahead of where we were during the same time period in April. As others have pointed out, many tenants went into April with some momentum from the first quarter with May be in the month where the full impact of the shutdown has been felt. With that in mind, we are very gratified with our collection levels so far for May. Our current expectation is that total collections for May will be approximately where April ended. Industrial is so far coming in a bit lower than April primarily to one tenant which paid in April and we believe can continue to pay. We are currently in discussions with that tenant. At this point, we think June collections will be in the range of collections for April and May. Further portfolio segment information and details can be found in our Investor presentation file today. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike?
Mike Bartolotta: Thanks Paul and thank you all for joining us today. Our first quarter numbers really were on target. However, we recognize that going forward for some time it's a different environment and what's most important is our balance sheet and liquidity. Before I get into that though let me quickly discuss how we prepared as a company to ensure the smoothest transition to our virtual environment. We're currently operating essentially 100% remotely. Anticipating that an office shutdown was probable, our IT team quickly mobilized our business continuity plans and made sure we had equipment for all employees who are able to work effectively from home. Employees are utilizing virtual private networks in their homes to maintain a high level of security and we prepared training and awareness materials for employees to help them get set up and they continue to have access to a 24x7 IT support desk. In addition, the management committee participates in daily virtual meetings to make sure the business is operating efficiently. I've been impressed with how well everyone has been able to adapt during this difficult period and I'd like to thank our entire team for all of their efforts in keeping the business running as normal as possible. Turning to our balance sheet now. The company remains well positions with net debt to normalize EBITDA unchanged from year-end at 5.7x. A key focal point for us as a company has been maintaining a strong and liquid balance sheet and we worked very hard over the last few years to gain back our investment grade rating. As Covid-19 pandemic continued to unfold, we initiated an additional draw in excess of normal operating requirements of $600 million on our revolving line of credit to enhance our cash position. As of May 15, VEREIT had corporate liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion comprised of $601 million in cash and cash equivalents and $588 million of availability under our credit facility. Our fixed charge coverage ratio remained healthy increasing to 3.3x and our net debt to gross real estate investment ratio was 39%. Our unencumbered asset ratio increased to 81%; the weighted average duration of our debt was 4.4 years and we are 86% fixed, which reflects the higher utilization of our line of credit this quarter. Additionally, we a very manageable amount of debt coming due in the near term. As of quarter end, we had $90 million in mortgage notes payable due this year at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5%. And we had a $322 million convertible bond due at the end of December. In 2021, we have $299 million in mortgage notes payable due throughout next year but no other corporate bonds coming due until 2024j. Based on what I see now, we see no issues with our covenants. Moving to our outlook. We withdrew guidance in April and are not providing an update at this time due to the uncertain market we all face; the Board of Directors is reducing the second quarter dividend from $0.1375 to $0.077 representing a decrease of 44%. The reduction was determined after extensive financial analysis. This allows us to prudently manage our debt levels and the balance sheet stability we work so hard for over the last five years. Board of Directors has not made any decisions with respect to its dividend policy beyond the second quarter and we'll continue to monitor the current environment and its impact on our tenants and business. Based on our estimate of taxable net income today, we see no issues with this reduction and satisfy our REIT requirements. And with that I will turn the call back to Glenn.
Glenn Rufrano: Thanks Mike. Our defined corporate commitment is to always serve to the best of our ability, three main constituencies. Our stakeholders, tenants and employees. Our combined efforts continue to focus on all three. We transitioned our employees to a fully virtual work from home environment in the middle of March quickly new processes and business intelligence tracking tools were developed to assist and monitoring our tenants and potential risks that can come our way. We have a deeply experienced team here at the company not only on the executive management side, but within all of our real estate groups. As leasing and asset management becomes even more important during this time, we have transitioned some of our acquisition personnel as well as others to assist with navigating the challenges our tenants will be facing. Our legal staff, attorneys and paralegals are working to support our efforts. I also said on daily calls where we strive to come up with the best tenant solutions. Every request goes through a process and ends with a sign-off from our investment committee consisting of myself, Paul, Tom and Mike. Our dedicated employee teams have collectively exhibited great energy and resolve and we thank them. Mike presented our current balance sheet statistics. Of note we maintain net debt to EBITDA 5.7x. Our cash and revolving liquidity remains sufficient and our assets are highly liquid with 81% unencumbered. But the exception of our converts later this year. We have no corporate bonds due until 2024. The Board's decision to reduce the dividend for this quarter is not based generally upon a micro review of our business, but more importantly on a macro view when uncertain economy. The difficulty in predicting the duration of this economic disturbance is glaring. Possibilities are extraordinarily wide. When you know where you are, you can better judge what to do and how to do it. While we are getting a better view of tenant receipts with April and May, duration can have a variety of outcomes.  Our view is that with such uncertainties strong balance sheet maintains stakeholder value. The sizing of the dividend was based upon a series of financial analyses, dissecting a range of possible outcomes throughout this year and next. We chose this base amount on which to build the dividend while protecting against any increase in debt. As more information is available in each of the next two quarters, this decision will be under constant review. As you heard in Paul's presentation, our portfolio diversification is serving us well not only by property type, but also investment grade parentage, credit, industry and geographic limits, as well as a high percentage of public companies. We will of course reevaluate the portfolio parameters as we move throughout this year. While we are in a very difficult environment, our business model provides the ability to grow and thrive once we get past this. Although disappointed that 2020 will be a transition year, our experience in transforming the company over the last five years will provide strength to get us through this. Our expectations for the future is that our liquid balance sheet, diversified portfolio, experienced team and partnerships will all perform and reignite hopefully in 2021. Before ending, I would like to applaud those in the healthcare profession and all first responders who have made such a difference in our lives, certainly mine. I also want to take this time to thank everyone for their kind notes during my recovery from the virus. They were great pick me ups, and very much appreciate it. I'll now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Haendel Juste from Mizuho. Go ahead.
HaendelJuste: Hey, good afternoon. And Glenn, good to hear your voice again. Glad that budget back and well again. So first question is more high level to think about the portfolio and curious on how Covid and life in the aftermath of Covid might be impacting your view on your portfolio allocation and subcategory exposures going forward. Clearly having a bit more office and industrial has been beneficial. So I'm curious how the thinking yours, the board might be evolving here on portfolio balance effect or allocation post Covid? Thank you.
GlennRufrano: Sure. Thank Haendel. And thanks for your kind note. As you know, we -- as you followed us, Haendel, and others we've been pretty disciplined since 2018. The portfolio at that time we generally not understood and so we try to make sure the market understood what we were thinking in the future. We put metrics around a number of elements here, percentages of property type, tenant credit, investment grade rating, geography and a number of others, all to provide diversification. So we have always thought that understanding the portfolio long term is the right thing to do. And we will continue due to that in future. So that's before. Now let's if I took us to just January first and we thought about where our portfolio should be, we'd be saying certain things like experiential real estates a good idea because it's a bridge against e-commerce and restaurants and entertainment is pretty good. We also had a number of conversations on these calls about pharmacies. Well, would pharmacies be best or not be best in the portfolio, that's turned around today. We have all turned around today based upon this pandemic in terms of what property types may or may not perform over periods of time. The one thing that I say for us now thinking about the portfolio is that we're not going to make decisions based upon what's happened today. We're in the middle of the storm. We're going to wait for some of this storm to subside before we make decisions on where the metrics will be and how we will reshape the portfolio. I believe there will be some reshaping but how we will shape is very hard for us to judge right now. To your point some property types like office are now performing well. Our industrial performance is very good and the only thing -- the only constant denominator that I can take out of what's happened over the last five to six years is that diversification is a plus, will always be diversified but we may change some of our metrics in the future. We're just not ready to do that yet, Haendel.
HaendelJuste: Got it. And thank you for the perspective, appreciated. And then a bit more on the dividend, appreciate your comments earlier but I was hoping if you could give us a bit more perspective on the process to cut the second quarter specifically at 44%. Some reason other sectors have opted to cut the dividend or suspend until the end of the year and make a final determination; others have credit immediately, so I'm curious on why 44% to second quarter versus these other options and perhaps are we trying to read too much into it to suggest or to think that this suggests an estimated recovery of maybe 90-ish percent of your cash flows, prior cash flow pre Covid. So any other context around your thinking here and what maybe we should be reading into it. Thank you.
GlennRufrano: No, good, another good question. Certainly that was a difference this quarter. The first, I'd say it's not easy -- it's not an easy decision to reduce a dividend, it's just not. Make your feet burn and your stomachs turn when you have to make a decision like that but we as a company and the board thought it was necessary to make that decision. The decision itself as I mentioned wasn't only based upon the macro review what's happening today, it's more importantly it was really based upon the uncertainty of what's happening in the economy. It's a very difficult to predict duration here and we have -- will all have a hard time on duration and that will play a very important role in what and how our tenants will run their businesses. But what we decided was that we would take a look at various outcomes of what can happen over the next year or two. We have a basis in April and May which is helpful that it was better than the sort of April. I'm not sure we knew what was going to happen. We have a better feel for April and May and you've heard Paul talk about June and if we looked at the uncertainties in the future, the common denominator we saw was that we needed to maintain a strong balance sheet. But at the same time since we had, I'd say substantial cash flow over the last couple of months not a 100% which is what we wanted, but cash flow we thought it was fair to pay some of that cash flow to the shareholder. The question now was the balance of the two. The balance of the two comes with the sizing of the dividend, which is really a question. And we did that by starting and reviewing a series of financial analyses. We really did dissect possible outcomes through this year and next. And our guiding light was can we come up with a base amount of a dividend build on but at the same time protect against any increase in debt. And those were the two relationships that we work towards. And if you, if I were to try to describe our analyses, I would try to describe them in terms of a V, a U and a W. The V being a quick recovery; U being a slower recovery and perhaps the beginning of the U higher than the end of U and a W where clearly the middle of the W is not going to be equal to the left-hand side of it. I was just reading an article and it's almost the discussion between Minuchin and Powell. Minuchin would say it's a V; Powell would say it's a U or W. We seriously looked at all three of those which is really used on duration and based upon those views, we thought dividend which was $0.077 this quarter represented a sustainable dividend to build on. Now we're not -- we just provided second quarter dividend. We're not approving the third or fourth quarter dividend by any means and clearly if there's any real big disturbance in the economy, we're not sure that base but right now we think that's a very solid base on which to build a dividend. And that build will occur when we think it's appropriate relative to what we're seeing in the environment on a day to day basis.
Operator: Our next question is from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Go ahead.
SheilaMcGrath: Yes. Good afternoon. Welcome back, Glenn. Can you give us give us some perspective on credit loss typically for your portfolio maybe historically over time? And how you view the credit loss for the portfolio in the near term? And just following on that do you expect to be converting some leases to cash accounting in the near term?
GlennRufrano: Good. I think that those are two very good questions, Sheila and I'm going to pass the first one on credit to Paul and then Paul I would ask you to pass on in terms of accounting to Mike. So Paul, you take that first one.
PaulMcDowell: Sure. Of course. Hi, Sheila. With respect to credit losses in the portfolio we've been pretty fortunate and that we've had very low credit losses over the past few years. So we haven't had much in the way of credit losses. We have had the few small bankruptcies as you know from time to time and we generally, we've lost that credit but we've also been able to relet the properties and regain cash flows. From a going-forward perspective here, we don't know exactly where this all ends up and as Glenn mentioned in his remarks the key here duration. We went into this pandemic with a credit watch list that generally runs between 2% and 2% of adjusted rents and now suddenly we have a lot of credits in our portfolio that are very healthy companies that are through no fault of their own suddenly under a significant amount of credit stress. And the question is how long does that stress last. We're fortunate in that most of the portfolio is made up of public companies and they've got access to capital. So we're pretty confident that most of our tenants will be able to jump the ditch here and resume being the healthy companies they were before. But it's a little too early to give you a sense at this moment about where we expect credit losses to come to rest since we don't yet know the duration. And I think with that I'll give Mike the accounting question.
MikeBartolotta: Hi, Sheila. It's Mike. I think the accounting question is really going to come down to the fact that typically before we have the pandemic if we had some deferrals or some changes to any of our leases, we would have treated it as a lease modification under 842, but the FASB came out with what they're calling an expediency because they understood that everyone is going to or many people were going to be dealing with deferral situations and what the new FASB says is the expediency says if you have a situation where you have no real substantial change in the original contracts cash flow, but rather just typically you have a two, three, four months deferral and then you collect that rent, let's say over the next six months or a year so that can be handled under this new expediency and the expediency has a couple of decision points. One is it reasonable that you're going to be able to make that collection during that period. If the answer is yes, you can then simply treat the revenue as you normally would and establish a receivable during those deferral periods and you would record the revenue during the deferral periods as regular revenue, you set up a receivable and your AFFO, your NOI and your normalized EBITDA would all reflect it as if it were included in those amounts which is different than if there was a lease amendment. They do give you the option of something called variable accounting which is very similar to cash accounting. I'm not quite sure why one would want to use that given this other treatment, but you do have to first make a decision about collectability if you think there's some doubt about collectability then you account for it on a cash basis. And then the last option is if you're actually changing the terms of the lease and that could be typically a blend and extended for some reason, someone is getting a month or two of free rent and extreme say for three to five year extension on the lease, you do have to go back and do the normal 842 lease modification accounting. So that decision tree is something we'll be going through every completed transaction and deciding which bucket it belongs in and how we account for it.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeremy Metz from BMO. Go ahead.
JeremyMetz: Hey, guys. Paul, I was hoping you could -- two parts. Just one could you give us an update on the latest with Art Van and your boxes there? And then going back to the rent relief request, I guess I'm just curious how you balance the fine line between granting deferrals and not granting. I mean arguably just because someone could pay many retailers see others getting deferral, so how do you balance keeping those tenants healthy, happy and in place so giving others breathing room particularly on the retail and restaurants.
PaulMcDowell: You just want me to go straight into this, Glenn?
GlennRufrano: Yes. Go. Paul, yes, I thought Jeremy -- thanks Jeremy for -- he directed it and I should have redirected it to make sure Paul gets it, I don't answer it because Paul, he'll answer that question better than I will.
PaulMcDowell: Sure. With respect to Art Van, as you may remember we have eight stores, Art Van declared bankruptcy pre Covid and their bankruptcy had nothing to do with Covid. But subsequently they have decided to liquidate. We have got all those stores on the market and we have an LOI in place at the moment with a very experienced operator for four of the eight and had about 70% of the previous rents and the remaining four are on the market. With respect to the delicate balance between how do we manage deferral request from tenants, I touched on it in the script and I think you're accurate in calling it a delicate balance because there's a lot of things at play. We have what is the size of our balance sheet and liquidity and on the one hand what is the size of the tenants' balance sheet and their liquidity on the other. What are their likelihood of getting capital from other sources and we also have tenant relationships to think about how often do we interact with that tenant, how often -- when do we have renewals coming up and so on and so forth. All of those factors come into play. So and I say we've had deferral request across the range. We've had some sort of deferral requests that have been launched from tenants who clearly have got the ability to pay and are just asking for deferrals because everyone else seems to be asking for deferrals. And those we generally just simply deny and then we have other tenants where they're clearly in significant distress. And we have to make a judgment about whether or not we are in a position to really help them. And if we can help them for how much and for how long. And so we make those judgments every day. We have a committee that meets several times a week. I meet with our asset managers virtually every day to talk about each and every one of these. And we go through a committee process and once we make a judgement it goes up and then Mike, Glenn and I make a judgement about what to do.
JeremyMetz: I appreciate the color. And if I could just go back and ask one follow-up on the Art Van based on your comments that four are going with the very experienced operator. It sounds like this is a different operator than the one we heard a couple of your net lease peers shuck a deal, is that correct? 
PaulMcDowell: That's correct.
JeremyMetz: All right. And then, Tom, I was just wondering on the deal front, it seems like there are still assets that are out there. You saw some 10.31 money sloshing around that we're hearing about. We're about two months into this, so I just wanted it if any color on what's happening on the ground? Are you seeing deals go under contract and what's the sort of early read on pricing? How much our yields resetting at this point? If there is activity, that's still happening.
GlennRufrano: You got it, Tom.
TomRoberts: Sure. So as Glenn mentioned we're on pause as well as most of our peers, so not a lot of activity in the market right now particularly in the retail sector. I just think that's too early to pick up -- pick an impact on the market. Although you did mention there is 10.31 exchange activities in the market which we've been active selling some assets to those type buyers. But despite, by far the strongest product type is industrial which is what we buy in our partnership with our Korean partner. There we've seen some pause in the market but probably just maybe 10%, 20% impact on pricing. Seller expectations have moderated slightly but we think there's going to be activity in that market as well. Office would be the same for single tenant long-term investment grade credits. I think the market is held up pretty well probably in that same price range. And we hope to be active in both those front end partnerships in the second half of the year. We do have a partnership transaction that we announced in our last call. A very large industrial project about 2.3 million square feet at $247 million transaction that we anticipate will close here mid-year. We also have two other builder suits that were under contract with that would close in that third or fourth quarter. So we remain active. They have been impacted by Covid but certainly we hope that both partnerships will be active in the second half of the year. So I think generally too soon too early to tell, but we, I think generally in our space and the industrial and office side and even the investment grade or higher quality retail will have very little impact on pricing, very small.
JeremyMetz: And so no VEREIT price --sorry, Glenn. Go ahead.
GlennRufrano: No. I just wanted to make sure, Jeremy, what Tom said I think I misunderstood. Tom you had mentioned 10 to 25 in cap rates and not percent decline.
TomRoberts: Yes. Very small percent.
GlennRufrano: I misunderstood, sorry I just misunderstood. 
TomRoberts: 10 or 20 basis point which is far less than 5% impact on pricing and a lot of it just has to do with deal that's in place at the time. How badly does the seller want to sell? But I think generally this type product type is very stable long-term credit leases no matter what the product type is, has held up pretty well I think at this point.
Operator: Our next question is from Anthony Paolone from J.P. Morgan. Go ahead.
AnthonyPaolone: Okay. Thanks and glad you are well, Glenn. Question for Paul. You mentioned your view that June should look pretty close to April and May. I was wondering if you could just talk with a little more detail in terms of as you look inside the portfolio and what's happening at the asset level, where things look like they might be improving versus areas of the portfolio where it could be worse if things linger for a few more months like this.
PaulMcDowell: Sure. Yes. So we're -- we've been building up our point of view about where tenants are coming out. We're very lucky in that most of our portfolio is very steady right. It's necessity based retail. It's office and industrial so most of our cash flows we feel very, very comfortable about. We will continue no matter kind of no matter what then it's really at the margin here where we're looking which tenants have paid, which tenants haven't paid. We're in negotiations with pretty much every single tenant who's asked for a deferral request. So we are talking to them and by talking to them, the asset management teams are able to make a judgment about where they see payment streams coming in the coming months. So we've got April and May under our belts now. We predicted where we thought those would come out. They come out close to where we predicted they would. And so we feel we have pretty decent insight into June, June so far. With respect to areas where we see improvement I think when we look operationally, the most market improvement is in the one that we would like to see improve the most that is in the restaurant portfolio. Initially many of our restaurant tenants were hit very significantly by the pandemic slowdown. And now many of them particularly in the QSR portfolio, sales are only down 10% to 20% which while still very, very significant they can operate profitably at those levels. We've also seen improvement in casual dining. A lot of our tenants didn't really have large to go infrastructures in place or we're just developing them when the pandemic hit. They have hit obviously the fast-forward button on those and it varies across the different brands, but they are improving their to-go performance and so their sales while down initially sort of in the 80% range are now down sort of in the 50% range. So we are seeing some significant cash flow improvements in the casual dining in a casual dining sector so and in the QSR sectors. So I think that's encouraging as we start to open back up.
AnthonyPaolone: Okay. Thank you for that. And then another question as I look at your expiration schedule. You got a couple points this year about 7% next year, is there any portion of that you know at this point is going to vacate that could be a challenge or that's notable for us?
GlennRufrano: Yes. I mean nothing particular as you know that we do have 7% coming due next year and we work hard at chipping away at that stuff in advance. So you noticed in my prepared remarks that we had some early renewals and those early renewals actually hits even further out in 2022 and 2023. In 2021m the expirations are pretty granular. We have sort of 180 leases in total that will expire, 70 to 75 each in retail and restaurants. So at this stage, don't see any particularly large holes where we say, oh, we think a large number those will not renew. We will move through the renewal process and we've been doing renewals even during the pandemic and even in some of the restaurants portfolio have been reasonably routine so far. So we'll see how that plays out in the coming months and I think you'll see us beginning to pull our 2021 expirations down as this year as a remainder of 2020 progresses.
AnthonyPaolone: Okay. Thanks and just last question for, Mike, with about 80% -81% collections seems like it's where you think the quarter will end up. Is anything you need to do from a debt or line covenant point of view that we should watch now for?
MikeBartolotta: No. We are fine on the covenants. I mentioned that in my remarks and we're fine from that perspective. And we believe that where we are right now, we've drawn down the line so that we have about $600 million of cash and quite $600 million available so we feel comfortable with that mix of having $1.2 billion of liquidity broken into those two pieces. So I don't see any issues on that. We have some debt coming due about $400 million in total this year. Most of that is $320 some-odd million right at the end of December on a convert. So obviously we'll be looking at how we'll refinance that going forward. A month ago the IG markets were BBB or BBB minus, were not as good in the last three weeks or so. They've gotten much better still a little bit pricey, but we have a lot of time between now and then to make that decision plus a lot of liquidity. As we've always tried, we'll keep our options open so that we make the right decision as to how we refining that obligation.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities. Go ahead.
ChrisLucas: Well. Hey, Glenn. Thanks. It's good to hear your voice and then I guess just generally a couple quick questions for you guys. Mike you mentioned about how you're thinking about the debt that's coming due at the end of the year. If you had to price your long-term debt today what sort of spread over treasuries do you think it would be at?
MikeBartolotta: I think today we're somewhere for a 10-year or somewhere around $450 million over Treasuries. I mean that there's been kind of a tremendous --the spread between the spreads of say A and BBB plus and then we're a mix of BBB minus and BBB right. We have one BBB and two BBB minus rating. So that's spread within the net lease group is pretty wide. So I would say right now we're somewhere in the 400 range on a 10-year between say 400 --
GlennRufrano: And, Chris, could I make one comment there because it's a very, very important subject for us in terms of pricing our capital and part of the balancing of the dividend that I discussed earlier. We hope will help us in the debt markets if we have to get into lease markets and we'd like to potentially this year so the spread and our ability to provide more cash flow in the balance sheet, we're hoping we get some momentum that it helps us there.
ChrisLucas: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Mike, just on the credit facility. Can you remind us is your EBITDA test, is that a single quarter, two quarters, annualized, four quarter trailing, what's that look like?
MikeBartolotta: It's a quarter annualized right now. That's the way we do the total asset test. You take the NOI and it's a 7% gross up and then you times it by four.
ChrisLucas: Okay. Were -well, and then I guess just going, Paul, maybe on the rent relief mechanics just so I understand them. You're basically offering two to four months then there's like a one-year pay back period. I guess I am just trying to understand when you guys starting to expect the payback period to start? Would it be after the end of the rent relief period or would there be some sort of interim period before that would start up?
PaulMcDowell: That's a good question and I would say that the answer to that runs the gamut. So, we have a variety of deferral requests and sometimes those deferral requests are for a 100% of rent; sometimes they're for percentages of the rent; 25% or 50% of the rent. We obviously negotiate each and every one and payback periods are sort of the same kind of ilk. Some payback periods we have running almost immediately after the deferral is over. And they run sometimes a pretty short period of time, a couple of months. Other payback periods we have where they start up after a couple of months with the tenant back at their normal rents to give them some breathing room. And build up some capital and then start to pay them again. A few we have deferred out into 2021 at least that's the idea right now, but again it's very, very dependent upon the tenants circumstance; the tenants financial situation and sort of our idea of how quickly we think they will recover and we as mentioned in my remarks too, we typically charge interest on deferral and sometimes that has an impact on the tenants’ desire to pay back their deferred balances more quickly.
ChrisLucas: Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess just when you're talking to tenants about their rent deferral request does the PPP program or Main Street Lending Program become a prerequisite for that conversation or how is that -- how are you factoring that into the conversation, if at all?
PaulMcDowell: Yes. No. We do factor it in and as I said before most of our tenants are large public companies or large private companies. So a lot of them except in the restaurant portfolio most didn't really qualify for PPP, but what we have in our agreements that we're working on with our various tenants at the moment is generally if they receive funds from the government that can be earmarked for rent. They need to pay those funds to us in rent and that's not generally controversial as we talk to these tenants. So they say, look, we get money from the government, we're happy to send it to you in the form of rent.
ChrisLucas: Okay. And then my last question just as it relates to the leasing activity particularly the early renewals, were there any sort of rent relief structures that were part of that or is it truly just early renewal type activity?
PaulMcDowell: No. Yes, the early renewal activity we had was sort of the standard early renewal activity that we have and we mentioned no recapture rates and so and so forth. And so very often when we do what we would call a blended colloquially, a blend and extend. We typically or we occasionally will grant some free rent or some rent reductions upfront in exchange for a much, much longer lease, which gives us obviously an improved net asset value. So sometimes we'll trade a little of upfront rent in exchange for the longer-term lease, but the activity that we had in the first quarter on early renewals in that vein was completely routine.
Operator: Our next question is from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Go ahead.
SheilaMcGrath: I guess I was wondering I know it's early but I was just wondering what your expectations are for pricing on acquisition? Do you expect cap rates to increase despite the low interest rate environment? And do you expect any differentiation between like restaurant or experiential tenants to widen out more than grocery or pharmacy?
GlennRufrano: Tom, maybe I'll start and then I may kick it to you. Tom as mentioned before which I would agree with retail is really tough. I'm not sure how you would price some of the entertainment properties today or even I'm sure there's some pricing on a grocer-anchored shopping center, but I think that's pretty difficult and I don't think there's a lot of comps there. So I would agree with what Tom said before retail right now if there is a bid-ask, it's wide and so very difficult to figure out. The only assets that I think Tom has been looking at where there is some pricing is investment-grade, industrial and investment-grade office. And Tom, why don't you just kind of come back on those two -- we see those two more often now because we're still looking at them for industrial partnership and our office partnerships. So Tom?
TomRoberts: Yes. Glenn, I would agree an experiential retail any type of fitness entertainment is just -- there's just not a lot of activity in the market. So I would agree that just not been priced. As Glenn mentioned, we are very active in the industrial and the office fronts with our partners and there again there's not a lot of trades. I think generally unless you really had to sell it you're going to put things on hold for 60-90 days. There has been some transactions that have awarded a bidder and I think as I mentioned earlier probably 10-20 basis point adjustment upward in the cap rate which is a very small percentage below 5%. So we think those are held up really well. I mean just the product types industrial is generally probably the number one product type in the market that has fared very well with e-commerce.  So those prices as you would expect have maintained very strong by comparison. And I think offices as well generally long term, decent credit, and good credit tenants that pricing hasn't moved much. And I think going forward we're obviously on hold and we'll just see where the market goes between now and year end.
SheilaMcGrath: Okay. Thank you. I guess we need new business interruption insurance.
GlennRufrano: Well, the ICFC as you probably know, Sheila, is working very hard on that. It's called -- they don't want to call it business interruption insurance because the insurance companies don't want to think of it that way, but so it's called the Recovery Act, a business Recovery Act and we've been before Congress as part of the ICFC. I've been helpful there at least in the last few weeks trying to in the fourth phase of government subsidy, provide for some of what you're asking for. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Glenn Rufrano for closing remarks.
Glenn Rufrano: I thank everybody for joining us today. And look forward to speaking to many of you over the next few months. We'll talk certainly at NAREIT. And I wish you the best. Thank you very much.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-20 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Realty Income fourth quarter and year end 2019 operating results conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Andrew Crum, Associate Director, Realty Income. Please go ahead.

Sumit Roy: Thanks, Andrew. Welcome everyone. We completed another year of strong operating performance delivering favorable risk adjusted returns for our shareholders. We are pleased to have provided our shareholders with more than 21.2% total shareholder return in 2019. During the year, we invested over $3.7 billion in real estate properties, an increase to AFFO per share by 4.1% to $3.32 per share. 2019 was a record year for property level acquisitions, and included approximately $798 million in international investments, including our first ever international sale leaseback of 12 properties located in the United Kingdom leased to Sainsbury's, a leading grocer. In 2019, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of our Company's founding and the 25th year since our public listing, and we were proud to be added to the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index earlier this month. But being an S&P 500 constituent that has raised its dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. We entered 2020 very well positioned across all areas of the business and are introducing 2020 AFFO per share guidance of $3.50 to $3.56, which represents annual growth rate of approximately 5.4% to 7.2%. Earlier this month, we announced that Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer is leaving the company. To ensure a smooth transition, Paul will serve as a Senior Advisor to the company through the end of the first quarter and the company has begun a search for a new Chief Financial Officer. I want to thank Paul for his valued partnership and tremendous contributions to the company over the many years. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased to 301 commercial tenants in 50 different industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the UK. 83% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at nearly 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.1% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 11.6% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 96% of our rent comes from tenants with a service non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of the recent US retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to feel good about the credit quality in the portfolio, with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties, it's 2.8 times on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list at 1.9% of rent is relatively consistent with our levels of the last few years. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the prior quarter. We expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2020. During the quarter we released 28 properties recapturing 106% of the expiring rent. During 2019 we released 214 properties recapturing 103% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold over 3,100 properties with leases expiring recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. Our same-store rental revenue increased 2% during the quarter and 1.6% during 2019, which is above our full year projection of approximately 1%, primarily due to the recognition of percentage rent. We expect same-store rent growth to normalize in 2020 and our projected run rate for 2020 is approximately 1%. Approximately 86% of our leases have contractual rent increases. Moving on, I will provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter and year, starting with the income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 4.3% for the quarter and 4.7% for the year, which was consistent with our full year projection of below 5%. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and expect our G&A margin to be approximately 5% in 2020. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of revenue was 1.4% for both the quarter and for the year, which was lower than our full year expectation in the 1.5% to 1.75% range. Briefly, turning to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain one of only a handful of REITs with at least AA ratings. During the fourth quarter, we raised $582 million of common equity primarily through our ATM program at approximately $75.52 per share. For the full year, we raised $2.2 billion of equity at approximately $72.40 per share, finishing the year with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.5 times. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 5 times, which is the highest coverage ratio we have reported for any quarter in our company's history. In January, we completed the early repayment of our $250 million 5.75%, 2021 bond through a full par call. Looking forward, our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape as the weighted average maturity of our bonds is 8.3 years, and we have only $334 million of debt coming due in 2020, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics, ample liquidity and excellent access to well priced capital. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we invested approximately $1.7 billion in 556 properties located in 42 states and the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.2 years. Approximately $1.2 billion of this quarters acquisitions were related to the CIM portfolio acquisition we announced in September. On a total revenue basis approximately 47% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment grade rated tenants. 100% of the revenues were generated from retail tenants. These assets are leased to 78 different tenants in 26 industries last year. Some of the more significant industries represented are convenience stores, dollar stores and drug stores. We closed 12 discrete transactions in the fourth quarter and approximately 10% of fourth quarter investment volume was sale-leaseback transactions. Off the $1.7 billion invested during the quarter, $1.5 billion was invested domestically in 551 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 7% and with a weighted average lease term of 10.6 years. During the quarter, $221 million was invested internationally in five properties located in the UK at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 17.1 years. During 2019, we invested over $3.7 billion in 789 properties located in 45 states and the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.5 years. On a revenue basis, 36% of total acquisitions are from investment grade rated tenants, 95% of the revenues are generated from retail and 5% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 112 different tenants in 31 industries. Of the 72 independent transactions closed in 2019, 11 transactions were above $50 million. Approximately 38% of 2019 investment volume was sale-leaseback transactions. Of the $3.7 billion invested in 2019, nearly $2.9 billion was invested domestically in 771 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 13 years. During 2019, approximately $798 million were invested internationally in 18 properties located in the UK at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.6 years. Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $11.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Of the $11.7 billion sourced during the quarter, $9.8 billion were domestic opportunities and $1.9 billion were international opportunities. Investment grade opportunities represented 17% of the volume sourced for the fourth quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during the fourth quarter, 58% were portfolios and 42% or approximately $5 billion were one-off assets. In 2019 we sourced approximately $57 billion in potential transaction opportunities which marks the highest annual volume sourced in our company's history. Of this $57 billion sourced in 2019, 42% were portfolios and 58% or approximately $33 billion were one-off assets. Of these opportunities, $45 billion were domestic opportunities and $12 billion were international opportunities. Of the $1.7 billion in total acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter 15% were one-off transactions. As to pricing, US investment grade properties are trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties are trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Regarding cap rates in the United Kingdom for the type of assets we are targeting, investment grade or implied investment grade properties are trading from the low 4% to high 5% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties are trading from the 5% to the low 7% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 325 basis points for domestic investments and 228 basis points for international investments, both of which were well above our historical average spreads. Our investment spreads for 2019 averaged 271 basis points for all of our investment activity, representing the widest annual spreads in our company's history. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less a nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our investment pipeline, both domestic and international remains robust, and we believe we are the only publicly traded net lease company that has the size, scale, and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. Based on the continued strength in our investment pipeline, as well as our excellent access to well priced capital, we are introducing 2020 acquisition guidance of $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion. Our disposition program remains active. During the quarter we sold 29 properties for net proceeds of $36.3 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.8% and we realized an unlevered IRR of 10.4%. This brings us to 92 properties sold in 2019 for $108 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1%, and we realized an unlevered IRR of 8.3%. We continue to improve the quality of our portfolio through the sale of non-strategic assets, recycling the sale proceeds into properties that benefit our investment parameters. We are expecting between $200 million and $225 million of dispositions in 2020, a large portion of which already closed earlier this month. In January, we increased the dividend for the 105th time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents an approximately 3% increase over the year ago period and equates to a payout ratio of 79% based on the midpoint of 2020 AFFO guidance. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.6%. And we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. To wrap it up, it was a successful and active year for us in 2019, and we look to continue the momentum in 2020. Our portfolio is performing well. Our global investment pipeline is robust and our cost of capital and ample liquidity positions us to capitalize on our growth initiatives. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Greg McGinniss: Hey, this is Greg McGinniss on with Nick. Digging into the acquisition guidance a bit. We're curious if you could give us estimated split between the US and UK, whether the EU's an option for 2020 and what cap rate are investment spread is assumed in the underwriting? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: The make up is going to be approximately 20% international, 80% domestic. And the spreads are going to be -- our hope is well north of our average spreads of 150 basis points, 160 basis points.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. So coming in a bit from what you guys accomplished and I'm assuming that's just more conservatism than anything else?
Sumit Roy: That's what we feel very comfortable sharing with the market. Obviously what happened last year is something that we expect to continue, but we feel very confident in being able to say that our range in the acquisition is going to be in the $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion. And we hope to do far better than our average spreads, which as I said was right around 150 basis points to 160 basis points. So yes, a certain level of conservatism.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. And then, so we know the acquisition guidance does not include potential portfolio acquisitions, but could you give us maybe some sense for what you're seeing out in the market today on that front. Are there portfolios currently being marketed to you, when you looking at any right now one that size. I'm just trying to get a sense what are reasonable upside as to acquisition guidance?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So let's be a little bit clear on what we are defining as portfolios. The large portfolio transaction that we did last year was at $1.1 billion CIM transaction, $1.2 billion CIM transaction. That's the kind of transaction that hasn't been sort of built into our $2.25 billion to $2.75 billion number. Clearly we are in the market and are constantly doing portfolio sizes in the range of $100 million to $200 million, and those are very much part and parcel of what's included in our guidance. Look, we've shared with you what the sourcing numbers were for 2019. We haven't seen any let up in terms of what we are seeing. So far and so early in the year, we are very optimistic about the pipeline and we are very optimistic of meeting the guidelines that we have shared with the market. And at this point, there is nothing that we are seeing in the horizon that would lead us to believe that this is going to be a much slower year than what we saw last year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open.
Christy McElroy: Hey, good morning Sumit. Thank you. Just with a pickup in some of the open-air retailers filing for bankruptcy and announcing closures in recent months, and also reports of others hiring restructuring advisors. Can you talk about any specific tenants that you have exposure to that fall into this category or any pocket of your exposure where you're concerned about fallout, if you look into the next year.
Sumit Roy: There are some tenants that we are obviously looking at very closely. The good news here is we are so well diversified Christy that these are tenants that have very minimal, well below 1% exposure to. For instance, PO1 is one of our tenants that we are looking at, it's been on our credit watch list for a while. We have 12 assets with them, it's right around 10 basis points of rent. We did a sale leaseback with them in 1998 and it's actually been a great transaction for us. So we are almost indifferent as to what happens with them on 9 of the 12 properties we already getting inbound calls from large national tenants, that gives us very high level of confidence that we would be able to reposition this asset. A couple of other names that we are keeping a close eye on Crystal's is another one that we acquired through a large portfolio again basis points of rent and based on the four-wall coverage we feel our portfolio is very well positioned. And once again, but that's a corporate level credit that is in the news and one that we are looking at very closely. But in aggregate, we have obviously taken all of this into account in forecasting out our AFFO per share guidance. And so you can tell from the guidance that we have laid out Christy that fingers crossed this year will again be a very, very good year for us.
Christy McElroy: And you talked about in your opening remarks, the spreads in market cap rates between investment grade and non-investment grade. Do you think those spreads are wide enough just given sort of that tenant followed environment where you're seeing, and I think I heard you say that about -- said that about 70% of the deals that you're sourcing are investment grade versus, I think it's 50% in place. So will there be a continued effort to sort of raise investment grade exposure?
Sumit Roy: Actually what we are seeing is something very interesting Christy. I would argue that some of the higher yielding assets have compressed with regards to cap rates, and are moving closer to investment grade cap rates are in the market. So it hasn't been a movement in the investment grade market that is as pronounced as it is in the higher yielding markets. So, one must take into consideration, on a risk adjusted basis, where are you better off investing. And I think we've shared this with you in the past, Christy, credit is very much part of the analysis that we undertake. But we are not pursuing a particular credit profile. We are looking at it in totality and trying to come up with for the risk that one is assuming are the returns appropriate. That's how we look at all of our investments. And -- but the point I want to make is high yielding assets that used to have a high 7%, even an 8% cap rate now trading at a 6% cap rate and investment grade assets that were potentially in the high 5s are in the low 5s. So it's a far more pronounced compression that we are seeing in the higher yielding side of the equation, and it does give us pause, when we look at it from a risk adjusted basis as to whether we should continue to pursue all of those transactions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shivani Sood with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Shivani Sood: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. As following up on these earlier question about portfolios, curious if you're seeing increased competition for larger portfolio acquisitions or sale leasebacks from private players in recent months. And how has that changed, how you're sourcing and approaching the process to remain ahead of that?
Sumit Roy: Shivani for us it's business as usual. We are not changing any of our methods of sourcing or pursuing potential transactions that have a risk profile that is not justified by the cap rates, that's being ascribed or that's being asked. I mean, we have, we did 89% of our transactions in 2019 were relationship driven transactions. We are continuing to pursue those. We continue to reach out to clients of ours that have credit that we feel very comfortable with. These are assets that don't even get marketed, and we continue to build on the sale leaseback side of the equation. And absent CIM, 61% of what we did last year was sale leaseback. So I wouldn't say that in any way we have altered the way that we are pursuing acquisitions. What we have done on the international side of the equation is, obviously, we have continued to establish new relationships with again having done the homework around clients that we would like to pursue over the long-term. And that has to been a major push for Neil and for myself to continue to grow our international platform. And thankfully, we've made a fair amount of progress on that front.
Shivani Sood: Thanks for that color. Just switching topics, the recap rate for occupied boxes is really good in the quarter. Can you share some more color on what drove that?
Sumit Roy: Yes, sure. So there were basically two things that drove that. And then as you can see our 2020 guidance is right around 1% which is traditionally being what we have said. Not every lease that we have has an annual rent growth. Some have rent growth every three years, some have rent growth every five years, and it just so happened that a disproportionate number of leases had growth coming in 2019. For instance, if you look at the Dollar stores, 46% of all the assets that we own within that bucket had an increase in 2019, and most of those were either a three or a five year rental increase, and that accounted for about 34% of the disproportionate increase in the rent, the 1.6% that we were able to achieve. On the second note a smaller contribution to the increase was the timing of the percentage rent accruals and that too helped. But if you were to take those two out of the equation, we would be right around what we have guided the market to for 2020.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open.
Rob Stevenson : Good afternoon. How are you feeling these days about the office segment. I mean you've added one asset in the last year. Is that a source of dispositions going forward? Is that a source of acquisitions going forward? I mean what's the -- how do you think about that over the next three years?
Sumit Roy: Rob, so as far as I know, our exposure to office has continued to dwindle over the last few years. It used to be north of 6% at one stage, today it's in the 3% zip code. And it's a product type that we have accumulated largely through large portfolio transactions. We haven't proactively gone out and bought some single-tenant net leased office asset. Having said that, the commentary I'm sharing with you is very much a US based commentary, but I suspect that it is going to be very similar even in the international market. So our view regarding office has not changed. It's asset type that we are very cautious about and we tend to be very, very selective when we even take a particular opportunity and do a deep dive into underwriting the opportunities.
Rob Stevenson : Okay. And then I guess the other question for me winds up being when you take a look at the balance sheet over the next couple of years, a lot of sort of heavy lifting has been done. I mean, where -- is there any sort of opportunities out there for you guys to pick up anything over the next couple of years with rates bottoming yet again?
Sumit Roy: To me that is such a tertiary mechanism or tool to utilize to help grow our earnings. And I'm glad that you observe that by and large, our efficiency around our balance sheet financing has largely been realized. There is another unsecured that has a high 4% coupon, I believe in 2023, but that's one that we -- depending on where the interest rate environment is, we might take a look at taking out, but that is such a tertiary consideration when I think about what are the drivers of AFFO per share growth. But yes, I'm very happy. Jonathan, are there any other points you would like to make?
Jonathan Pong: Yes, Rob, I think when you look out over the next few years through 2023, we obviously ticked down the 2021 in January, but in '23 and '24, we do have $1.7 million of debt that's maturing, but 2022 early in the quarter, but 2023 our [indiscernible] and so knock on wood rates stay low. It's interesting that a 3.25% coupon today is fairly high. So what we are looking at liability management ideas we're always thinking about how the make whole math kind of translates into a breakeven rate, if we were to refinance certain piece of the capital stack and you can expect us to continue doing that on a go-forward basis.
Rob Stevenson : And just preferred have any place in the capital stack going forward?
Sumit Roy: We could issue in the mid to high 4s today on the preferred side. It's always something that we'll look at. But when you look at the indicative cost for us of 30-year unsecured paper, that's in the low 3% range today. That gap doesn't make a lot of sense for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Hawthorne with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Brian Hawthorne: Hi. How comfortable are you with your C-store exposure and how high would you be OK with it going?
Sumit Roy: We are very comfortable with the kind of tenants that we have exposure to that largely constitute our industry exposure. 7-Eleven, Couche-Tard, under the Circle K banner, those are names that we are very comfortable with. They are the best-in-class convenience store operators and we monitor their business. We have a very close relationship with them. And we are very comfortable there. What we are not comfortable with are, the smaller format kiosk type C-stores that heavily rely on fuel sale to drive profitability. And thankfully those are largely out of our portfolio. We do have some, but by and large, most of that 11% exposure is being driven by 7-Eleven and Circle K.
Brian Hawthorne: Okay. And then have your tenants talked about rising wages impacting their coverages at all? The coverage ratios?
Sumit Roy: We went through how many, it was like north of 200 leases, and the fact that I'm sure those conversations in every -- not there in every tenant conversations, but I'm sure in some cases, those conversations had to have alluded to higher labor costs. But by and large, we are happy to report that our tenants are doing fairly well, and the fact that we were able to recapture 103% net of expiring rents leads one to believe that at least the kinds of tenants that we have exposure to are not insulated but are able to absorb the higher labor costs.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisor. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Spenser Allaway : Thank you. In terms of the $12 billion of deals you guys sourced international this year, can you provide a little color on what particular property types or industries you are seeing most heavily marketed abroad?
Sumit Roy: It's largely grocers, it's C-stores, it's movie theaters, it's discount retail, those are the buckets that they would fall in, as well as some industrial.
Spenser Allaway : Okay and then just going back to the previous question on the recent wave of bankruptcies and ongoing headwinds in the retail segment. Do you suspect that we could see capex eventually creep higher in the net lease segment just in terms of TIs or potential deferred caped on any vacant assets?
Sumit Roy: We saw the exact opposite. Our capex has largely been consistent over the last three years. And what has actually reduced was our property expenses. If you notice, we were forecasting to the market that it would be anywhere between 1.5% to 1.75%, and we ended up being at 1.4%. And the reason -- there were two reasons for that. One was that the property taxes that we were forecasting on our vacant assets was far more than what we actually realized, given that we were able to sell our vacant assets at very attractive or total returns. And obviously the top line grew well in advance of what we had forecasted. So those two factors resulted in the property expense margins coming in below 1.5%. We are not seeing our capex numbers changing based on the current climate. And I think it's largely due to the type of retail that we invest in. Its net lease, if it's working for the tenant, they are happy to invest the capex themselves, reposition the assets to continue to remain relevant and drive profitability out of the store. And that's why the net lease industry tends to be a very, very efficient industry. But again, it is absolutely a function of the clients that one chooses to create an exposure to. And if it's the wrong set of clients, I'd say Spencer that that could have a different effect, but on our portfolio we are not seeing it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Todd Stender: Thanks. Looking at the average lease term, it's now just over nine years. It's been hedging lower and you guys have certainly acknowledged that. Can you talk about the recent releasing activity. Maybe in the term that they're renewed for. Your acquisitions have on average been higher than that average, but the portfolio average keeps drifting lower. Maybe just talk about releasing if you don't mind?
Sumit Roy: Yes, sure. And this is something we've talked about in the past as well Todd. If you think about it, at least -- lease the original lease tends to have a 15 year, 20 year or even 25 year sale leaseback. And then you have options built into these leases and those options tend to be five-year options. And this is all disclosed in our supplemental. If you look at our history of releasing and we've done north of 3,000 leases. 88% and it's been higher more recently. 80% to 90% of the existing tenants exercise these options. And so when you reset the lease term, it's right around the five year timeframe. It's only when we are going out and retenanting it with a new tenant or finding a new tenant even with zero vacancies that we have the opportunity to go beyond the five to something like a 10, and those have average in the six to seven years zip code. And so if we were to do no acquisitions, I think the normalized run rate for a net lease company, a very, very mature net lease company which is doing zero acquisitions or very little as a percentage of their overall portfolio. The normalized weighted average lease term is going to be right around six to seven years. And that's where the asset management and real estate operations team comes into play. And we have anticipated this and set the team up accordingly. And I think the results speak for themselves. On a quarterly basis, we share with you what the releasing spread is, and we share with you what's the capital invested was -- with regards to tenant incentives etc, and more often than not they tend to be zero. And we've been capturing north of 100% of the expiring rents. 103% this year. It was similar number last year and in this last quarter was 106%. So I believe that we have a team that in fact could be viewed as somebody that could create value, when these leases start to roll and we are able to maintain the kind of releasing activity that we have, being able to achieve over the last three to four years, that could become a growth driver for us. But clearly, new acquisitions, one should expect if it's a sale leaseback, it should be in that 15 to 20 years zip code and if it's acquired lease, it's going to have double-digit numbers. But as we become a bigger company and unless our acquisition numbers don't keep up on a pro rata basis, the weighted average lease term is going to continue to sort of get lower and should normalize right around seven years.
Todd Stender: To that extension option number. Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you, Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Sure. Of course.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.
John Massocca: Good afternoon. So you mentioned -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks there was significant -- if I heard you correctly, that significant portion of expected 2020 disposition activity closed earlier this month. Can you provide some color on what drove that?
Sumit Roy: Sure. We are under an NDA, so I have to be very careful. But it was one of our clients who did a strategic review of their real estate operations and approached us to buy back some of the assets that they had leased to us or vice versa that we had leased to them. And it was a very attractive return. We had five years left on the portfolio. And we were able to transact with them and that closed, I believe, early part of last week, and it was to the tune of about $116 million. So if you subtract out the $116 million in dispositions, you're back up to a right around $108 million and that's around the levels of what we achieved in 2019.
John Massocca: Okay that makes sense. Then as we kind of think about dispositions outside of that transaction. How much I guess is potentially being driven by the CIM portfolio and maybe kind of fine-tuning that portfolio more to kind of what you guys want to hold long-term?
Sumit Roy: Yes. This is the question that we've answered before, when we had announced the CIM transaction. This was a $1.2 billion transaction. We had said that $1 billion worth of the assets that we purchased were ones that we would buy in the open market, if they were available one-off. There's about $200 million worth of assets that we are going to asset manage more aggressively, and by that we had also bucketed that $200 million into some of them are going to be made available for immediate marketing and that's about 25% call it plus, minus. And the rest we would collect the rent for as long as the tenants continues to pay rent. And because of the location, because of the rent per square feet, we feel very good about being able to reposition those assets with potentially new tenants. And so that was the way that we underwrote the $200 million worth that would require more attention, if you will. And that hasn't changed. That's precisely the way we are thinking about the CIM portfolio.
John Massocca: Okay. But then when you think about dispositions on kind of a net basis with that, let's say $50 million that maybe a little more immediately ready for repositioning within the CIM portfolio. It would seem to imply then I guess maybe less disposition activity versus what you guys accomplished this year or is that the wrong way of thinking about it and all this will be kind of blended together?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Because, are you guaranteeing me that you are going to be able to -- we'll be able to sell those $50 million this year in 2020? We don't -- we didn't underwrite, thinking that we were going to be able to sell 25% of that portfolio that $200 million portfolio in 2020. So it is certainly a blend John. We would love to be able to achieve that. And if we are, we might come back and say to you later on in the year that our disposition numbers may be north of what we have gone out with. But there is certainly a level of flexibility that we've built into those disposition numbers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Vikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the question. Just on, going back to sort of the tenant health issues referenced being really small, several on the restaurant side. There were several names that have cropped up. NBC, Crystal etc. I'm just wondering maybe taking a step back restaurants remain kind of part and parcel of the net lease business. But are you thinking about restaurant slightly differently going forward, maybe on a three, five year basis between public, private, franchisee, direct, corporate-owned, any specific segments. I think any color there would be useful. Just because we've seen a couple of tenant crop up.
Sumit Roy: Sure, Vikram. Thanks for your question. We have -- and I am not sharing anything new here. We have been very cautious about the casual dining concept. And more importantly, even if the concept is a good one, we have been very careful about exposing ourselves to small scale franchisees. And so, those factors continue to remain front and center any time we are looking at transactions. And largely what you see playing out in the restaurant space today is not unexpected, and so we are very well -- thankfully, we are very well positioned for the worst outcome in some of what you have just shared in terms of the names and others that we are monitoring. And in fact, our expected outcome on this very small exposure that we have is still going to be north of what we have underwritten in terms of our guidance is my belief. But our thinking has always been very cautious on the casual dining side. It has been more positive on the quick service restaurant side and even within the quick service restaurants there are other drivers such as [indiscernible] need to have a certain number of units, they need to have a certain number of scale that would give us comfort, even if the corporate concept is one that that we find very interesting. So those hurdles have not changed.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay, great. And sorry if I missed this. I dialed in late. But on the international side, I heard you reference a couple of categories you were exploring, but just curious kind of how the pipeline looks between the UK and then broadly Continental Europe?
Sumit Roy: Look, our focus is still very much the UK, that's the geography that we decided to go into first for obvious reasons. We feel very comfortable with that. But we are starting to see some very interesting concepts coming out of Western Europe as well. And we are doing our diligence. Niel's making several trips across the pond to explore those opportunities. So I'm not going to keep those off the table, but in terms of the make up, I think you should expect 20% of the volume plus, minus to come from the international market. And I'd love to be surprised and that's a challenge for Neil. But the vast bulk of our acquisitions will still be US domiciled.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Collin Mings from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Collin Mings: First one for me, again this is something that's been discussed on a few prior calls. Obviously a lot of competition out there for industrial assets. Nothing closed during the quarter. Can you maybe just update us on what you're seeing on that front and maybe just talk a little bit about the pipeline on that front going forward?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Collin, the way you started asking the question is precise. There is a lot of competition. There are many people chasing single-tenant industrial assets. And yes, we haven't been able to get any over the finish line in the last quarter. We've been close on a few occasions, but did not -- chose not to continue to pursue the aggressiveness on the cap rate side, but it is something, it's a product that we like. It is an exposure to a certain certain types of tenants that we would find as being very complementary to what we already have. It's just that we haven't been able to actively get a lot of transactions over the finish line yet.
Collin Mings: Okay. And then, I did want to follow-up, actually now in a couple of questions on the deal flow on the international front. You've referenced a couple of times again targeting plus or minus 20% of your activity in 2020 will fall to your international bucket. So as you think about targeting call it rough numbers $500 million or so of opportunities. Just curious if you can maybe drill down a little bit more. You mentioned a few things in response to Spenser's question in terms of the different sectors or property types you're seeing a lot of the deal flow. Can you maybe just elaborate a little bit more on where you think you are going to be able to reach the closing table this year on some of those opportunities. And then just, again, as you think about the relationships you've built in the regions to elaborate a little bit more on that as well.
Sumit Roy: Yes. It's very difficult to tell precisely where within those different buckets are we going to end up. Let's just look at historically what we have been able to achieve. The large part of the 18 transactions that we -- 18 properties that we acquired, 17 were in the grocer -- were grocery stores and they were the big four grocers in the UK and one happen to be a theater. And so the bulk of the transactions that we are seeing is with the big four. But there are some other transactions that we are starting to see that are very interesting. And I'm not in a position to share with you names of tenants, etc with whom we've -- we are making a lot of progress. That is something, as you can understand for competitive reasons. We'd like to get it over the finish line and then be in a position to talk about it more freely. But our conversations is broader than the grocery industry is what I can share with you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Haendel St. Juste: Hey, good afternoon. I don't know if I missed it, I don't think I did, but did you mention any update on the search for a new CFO. And if you haven't, could you comment on where that search stand. And what's embedded in the 2020 guidance from both the separation cost and a potential hiring of a new CFO?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So look, we have hired a search firm. We have created a profile and we are out in the market looking for the right individual to join the team, that's where we are with regards to the CFO search. The good news is Paul is very much here with us, acting as a Senior Advisor, and will continue to be with us through the end of March. The fact that we have a very strong team with Jonathan Pong and Sean driving our Capital Markets and Finance Departments and Sean driving our Accounting, we feel very comfortable that we don't have to be in a hurry to replace that particular role. We have a very strong team. Our focus is going to be in terms of finding the right person with the right cultural fit and can help be a partner to us in helping drive the next evolution of this company. And we are not going to take an expeditious route to get there. I mean we want to get this right. With regards to your second question or part of your question is around severance, it's just south of $2 million that is going to impact both the G&A as well as our FFO numbers. And yes, I think those were your questions.
Haendel St. Juste: Thank you for that. And as a follow-up of sorts, what level of international build-out cost is reflected in the current G&A guide? Remind us again how many people you've committed currently already to your international platform and where you envision that by year-end?
Sumit Roy: Yes. So look, we already have a small office in London. We have one person who is driving the business there. We have outsourced a fair amount of the administrative work that is required, i.e., accounting, tax as well as legal, it is quite possible based on the analysis that we have done that in-sourcing some of these functions may make sense. If the growth in our portfolio continues or accelerates the in-sourcing is going to accelerate. So we are very comfortable with the controls that we have in place and the process that we have implemented and it's a structure that allows us to be incredibly flexible. What we have committed to is to higher one other person in the UK, but the number of people who eventually become part of Realty Income Limited will remain to be seen. And it's going to be partially driven by the size of the portfolio that we are able to create. And so having that flexibility, allows us to be much more nimble when it comes to the G&A load that is associated with the platform.
Haendel St. Juste: Got it, got it. Thank you for that. And then maybe one more if you entertain me for a second. Curious on -- I guess what your view is on if you feel credit, tenant credits being fairly valued in today's market and whether size is an advantage or maybe a disadvantage for maybe some of your smaller peers have been able to grow faster in an environment where growth seems to have been prioritized over the past year or so. Does that make you any more or less inclined to perhaps consider splitting the company may be into a higher credit and maybe lower credit bucket or perhaps some transaction to in effect make the company a bit smaller or any other strategic change on that front.
Sumit Roy: Look that's a whole lot of questions that you have sort of built into this one question. What I can tell you Haendel is, we went through a very deep dive, I'd say now about 16 months ago, 15 months ago, and we feel very comfortable that our size, scale, and cost of capital, first and foremost is very portable and is a massive advantage to us as we have started to show. We can do, very large scale sale leaseback and it does not create immediate tenant concentration issues for us. We can be the one-stop shop for existing tenants and have transactions come to us without it -- without then feeling the need to have to go and test the markets, and that's value to them, it's value to us. It allows us to pursue proprietary software that we are developing in-house, that is going to help us drive the lifecycle of Real Estate within our business. Those are things that comes because we have size and scale. And we believe that we have created enough adjacent verticals and/or are exploring enough verticals, where we will be able to provide a growth rate that is very comparable to all of our net lease peers. And the fact that we have the lower cost of capital, and the fact that we have scale, and the fact that we have size, those are all benefits that should ultimately accrue to us. So until that equation changes, I don't see us having to explore. You know what was it that you said spin-offs or high yielding or lower yielding asset base. I mean this is part of our underwriting and it's in fact, a strength of our underwriting, that allows us to pursue the full spectrum of credit tenants and opportunities and it's what helps us drive growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christy McElroy from Citi. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman: Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Christy. Sumit forget about a spin, but just thinking about disposition volumes, right, because on one hand, it would be highly dilutive relative to buying something with your cost of capital, being able to sell obviously on asset at much higher cap rate than where you're effectively funding your costs. So recognizing that there is some dilutive aspect to selling assets. I would have thought just given your comments about how the markets pricing non-investment grade, given your size and scale of your portfolio that you would be able to look for either industry tenant or geographical potential concerns where you may want to take a more aggressive approach at shrinking the base, so that the ad of things that you're doing all these verticals that you're in, and having international and having your cost of capital from the debt and equity perspective, provides that much more bottom line growth over time and so that you're not going to be faced with something that comes down the road 12 to 24 months. I would just imagine out of your portfolio there has got to be more than $50 million or $75 million of dispositions, I think you'd want to do, if you really took a hard look at the portfolio?
Sumit Roy: And we are constantly doing that, Michael. We are constantly looking at the portfolio. We are trying to figure out what is the best economic outcome. Despite the fact that the cap rates seem very aggressive, what do we feel we can sell a given asset at versus holding on to that asset, collecting the lease and selling it vacant at the end. That's an analysis that we are constantly doing. The advantage that we have is so many of our assets and I talked about the PO1 example, we did a sale leaseback on those 12 assets that we own in 1998. We can sell those assets for ground and come out with higher single digit unlevered IRRs. But the fact is their rent is current. We are going to collect the rent and when they -- if they decide that they want to hand over some of the assets back to us at that point, we could do the exact same thing that we can do it today, but we have a few more months of rent collected. So it really comes down to an economic argument. And I think what differentiates us is we are constantly doing that on the assets that we have identified as not long-term holds. And in some situations, we have decided the selling it today is absolutely the right economic outcome because the rent we're collecting perhaps is not enough to justify holding it till the rent starts coming in. And that's where that $100 million and in this year $200 million of disposition number comes in. I think if you add up everything we've done over the last six years, it's north of a $1 billion of assets that we have sold. And it's not to avoid the dilution. You're absolutely right. That is a third level, fourth level consideration, but it's not the driver of the decision making process. It is really the economic analysis that we undertake Michael.
Michael Bilerman: Your company is two times just over the last five years and you go last 10 years it's 4 times, right. Just in terms of size of the asset base. I guess, and I know the benefits of size and scale in terms of your cost of capital helping driving additional growth and allows you to do things as you said without getting a tenant concentration issue. For others, they may not want to take off as much of a portfolio been certain vertical because of that. I just, I guess I'm surprised that there isn't -- and look maybe all the investments you've made have been great, and you don't have a lot of issues, I guess I'm just surprised that there isn't that more aggressiveness of recycling of portfolio, especially in this environment where credit is being I think mispriced?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Look, we continue to keep looking at it Michael. And who knows, maybe in a few years we'll come out and or not even a few years, maybe in 12 months will come out and say we may need to do more. But right now we feel fairly comfortable that I think we've -- based on the analysis that we've done. We are comfortable with the $200 million of dispositions.
Michael Bilerman: Have your views changed on public to public M&A within the net lease space, and sort of where is your mindset today, especially given your comments about size and scale and being bigger and being able to inherit other problems and dispose or they're not as big of a problem for you as they are of the target?
Sumit Roy: We've always been open to M&A, Michael. It's -- the question that we have wrestled with and the reason why we haven't been able to move forward has always been, do we have a seller out there that's willing to essentially sell their -- sell themselves. And if that situation were to occur, we would absolutely engage in a conversation. The question is, you look around the net lease space today and you see all of the net lease companies are trading at very high multiples. All of them seem to have a process identified to continue to grow their business. Within that environment, do you see someone raising their hand and saying, look, we would like to engage. If that happens, we are not going to shy away from engaging in that conversation and pursuing M&A.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing everyone at the upcoming conference. Thank you, Kenzie.
Operator: Thank you, this concludes today's conference call, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-05 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2019 Operating Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After speaker's presentation, there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Andrew Crum, Senior Associate Realty Income. You may begin.
Andrew Crum: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter 2019 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from any of the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Andrew. Welcome everyone. We are pleased to complete another solid quarter. We remain on track for a very strong 2019 and are well positioned as we look towards 2020 with a robust investment pipeline and strong liquidity. During the quarter, we invested approximately $412 million in high-quality real estate at investment spreads well above our historical average which brings us to approximately $2 billion invested as we enter the fourth quarter. Our investment activity during the quarter included our second international acquisition in the U.K. Additionally, our investments during the quarter were 51% industrial by rent with approximately $234 million invested through three separate transactions with three new investment grade-rated tenants including our first-ever distribution facility leased to a large e-commerce retailer. Including the previously announced portfolio acquisition from CIM Real Estate Finance Trust we have announced over $3 billion in acquisitions year-to-date. As a reminder, the CIM transaction is expected to close in various tranches with the acquisition of most of the properties in the portfolio expected to close in 2019. To fund our activity we raised $572 million in equity capital during the quarter ending the quarter with $236 million of cash on hand and positioning our balance sheet favorably for the remainder of the year and as we look towards 2020. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end our properties were leased to 274 commercial tenants in 49 different industries located in 49 states Puerto Rico and the U.K. 82.7% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at nearly 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.7% of rental revenue. Convenience store remains our largest industry at 11.6% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to feel good about the credit quality in the portfolio with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail portfolio is 2.8 times on a four-wall basis while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list at 1.7% of rent is relatively consistent with our levels of the last few years. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3% flat versus the prior quarter. We continue to expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2019. During the quarter, we re-leased 29 properties recapturing 101.5% of the expiring rent. Year-to-date we have re-leased 186 properties recapturing 102.1% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,100 properties with leases expiring recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Our same-store rental revenue increased 1.2% during the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. Our projected run rate for 2019 continues to be approximately 1%. Approximately 86% of our leases have contractual rent increases. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results.
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of revenue excluding reimbursements was 4.6% for the quarter and 4.8% year-to-date both of which were below the comparable year ago periods. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, and we expect our G&A margin to remain below 5% in 2019. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursements was 1.3% for the quarter and year-to-date periods, which is better than our full year expectation in the 1.5% to 1.75% range. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.83 per share for the quarter, which represents a 2.5% increase. Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and we remain one of only a few REITs with at least two A ratings. As Sumit mentioned, during the third quarter, we raised approximately $572 million of common equity almost entirely through our ATM program. Use of proceeds were repaid borrowings on our line of credit and to pre-fund an active acquisition pipeline, including of course the large CIM portfolio acquisition. We finished the quarter with nothing outstanding on our $3 billion line of credit and approximately $236 million of cash on hand. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.0 times and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.7 times. Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, as the weighted average maturity of our bonds is 8.5 years and we have only $1.2 million of debt coming due in the remainder of 2019. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter with just over $300 million of debt maturing in both 2020 and 2021. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and excellent liquidity. Now let me turn the call back over to Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Paul. During the third quarter of 2019, we invested approximately $412 million in 51 properties located in 23 states in the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.7% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.4 years. On a total revenue basis approximately 56% of total acquisitions are from investment grade-rated tenants. 49% of the revenues are generated from retail and 51% are generated from industrial. The weighted average initial cash cap rate on industrial acquisitions during the quarter was in the low 5% range, while the weighted average cap rate on retail acquisitions was in the mid 6% range. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are general merchandise, food processing and childcare. We closed 15 discrete transactions in the third quarter and approximately 23% of the third quarter investment volume were sale-leaseback transactions. Of the $412 million invested during the quarter, $384 million was invested domestically in 50 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.1 years. During the quarter, $27.6 million was invested internationally in one property located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 4.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 20.6 years. Year-to-date 2019, we invested $2 billion in 241 properties, located in 38 states and the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.5 years. On a revenue basis, 25% of total acquisitions are from investment grade-rated tenants. 90% of the revenues are generated from retail and 10% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 45 different tenants in 19 industries. Of the 60 independent transactions closed year-to-date, six transactions were above $50 million. Approximately 65% of our year-to-date investment for volume was sale-leaseback transactions. Of the $2 billion invested year-to-date, nearly $1.5 billion was invested domestically in 228 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.7 years. Year-to-date approximately $577 million has been invested internationally in 13 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15 years. Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $15 billion in the third quarter. Of the $15 billion sourced during the quarter, $9 billion were domestic opportunities and $6 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 33% of the volume sourced for the third quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during the third quarter, 31% were portfolios and 69% or approximately $10.4 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date 2019, we have sourced $45.4 billion in potential transaction opportunities, which marks the highest annual volume sourced in our company's history. Of these opportunities, $35.6 billion were domestic opportunities and $9.9 billion were international opportunities. This continues to confirm our belief that our investment -- international investment pipeline is truly incremental to our domestic business. Of the $45.4 billion sourced year-to-date, 38% were portfolios and 62% or approximately $28.2 billion were one-off assets. Of the $412 million in total acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 84% were one-off transactions. As to pricing cap rates in the U.S. were essentially unchanged in the third quarter. Investment-grade properties are trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties are trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Regarding cap rates in the United Kingdom for the types of assets we are targeting, investment-grade or implied investment-grade properties are trading from the low 4% to high 5% cap rate range. Non-investment-grade properties are trading from mid-4% to low 7% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter averaging approximately 198 basis points for domestic investments and 188 basis points for international investments both of which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our investment pipeline remains robust and we believe we are the only publicly traded net lease company that has the size, scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale-leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. We were pleased to announce a diversified portfolio acquisition from CIM Real Estate Finance Trust for approximately $1.25 billion during the quarter, which further demonstrates the advantages of size and scale in the net lease industry. We continue to expect 2019 acquisition guideline -- guidance of $3.25 billion to $3.5 billion. Our disposition program remains active. During the quarter we sold 27 properties for net proceeds of $21.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.4% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.6%. This brings us to 63 properties sold year-to-date for $71.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.1%. We continue to improve the quality of our portfolio through the sale of nonstrategic assets recycling the sales proceeds into properties that better fit our investment parameters. We continue to expect between $75 million and $100 million of dispositions in 2019. In September, we increased the dividend for the 103rd time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents an approximately 3% increase over the year ago period and equates to a payout ratio of 82.2% based on the midpoint of 2019 AFFO guidance. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.5%. We are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. To wrap it up, we completed another strong quarter and are very well-positioned as we look towards 2020. Our portfolio continues to perform well, our investment pipeline remains healthy and we are conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to pursue additional growth initiatives. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi. Your line is open. 
Christy McElroy: Hi. Thanks, guys. Just following up on your comments on the industrial acquisitions in Q3. How much of the volume of the industrial deals was the large e-commerce retailer that you referred to? And what was the difference in cap rate on that deal versus the other industrial deals?
Sumit Roy: That's represented approximately 40% of the overall investments in industrial. And the cap rates in all three assets were fairly close to each other. They were right around slightly north of 5%.
Christy McElroy: Is there more to do with this or other large e-commerce retailers? And how do you think about that, sort of, investment relative to your -- historically what you've done in industrial and kind of relative to what you do in retail?
Sumit Roy: Look, we've always said that there are two asset types that we are very focused on retail obviously being the bread and butter and the preponderance of what we do and that will always be the case. But industrial continues to be an asset type that we are very attracted to. There are points in time where we can make investments in very high-quality tenants with growth rates embedded in these leases that are well above what we have in our overall portfolio with very long-term leases. And that is a very attractive proposition for us, especially, when we can finance it and capture spreads right around our long-term averages, which is precisely what we were able to accomplish this particular quarter. So we were very happy with the ability to transact, especially on these three assets and -- with some of the provisions that I've shared with you it made it that much more attractive.
Christy McElroy: Okay. And then just lastly on the funding for the CIM acquisition and other, sort of, incremental deal volume in Q4. We could see where you're at Q3. And from a funding perspective you closed on an additional billion or you closed on that first billion tranche from CIM after Q3. And where are you, sort of, in your funding you've got a cash balance and then you've got your line of credit. Is your intention to do another bond deal near term? And any, sort of, incremental ATM issuance that you plan for Q4?
Sumit Roy: The beauty of our balance sheet today Christy is that we can pretty much access a variety of capital some of which we obviously pre-funded through the ATM in the third quarter. But having a leverage debt-to-EBITDA of 5.0 at the end of the third quarter gives us the ability to certainly access the unsecured market or the equity market given where we trade. So I don't want to share with you precisely what our financing plans are, but -- because we are analyzing it, looking at it on a day-in day-out basis, but it will be a combination of that along with some of the dispositions and the free cash flow from operations that we are going to be generating.
Christy McElroy: Okay. Thanks so much for the time.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shivani Sood with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. 
Shivani Sood: Hey, good afternoon. Just on the disposition side, it looks like you guys have cycled the fair amounts of vacant boxes. So just curious if that was driven by something specific or just trying to take advantage of the very competitive private markets right now.
Sumit Roy: Thanks for the question, Shivani. I'm glad you've brought up this thing about vacant assets and why we -- why there was such a preponderance of vacant asset sales. It is not by design that we decided on this particular quarter to have more vacant asset sales. The advantage of being a net lease company is that we are able to look at every asset, freestanding asset and make a determination as to what is the best economic outcome. Holding on to a vacant asset and incurring some of the carrying costs is justifiable, if our belief is that we can get a tenant that is willing to pay rents that justify the carrying costs and the overall return profile is superior to what we are able to get when we sell a vacant asset in the open market. And if that equation sort of does not yield that holding on to an asset is warranted, we go to the market and we sell it at a price and that's precisely what we did this particular quarter. But I wouldn't read one way or the other in terms of whether we are going to do more vacant asset sales going forward versus not. This is a decision that our asset management team is involved in on a day-in day-out basis, where they are constantly determining what is the right strategy for a given asset. And it just so happens that in this particular quarter we had quite a few vacant asset sales.
Shivani Sood: Thanks for the color. It's really helpful. And then just wondering, if you can give us an update on your thoughts on just development as a component of the overall investment pipeline just given the higher relative yields, excuse me. Should we expect that -- to see that continue to increase if we stay in a lower for longer interest rate environment?
Sumit Roy: Shivani, that's a very good question. Once again, our development program has been anywhere between call it $35 million $36 million, which it is today, to as high as $150 million. And that continues to be an area that we are focused on. To the point that you've made regarding higher yield that is part of what the asset management team does. When we get an asset back, we are constantly thinking about -- one of the options that we explore is to see whether we can reposition those particular assets. And in some cases the answer is yes and that is the vast majority of the developments that we are currently involved in. And yes, it does give us a much higher yield and allows us to continue to expand our tenant relationships. And in fact, that's how we were able to get Starbucks as one of our tenants. So that is a program that we like. It's a small program today but it's one that we will continue to build on going forward.
Shivani Sood: Thanks for the time.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rob Stevenson with Janney. Your line is open.
Rob Stevenson: Good afternoon, guys. So are you guys looking at any non-U.K., European acquisitions these days? And how is your staffing over there going? And sort of what your sort of funnel look like outside of the U.S. these days?
Sumit Roy: So thanks for the question, Rob. Most of what we are looking at currently is all in the U.K. Yes we have sourced in the -- sourcing number that we shared with you the $6 billion. Some of it was in mainland Europe, but it was primarily driven by sourcing in the U.K. We are continuing to focus on stabilizing and creating a flow business that we can lean on in the U.K. That is our priority one. But that's not to say that for the right opportunity, we wouldn't consider moving to Western Europe. But that is not the focus currently. With regards to the team and setting up an office et cetera, we are very close to making that happen. I think I've mentioned this in one of my previous calls we have one of our veteran acquisition officers moving to the U.K. potentially later this month but certainly by December. And we are also in the midst of supplementing that team with somebody from the local markets that we are very excited about. And that will be the seeding of that particular office going forward. And I think I've mentioned this as well that some of the support functions have been outsourced. And over time when we have built a portfolio that can justify bringing in some of these outsourced support functions we will then grow the team to accommodate that as well.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. And then Paul what's keeping you from an A rating at Fitch? I mean, you've been A at Moody's for a while and even S&P upgraded you more than a year ago now. What are they telling you the sort of reason why you're still sort of -- if the word can be termed languishing BBB+?
Paul Meurer: I'm smiling a bit Rob. We agree with your analysis. We think we're well deserving of an upgrade there and certainly have shared with them significant data to show that on a comparable basis versus other A-rated REITs out there, et cetera that our metrics not only support that, but also demonstrates stability through different economic cycles, et cetera. So we also are a bit perplexed as to where we stand. They do their homework and give a review, but just haven't been ready to kind of move it up to the next level. And we think that it would be appropriate for them to continue that review and hopefully reach that more positive conclusion soon.
Rob Stevenson: Would the upgrade there have any practical impact on you guys? Or is it more of at this point just a marketing positive?
Paul Meurer: Our understanding is at this moment in the market, no. It really doesn't inhibit us in any way at this point nor would it make a market difference to have that additional rating with them.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys.
Paul Meurer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Linda Tsai: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. When you look at the investment spreads for domestic and international transactions would you expect these ranges to largely hold in the upcoming quarters? I mean, I realize it has likely to do with the mix of what you're buying, but what are some inputs to consider in terms of potential movements?
Sumit Roy: Well, there are two things that you obviously need to focus on in order to determine what the spread is. One is the cap rates. And as you've pointed out and I think I've said in my prepared remarks that the cap rates for the assets that we are interested in the U.K. tend to be in the high 4s to the mid 5% range. And then the question becomes, okay, how do we go about financing that particular acquisition. And that's where our cost of capital advantages really come to the 4%. Our weighted average nominal cost of capital in the U.K. today is right around the 2.8%. And so even a 4.7% is a very healthy 190 basis points of spread. And clearly on the U.S. side, our cost of capital is higher. It's closer to 3.7% today 3.8%. And -- but we are able to then buy assets at a higher blended cap rate. And so the spreads are being quite advantageous there as well. So once you sort of take into account where the cap rates are in the cost of capital, I think the spreads will -- it just so happens that this particular quarter, it's being essentially the same. I think it was 10% less spread in the U.K. or -- versus what we had in the U.S. But that I wouldn't say is the norm going forward. There are quarters -- it's quite possible that in the U.K. we may be able to do even better. But if you have to think about a trend line, I wouldn't forecast one geography necessarily having a superior spread to the other.
Linda Tsai: Thanks for that. And then given you've deleveraged to about five times in 3Q, would this be a reasonable expectation to maintain going forward?
Sumit Roy: I think what we have publicly said and what we have shared with the rating agencies is that we want the flexibility to run our business at a 5.5 times plus minus. And that's the right ZIP Code for us. The fact that it is five today is largely being driven by the over funding that we spoke about given the pipeline that we have visibility into. So I wouldn't necessarily say that five is the new norm. I would just say that it will fluctuate, but 5.5 is where you should expect us to operate in the balance sheet.
Linda Tsai: Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: Hi thanks. Just looking at Walgreens the stock is reacting well today just on speculation that it's in talks to go private. And not that I'm asking you to comment on this but maybe just a couple questions around your Walgreens exposure just as a reminder these individual leases any master leases. That's part one. And then part two when you look at a public tenant maybe in your past going private, how do you kind of look at that risk and maybe just some context around that? Thanks.
Sumit Roy: Sure Todd. It's a very good question. Yes, we have seen the rumors as well real-time or breaking news if that is truly accurate. And look in the past when we have seen smaller operators go private, cash flowing businesses that go private, and especially, if it's going private using the private equity route, that has tended to change the leverage profile of the business. The good news here is you're talking about a company that is approximately $70 billion in enterprise value with an equity market cap of about $55 billion, $60 billion if I remember correctly. So, the reasons for it to go private if that is true would need to be a lot more strategic. And -- so we feel pretty good. Look we've said that the entire delivery of healthcare is an area that is going through massive changes. But what we are very excited about is the fact that we own the brick-and-mortar. And any solution -- and that's our thesis and our belief is that any solution which is going to lead to more efficiency in the delivery of health care is going to require a brick-and-mortar network. And so -- and I don't want to start speculating as to who the potential buyers if there's any truth to that, but I think whatever happens, there's going to be some story around that as -- like why is it that as a private company or as a combined company with somebody else, et cetera the value proposition is even better? If that's not the case, I don't think that there would be rumors about it going private. So, we would still be very comfortable. With regards to whether we have master leases, we don't. But I just want to remind you that most of the Walgreens that we have in our portfolio came through sale-leaseback directly with Walgreens. And so these are institutional quality leases with growth et cetera and I think our weighted average lease term on the Walgreens is right around 10 years. So, we are very comfortable regardless of which direction this news ends up going.
Todd Stender: Okay. Thanks for that.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.
John Massocca: Good afternoon.
Sumit Roy: Hi John.
Sumit Roy: So, with regards to the CMFT transaction, is any portion of that portfolio potentially not a good long-term fit within your portfolio? And if so, how might that impact 2020 disposition activity? Understanding you're probably not going to give 2020 guidance, but just any commentary there would be helpful.
Sumit Roy: Sure. And so I think when we first announced this particular transaction, we spoke about -- this is a $1.25 billion transaction. We expect the vast majority of it to close later this year. And we also said that about $200 million of this particular portfolio are assets that we wouldn't have pursued in the one-off market. And so -- but that does not necessarily mean that all of the $200 million that we have acquired are going to be disposed of day one. In some cases, the economic argument would be that we hold on to the assets, collect the rents for the duration of the remaining lease term, and then given the location, given the below-market rents, whatever the dynamics are that it might actually be better for us to hold on to it and try to re-tenant it. Or it could also imply holding on to the assets until the end of their initial lease term and then selling it. So, -- and then there's a small bucket of that $200 million that we are absolutely going to come out with in 2020. And when we come out with our guidance in February, we will share that information with you.
John Massocca: Okay. That makes sense. And then, looking kind of at the existing debt stack, you've seen some of your peers kind of prepay some higher coupon debt. I mean does that make sense potentially for you guys going forward?
Paul Meurer: It very well could. We did a fair amount of that refinancing activity over the past 24 months, if you will. And some of that we already kind of took care of. But it is fair to say that they're still a little bit there that we're taking a look at. And as we get closer, obviously, it becomes cheaper to do so. And it is something that we're taking a look at.
John Massocca: Okay. That’s it for me. Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Collin Mings with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Collin Mings: Hey, good afternoon.
Paul Meurer: Hi. Collin. How are you?
Collin Mings: Doing well, doing well. I just want to pick up a bit on John's question, just as it relates to the CIM deal and maybe more broadly your ability to execute on larger portfolio deals. Can you maybe just update us on if you believe there's a portfolio discount available in the market right now, and just maybe talk a little bit more about that opportunity?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. Look, I think variants of this question have been asked in previous calls. And at least over the last couple of years, I would say, that we believe that there has been a decided discount when we pursue portfolio transactions. And we've seen this in the sale leaseback market. We've seen this even in the U.K. When we are able to come in and write big checks $0.5 billion, $1 billion, et cetera, we do get some form of discounts. And so, I don't want to speak specifically to the CIM portfolio. But largely speaking, we have seen portfolio discounts. And those portfolio discounts could range anywhere between 25 to 75 to even 100 basis points, if you compare it to the one-off 1,031 market. And that is one of the advantages of having size and scale.
Collin Mings: And I guess to that point to your comments that you've highlighted and talked about this dynamic before, do you feel like that gap is widening or narrowing? Or can you speak to that at all? Or does it just really vary deal to deal as you look across the marketplace?
Sumit Roy: I think it's the latter, Collin. I can't tell you that on every portfolio you have x basis points of discounts, and that remains constant regardless of the tenant regardless of the market environment. What I can tell you is we do see a discount, but the amount of the discount will certainly vary. And we've seen that on multiple sale leasebacks that we've done with the same tenant, in fact, where given market conditions, they're willing to accommodate us given our movements and cost of capital. And then, when things improve we accommodate them. So, it's not one fixed number, but it is a discount.
Collin Mings: Okay. And then, just one last one for me. Just more directly, can you maybe touch on the drop quarter-over-quarter in the Circle K exposure?
Sumit Roy: That probably has to do with rollovers. I think we've had a couple of Circle K rollovers, one of which we got back. And there was another one where we actually entered into a very long-term lease, and we invested the capital to expand the space, because they want to expand their convenience store. So, it really is a function of just what is precisely happening. I don't really know what the movement was, but I do remember seeing a couple of these and the investment committee. And so, in certain cases we've invested more and in others we've got back vacant assets.
Collin Mings: Got it. Thank you very much.
Sumit Roy: Sure, Collin.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for closing remarks.
Sumit Roy: So thank you all for joining us today, and we're looking forward to seeing everyone at NAREIT. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-08-06 14:30:00) =====
Andrew Crum: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's second quarter 2019 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference, we will make statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. We are pleased to complete another solid quarter on a very solid first half of 2019. During the quarter, we invested approximately 1.1 billion in high quality real estate at investment spreads well above our historical average. Which brings us to $1.6 billion invested during the first half of the year. Of the 1.1 billion invested during the quarter, $549 million or approximately 434 million British pounds was invested in the United Kingdom through a sale leaseback transaction with Sainsbury's. We plan to continue to grow our international platform as we are well positioned to capitalize on a significant addressable market in the UK, and mainland Europe. Given our portable size, scale, and cost of capital advantages, we believe we have a unique ability to execute sizable portfolio transactions with best in class operators. We look forward to further developing relationships with other industry leaders like Sainsbury's, as we expand our international platform. To finance our robust investment activity. We raised $1.9 billion of attractively priced capital during the quarter, including $1 billion of equity. We entered the second half of 2019 very well positioned with virtually full availability on our $3 billion line and a debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.4 times. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property ties, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased 265 commercial tenants in 49 different industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico, and the UK. 82.5% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial property at nearly 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.8% of rental revenue. Convenience Store remains our largest industry at 11.9% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, non-discretionary, and our low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent US retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to feel good about the credit quality in the portfolio with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio or our retail properties is 2.8 times on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list at 1.65% of rent is relatively consistent with our levels of the last few years. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, flat versus the prior quarter. We continue to expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2019. During the quarter, we re-leased 86 properties recapturing 100.4% of the expiring rent. During the first half of 2019, we re-leased 157 properties, recapturing 102.2% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,000 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Our same-store rental revenue increased 1.4% during the quarter and 1.5% for the first half of the year. Our projected runway for 2019 continues to be approximately 1%. Approximately 86% of our leases have contractual rent increases. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results.
Paul Meurer: Thanks Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursements, was 5.3% for the quarter and 4.9% year to date, both of which were below comparable year-ago periods. Consistent with prior years, G&A tends to be slightly higher in the first half of the year due to the timing of stock vesting and costs associated with our annual meeting and proxy. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and expect our G&A margin to remain below 5% in 2019. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursements, was 1.4% for the quarter and 1.3% year to date, which is better than our full-year expectation in a 1.5% to 1.75% range. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was 82 cents per share for the quarter, which represents a 2.5% increase Briefly turning to the balance sheet and we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure, and we remain one of only a few REITs with at least AA ratings. As Sumit mentioned during the second quarter, we raised approximately $1.9 billion of favorable price long-term capital to fund our acquisition activity. In May, we issued 315 million of sterling denominated 15-year senior unsecured notes via private placement at a yield of 2.73%. Proceeds from the offering allowed us to partially finance the acquisition of the Sainsbury's portfolio in the UK. We were pleased with the pricing and high quality order book for our first ever private offering. And we very much appreciate the support of the investors who participated. The sterling denominated offering allowed us to finance the Sainsbury's transaction with a natural currency hedge, while taking advantage of low interest rates abroad. In June, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at a yield of 3.33%. The offering allowed us to term out borrowing on our revolving credit facility and the bonds fit nicely in our debt maturity schedule as we have no other maturities in 2029. During the second quarter, we issued approximately $1 billion of common equity through a combination of overnight and ATM offerings. And thus we finished the quarter with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.4 times and virtually full availability of our $3 billion revolver. Our fixed-charge coverage remains healthy at 4.4 times, and the weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 8.8 years, which closely tracks our weighted average remaining lease term. Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with only $18 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year, and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter with just over $300 million of debt, maturing in both 2020 and 2021. So, in summary, our balance sheets in great shape, we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics, and excellent liquidity. And now, let me turn the call back over to Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Paul. During the second quarter of 2019, we invested approximately 1.1 billion in 102 properties located in 28 states and the United Kingdom at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. On a total revenue basis, approximately 12% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants, 99% of their revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 15 industries. Some of the more significant industries represented our UK grocery stores, theaters, and automotive services. We closed 20 discrete transactions in the second quarter, and approximately 86% of second quarter investment volume was sale leaseback transactions. Of the 1.1 billion invested during the quarter, $546 million was invested domestically in 90 properties at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.9% and with weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. International investments during the quarter were $549 million or approximately 434 million pounds in 12 properties as at average initial cash cap rate of 5.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. All 12 International properties are leased to Sainsbury's, a top grocer in the UK. Year-to-date 2019, we invested 1.6 billion US dollars in 199 properties located in 34 states and the United Kingdom at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.6 years. On a revenue basis, 80% [ph] of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 99% of the revenues are generated from retail and 1% are from industrial. Of the 45 independent transactions closed year-to-date, four transactions were above 50 million US. Approximately 74% of our year-to-date investment volume was sale leaseback transactions. Of the $1.6 billion invested year-to-date, nearly $1.1 billion was invested domestically in 187 properties at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.8% and with a weighted average lease term 15.9 years. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy, as we sourced approximately $19.1 billion in the second quarter. Investment-grade opportunities represented 29% of the volume sourced for the second quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 34% were portfolios and 66% or approximately 12.6 billion were one-off assets. Of the $19.1 billion sourced during the quarter, $15.9 billion were domestic opportunities and $3.2 billion were international opportunities. Year-to-date 2019, we have sourced approximately $30.8 billion in potential transactions. Of these opportunities, 41% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 59% or approximately $18 billion were one-off assets. Of the $1.1 billion in total acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 13% of the volume was one-off transactions. As to pricing, cap rates in the US were essentially unchanged in the second quarter. Investment-grade properties are trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties are trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Regarding cap rates in the United Kingdom for the types of assets we are targeting, investment-grade or implied investment-grade properties are trading from the low 4% to mid 5% cap rate range. Non-investment-grade properties are trading from 5% to low 7% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 290 basis points for domestic investments and 209 basis points for international investments, both of which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less a nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our invested pipeline remains robust. And we remain the only publicly-traded net lease company that has the size, scale, and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. Based on our robust investment pipeline, we continue to expect 2019 acquisition guidance at $2 billion to $2.5 billion Our disposition program remains active. During the quarter, we sold 18 properties for net proceeds of $28.6 million at net cash cap rate of 7.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.9%. This brings us to 36 properties sold year-to-date for $50 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 6.8%. We continue to improve the quality of our portfolio through the sale of non-strategic assets, recycling the sale proceeds into properties that benefit our investment parameters. We anticipate between 75 million and 100 million of dispositions in 2019. In June, we increased the dividend for the 102nd time in our company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents an approximately 3% increase over the year-ago period and equates to a payout ratio of 82.2% based on the midpoint of 2019 AFFO guidance. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994. growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.6%. We are proud to be one of only five REITs in S&P high-yield dividend aristocrats index. To wrap it up, we completed another strong quarter. Our portfolio continues to perform well. Our investment pipeline remains strong, and we are well positioned to pursue new opportunities for growth both domestically and internationally. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Looks like our first question will come from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.
Greg McGinniss: This is Greg McGinniss on for Nick. Sumit, based on some prior commentary, it seemed like acquisition -- an acquisition guidance range was possibly on the table for this year. How are you thinking about acquisition range today? Has the environment -- investment environment become more competitive with lower interest rates? And any color would be appreciated there.
Sumit Roy: Sure. As of today, we have obviously reaffirmed our acquisition guidance. If you look at the sourcing we've done year-to-date, it is at historic levels, especially if you just focus on the domestic side. We've done 27 billion US dollars of domestic sourcing, and it's through the end of June, which on a run rate basis is going to be far beyond the high 30 million that we have sourced historically. Yes, the market is competitive, but the cost of capital allows us to continue to win our share of deals, and we feel very comfortable about the pipeline that we have today and about the guidance range that we have shared with you.
Greg McGinniss: Okay. And just following up on some other guidance items. Paul, as you noted with your opening comments, property expenses have been lower than the full year range. On the opposite side, same-store rent growth have been higher. Should we take that to mean that there's going to be some slowdown in the back half of the year? Or how should we interpret first half results versus full year guidance?
Paul Meurer: No, I think both of those are running favorably. And we would probably lean towards both of those doing -- doing well the remainder of the year but not such that we thought it was prudent to make a specific change in that guidance at this time. But I certainly wouldn't -- wouldn't think of a downturn in either of those areas to normalize back at where our guidance is. We've been pleased with the same-store rent growth this year, partly related to just the timing of contractual rent bumps this year. But in addition, with property expenses running lower, we suspect both of those trends will continue through the remainder of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Christy McElroy with Citi.
Katy McConnell: Good morning, this is Katy McConnell on for Christy. Can you provide some color on the types of international deals that you're looking at or underwriting today? And how are you thinking about the rest of the year, as far as the mix between deals that you could potentially do in the US versus abroad?
Sumit Roy: The vast majority of the deals that we're going to be doing will be US focused, you know, and I touched -- to the previous person, I'd answer the question with regards to why we feel so optimistic about you know, the -- the deal flow here in the US, it's -- it's -- it has been at historical levels. With respect to the UK, we continue to see transactions and the volume that we have seen has exceeded our original underwriting. I'm not in a position today to tell you precisely the transactions we're going to be, you know, getting over the finish line. But suffice it to say that it wouldn't be, you know, out of the realm of possibility to do a few more transactions in the UK.  You know, our goal when we first did the Sainsbury sale leaseback was to establish our footprint in the UK, to make sure that we had our processes in place. And having closed this transaction, closed the books in the second quarter with the financials, we feel very good about where we stand today. [Technical Difficulty] resourced in the UK, like I said was above [indiscernible] range is right around $2.5 billion, that's $900 million delta from where we are today. I would say the vast majority will still be US focused, but some of it will certainly be from the UK.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.
Kevin Egan: Hi, this is Kevin on for Vikram. Just a quick question for me. I know that the original underwriting of the Sainsbury transaction, I believe it was $1.30 what was going to be represented to be a British pound. I know now it's about $1.22, I know the vast majority of the 85% is hedged, but in terms of the remaining 15%, is there anything there that we should be thinking about?
Sumit Roy: No, because if you recall, the way we structured the transaction, the entire principal balance was 100% hedged and 85% of the cash flows that we are generating on an annual basis is also hedged. And keep in mind that, you know, off the financing, only 30% of the financing was equity based. We finance 70% of the transaction using domestic GDP denominated debt. So we feel very comfortable that, you know, the volatility that you see in the currency market has next to not zero but very, very limited impact on our cash flow statement. And the 15% that remains on hedge we are going to continue to keep it in the UK. And you know, you heard my previous answer. We have seen plenty of deals flow to be able to invest, reinvest those proceeds. So, you know, the volatility is going to have very little impact and zero cash flow impact.
Kevin Egan: Okay, so is it safe to assume then that the remaining 15% it's not hedged? Basically, just it is not repatriated [indiscernible] [00:21:49] going forward, you think?
Sumit Roy: Absolutely. That is absolutely going to be our strategy going forward.
Kevin Egan: Okay, and then just one last for me, I noticed there was a slight uptick in impairment, I think it was impairment charge of about 13 million. Can you give us any color on what that was about?
Paul Meurer: You'll see a few more impairments when you think about how much larger our company has gotten size of company, size of the asset, base, etc. So you'll -- you'll -- you'll have a little bit larger number there. But it's also related to what I would describe as more aggressive asset management approach on our part, to work through assets much more quickly, to the extent that we don't see a releasable opportunity or a -- an opportunity for redevelopment that we will, you know, sell something a little quicker, maybe then we wouldn't have passed and redeploy that capital. So kind of along those lines. Obviously, it's a non-cash impact to the company. And just one statistic to kind of give it some materiality context. And since 2012, it's only represented about 0.1% of our gross book value. So it's really not a significant issue for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Rob Stevenson with Janney Capital.
Rob Stevenson: Good afternoon, guys. Given the robust pricing on several industrial deals over the last few months and the amount of capital chasing those deals, have you guys thought about selling either part or all the industrial portfolio and redeploying that capital into higher yielding retail assets, given where your yields are on domestic retail?
Sumit Roy: We decided to go down this path of diversifying across asset types in 2010. It has held us in very good stead. Despite some of the, you know, higher cap rates you have on the retail side, I can tell you that some of the opportunities that we've been able to uncover on the industrial side has created tremendous value for the company. And, in fact, you know, a lot of which you see coming through what our asset management team is currently being doing. So, you know, our long term, you know, and we believe that the long-term value creation is -- is not necessarily going to be driven by trying to time markets and maximize IRRs. We believe we can maximize IRRs playing the long game. And as long as we hold the right industrial assets with the right tenants in the right markets, we will create similar if not superior value for the company. So, yes, we could -- we could sell a -- you know, our -- our entire industrial portfolio at incredibly aggressive cap rates, but that is not really our business strategy. 
Rob Stevenson: Okay, and then looking to Europe, main, how much of what you're looking at today and tomorrow are going to wind up being office industrial versus traditional retail. And are you guys going to need this to take up headcount over there and pick up G&A to accomplish what you want to get to?
Sumit Roy: I’ll answer the last bit first. My focus has been to bring down our G&A from the run rate that you have seen in the company over the last couple of years, which has been right around 5%. And our goal for 2019 is to make sure that it is below 5%. So regardless of what we do, in terms of, you know, being able to right size the -- the team in the UK, to help manage UK and the rest of Europe, that is not going to change that objective for the company will not change. You are absolutely right that we are in the process of building out the team in the UK, I think I've already spoken about having one of our acquisition team members, a senior acquisition team member move to the UK to basically see the office there. And we are in the process of supplementing that team with one additional person, that's going to be the scope initially. And the rest of the servicing, such as on the accounting side, etc. We felt like an outsourced model, at least today, is far better and more cost effective strategy than to sort of bring that in house. But the goal is there is going to be an inflection point, and that is going to be dictated by the assets that we continue to buy and the portfolio that we build. And where it makes sense, we will bring those functions in house. But the goal is not to do that day -- day one. It's to do it over time and let the portfolio dictate when that's going to occur.
Rob Stevenson: And then the -- the question about the mix in terms of Europe, in terms of retail versus office industrial? Are you targeting office industrial over there now?
Sumit Roy: Yeah, sorry, it's old age, forgetting parts of questions. Look, we've always said that we are predominantly a retail oriented company and we love the industrial product. Lon-term leases with tenants that we want to do business with. Those are primarily going to be the two asset types that we're going to continue to pursue. I'm not going to say no office. But office we have stated very clearly and unequivocally that here in the US, investing in office has not been a core strategy of ours. And, in fact, over time, our portfolio for office assets has dwindled. And so, I don't believe that that will change just because the geography has changed.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brian Hawthorne with RBC Capital Markets.
Brian Hawthorne: Hi, how does the volatile currency fluctuations impact your ability to make acquisitions? Is there a certain level that -- that starts to either slow or help you guys out?
Sumit Roy: Well, the trend that it's going certainly helps us. You know, the pound continues to depreciate vis-à-vis the dollar. And, you know, the value creation opportunities just continues to accrue to us. The question is, you know, what's the long game, but today, as long as your view on the tail risk of Brexit is not draconian and some of that gets mitigated by where you invest, i.e. non-discretionary operators, then I think, you know, and this is our -- our house view that it is a very propitious environment for us to continue to invest and create tremendous value for our shareholders. So, the current environment actually is, unfortunately, it's tough to say that, but from an economic perspective, it's the right environment for us to be investing in because we do have unprecedented spreads that we can sort of realize for our investments.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.
John Massocca: Good afternoon, and good morning still in San Diego.
Sumit Roy: Good afternoon.
John Massocca: Just about. Yeah. Were all of the $3.2 billion of international transactions sourced in the quarter in the UK or any of the transactions in Western Europe?
Sumit Roy: Yeah, predominantly the UK, there was one transaction we saw in Spain, but the vast majority of that $3.2 billion was UK.
John Massocca: Okay and then could you maybe provide some color on the increase exposure to the theater industry and Regal in particular and if it was one individual transaction, what was the rough size of the transaction and what kind of maybe was the impact that had on your reported domestic acquisition cap rate?
Sumit Roy: I'll answer that last piece first. By and large theater transactions occur in the low to mid 7% cap rate range. So you can assume comfortably that this particular sale leaseback that we did was in that range. So, this was a sale leaseback that's Sinovel ran, and we were very comfortable with the 17 assets that we looked at. We looked at their profitability per screen, their sales per screen. We looked at the demos and this was right down the fairway for us in terms of what are the qualities that we look for in theater assets, and so the size of this was roughly $280 million, $290 million and like I said, these are precisely the type of assets that that we would have gone out and picked off on a one-off basis. But having it delivered to us as a portfolio by Cinema World. It was something that we really liked and we felt like it was priced appropriately and we were very happy with the transaction. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: Thanks. And just to stay on the Regal, any specifics on the lease, maybe the term? And then any annual escalators tucked in there?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. I believe these were 15-year leases. We had annual escalators. We don't want to make it a precedent talk to talk about specific transactions, but you can assume that the cash flow coverages were not of where we typically see these assets. These were 15-year leases with annual growth and on pretty much all of the metrics that you would want to measure theaters, this was either at or superseding our hurdle rate and so right down the fairway really.
Todd Stender: Okay Pretty clean. Thanks, Sumit. And then Paul you did the debut offering. I guess the private placement on the UK at 15 years, but you've got the A-rating here. Is it-- to do the private placement, is that would you do first? Is there an order of operations and then the next offering is the public bond, you just have to grease the wheels, so to speak with investors over there? What would be teed up next?
Paul Meurer: Yeah, I mean, not necessarily. So what we did was we wanted to create a natural currency hedge. So we wanted to do predominantly debt financing for that purpose. And we looked at all the alternatives, whether that be a public bond offering, a private placement offering, mortgage debt and the private placement offering was the one that was most favorable in terms of the depth of that market, the size of what we could do, the flexibility with the maturity and then of course the pricing was excellent. And what was fascinating was, it was really the same investors that we know real, real well. US life insurance companies that we have a terrific relationship with on the unsecured public bond side here in the US and essentially we were talking to those same shops. So we were kind of an improved credit with them. They were again quite amenable to a maturity length that we wanted, which was the 15 year. We wanted to do that to match more so the lease length of course. And the depth of that market we uncovered is quite significant. Longer term, could we consider public bond offering there entering that market in that fashion. That certainly feels like something we'd want to explore. I think we'd want to probably build up a little bit more of a local brand and commitment to the market before making that decision. But in the meantime, there is plenty of depth in the private placement side, the pricing is excellent and we’re real pleased with how that went.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.
Chris Lucas: Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Just a quick one. Paul, you had noted that the same growth profile was impacted by, I guess, some timing on rent bumps. I guess just thinking about this over the longer haul, is the 1.5% rate that you guys are -- seem to be running at this year, is this something that we can expect going forward? Or is this more of an anomaly within the sort of more traditional 1% bump rate that you guys have generated historically?
Sumit Roy: Yeah, Paul's been kind in letting me answer that question, Chris. So forgive me. You know what happened in the second quarter and this is very straightforward. Quite a few of our leases don't have annual growth built into them. They have step growth, which could be every three years, every five years and that's typically how some of the leases are structured. And what we noticed in the second quarter was that of all -- if you were to compare it to second quarter of 2018, there were 15% more leases that had this step growth that just coincidentally happened to fall in the second quarter, which is what resulted in that 1.5%. And so now that they've had that growth in the second quarter of 2019, you're not going to see that the following year. And that's the reason why we continue to believe that, this year, yes, is it possible that it is slightly not at 1%? Yes, but our run rate within our portfolio, we have always said is right around 1%. And that's -- that continues to be the case.
Chris Lucas: Okay, great. Thank you, Sumit. And then I guess while I have you, on the portfolio pricing of the theaters, I guess, just more generally, your cap rates first quarter were sort of better than last year’s. Certainly, the domestic cap rates this quarter were better than sort of last year's average, rates are down relative to last year. I guess, I'm just wondering, sort of, is it just purely just sort of the mix issue that you're dealing with this year versus last year? Or is there some value to portfolio pricing that you're seeing that maybe is being more predominant this year versus last year? I'm just trying to kind of get a understanding between last year’s results and this year’s?
Sumit Roy: Sure. Very good question, Chris. We don't see too much of a movement in the portfolio discount that we saw last year versus this year. The reason why you see higher cap rates, it's predominantly a question around the mix of assets, the type of tenants, the type of properties that we've been buying. As we've talked about the theater assets, they tend to be higher cap rate assets, some of the other assets that we've closed on, they just tend to have higher yields on the high-6s, low-7s, mid-7s in some cases. I think that has predominantly driven our overall cap rate than seeing shifts in cap rate. Having said that, we're certainly seeing intra property like within certain sub sectors in retail, cap rates have moved, and in some cases, they've gotten more aggressive, as you would expect, given the current environment. And in some cases, they've remained flat. But by and large, the opening remarks that I've made around cap rates remaining somewhat steady is true for us, despite the fact that you're seeing us amplify cap rates that are higher on what we have closed. But that's predominantly driven by the mix.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.
Caitlin Burrows: Maybe just following up on that last question. You're talking about how the certain mix of assets has impacted your cap rates so far this year on acquisitions. I guess going forward, do you expect to continue that potentially Numix called it or do you think you could go back to what you've done more historically?
Sumit Roy: Caitlin, we always like higher cap rates, but it needs to fit our investment thesis. And like I answered Chris's question, it just so happened that everything aligned and the mix that we're looking for, the opportunities that we saw that fit our transaction -- our acquisition criteria, it just happened to trade at higher cap rates. I'd love to be able to tell you that we’ve continued to see that same mix and we'll be able to continue to post high 6% cap rates and therefore create more value, but some of it is driven by the opportunities available in the market. And so I wouldn't necessarily count on that. But we are not averse to continuing to do transactions, just because it has a higher yield, as long as it fits our investment philosophy.
Caitlin Burrows: And then maybe just on the volume or deal flow side. I know, you mentioned earlier that you were seeing historical, very high levels of domestic deal flow. So just wondering, is there anything you can think of that's driving that, in particular, and do you expect that activity levels to continue?
Sumit Roy: I do think, even if we were to sort of normalize over the next six months, this year could turn out to be one of the highest year that, not the highest year in terms of sourcing, some of our sourcing is of course, going to get supplemented by what we are seeing in the UK as well, which we haven't had in years past. But, do I see a particular trend in the market? No, that I can point to that sort of answers as to why we're seeing this unprecedented volume of sourcing. It just happens to be the case. We know that there are larger portfolios that have come to market, there are a lot of opco, propco situations that we find ourselves discussing with potential operators on. So it's, for whatever reason we find ourselves at a point with the cost of capital and the scale to be able to act on it, so we are very excited about it. But I can't really point to any one variable that is causing this phenomena, it's just, it is what we see and we're very excited about it.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer portion of the Realty Income conference call. I would now like to turn the call back to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Carry. Thank you all for joining us today. I hope everyone continues to enjoy the rest of the summer. And we look forward to seeing everyone at the upcoming conferences. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-03 14:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Realty Income First Quarter 2019 Operating Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Crum, Senior Associate, Realty Income. Please go ahead sir.
Andrew Crum: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's first quarter 2019 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Andrew. Welcome to our call today. We are pleased to begin 2019 with another successful quarter. During the quarter we invested approximately $520 million in high-quality real estate and investment spread, well above our historical average and we continue to see ample transaction flow that meets our investment parameters. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced our international expansion through a GBP429 million sale leaseback transaction in the UK with Sainsbury's under long-term triple-net leases. This represents a natural evolution of our Company's strategy and we will continue to grow our international platform as we are well-positioned to capitalize on a significant addressable market in the UK and mainland Europe. From a strategic standpoint, we believe there is a dearth of large institutional buyers pursuing the quality of single tenant net leased assets in Europe that we intend to invest in. Given our portable size, scale and cost of capital advantages, we believe we have a unique ability to execute sizable portfolio transactions with best-in-class operators. This transaction was relationship-driven and was completed on an off-market negotiated basis. We look forward to further developing relationships with other industry leaders like Sainsbury's as we expand our international platform. Concurrent with the announcement of our sale leaseback transaction with Sainsbury's, we increased our 2019 AFFO per share guidance to a range of $3.28 to $3.33 from a prior range of $3.25 to $3.31 and we increased our 2019 acquisition guidance to a range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased to 261 commercial tenants in 48 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 82% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at nearly 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.1% of rental revenue. Convenience store remains our largest industry at 12.2% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.8 times on a four-wall basis while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list at 1.6% of rent is relatively consistent with our levels over the first few years. Occupancy, based on the number of properties, was 98.3%, a decrease of 30 basis points versus a year ago period. We expect occupancy to be approximately 98% in 2019. During the quarter we released 71 properties, recapturing approximately 105% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold over 2,900 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. Our same-store rental revenue increased 1.5% during the quarter. Our projected run rate for 2019 continues to be circa 1%. Approximately 86% of our leases have contractual rent increases. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Effective in the first quarter we adopted the new lease accounting guidance. And as a result we are now consolidating tenant reimbursement revenue within rental revenue in our income statement. To aid financial statement users we will continue to separately disclose the component of revenue attributable to reimbursable tenant expenses in both our 10-Q and in our financial supplement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursement, was 4.5% for the quarter, below our G&A expenses in the year-ago quarter from both a margin basis and a dollar basis. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and expect our G&A margin to remain below 5% in 2019. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of revenue, excluding reimbursements, was 1.3% for the quarter which also remains ahead of our full year expectation in the 1.5% to 1.75% range. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.82 per share for the quarter, which represents a 3.8% increase. Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and of course we remain one of only a few REITs with at least AA rating. During the first quarter we issued $2.2 million of common equity through our dividend reinvestment stock purchase plan. Note that we entered 2019 with a very low leverage after issuing almost $540 million of common equity in the fourth quarter of 2018. We finished this quarter with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.5 times and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.2 billion available on our credit line. Our fixed charge coverage ratio increased from 4.4 times to 4.5 times. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is approximately 8.5 years which closely tracks our weighted average remaining lease term. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, selling $19 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2019 and our maturity schedule is well-laddered thereafter with just over $300 million of debt maturing in both 2020 and 2021. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage ratios and excellent liquidity. Now let me turn the call back over to Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Paul. I'll now move to our investment activity during the quarter. During the first quarter of 2019 we invested approximately $520 million in 105 properties located in 25 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.7% and with a weighted average lease term of 17 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 31% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 98.7% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 25 different tenants in 14 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, automotive services and grocery stores. We closed 25 discrete transactions in the first quarter. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy as we sourced approximately $11.7 billion in the first quarter. Investment-grade opportunities represented 31% of the volume sourced for the first quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during first quarter, 53% were portfolios and 47% or approximately $5.0 billion were one-off assets. Of the $519 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 42% of the volume were one-off transactions. As to pricing, cap rates have essentially remained unchanged in the first quarter. Investment-grade properties are trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties are trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging approximately 261 basis points in the first quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our domestic investment pipeline remains robust and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain the only publicly traded net lease company that has the size, scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale-leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. During the first quarter approximately 50% of our acquisitions were sale leaseback transactions and we continue to identify strong corporate partners for future sale-leaseback transactions. As previously mentioned, due to the strength in our current domestic investment pipeline as well as our international expansion, we have raised 2019 acquisition guidance to a range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Our disposition program remains active. During the quarter we sold 18 properties for net proceeds of $21.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 9.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 5.4%. The low IRR on our disposition activity during the quarter was primarily driven by one sale of vacant property previously leased to a sporting-goods retailer. Absent this disposition, our IRR on dispositions during the quarter was 7.2%. We continue to improve the quality of our portfolio through the sale of non-strategic assets, recycling the sale proceeds into properties that better fit our investment parameters. We continue to anticipate between $75 million and $100 million dispositions in 2019. In March, we increased the dividend for the 101st time in our Company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 3% increase over the year-ago period and equates to a payout ratio of 82.1% based on the midpoint of 2019 AFFO guidance. We have increased our dividend every year since the Company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.6%. We are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. To wrap it up, we completed another strong quarter. Our portfolio continues to perform well. Our investment pipeline remains robust and we are excited about the Company's next chapter as we continue to pursue new opportunities for growth, both domestically and internationally. At this time I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Christy McElroy of Citi. Please go ahead.
Christy McElroy: Hi, good morning guys. So given that ATM issuance is pretty wide in Q1 relative to your normal pace, wondering if you were in a quiet period given the timing of the Sainsbury deal and would you expect it to pick up again now that the deal has been announced? And maybe have you issued any equity post the announcement?
Sumit Roy: Good question, Christy, and you're spot on. Because of the nature of the transaction with regards to Sainsbury's, we were in a blackout period. And so that was the primary reason. The second and equally important reason was in the fourth quarter we had overequitized our balance sheet in anticipation of this particular transaction. So even at the end of the quarter if you look at where the balance sheet is, it's 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA, north of 4.6 times coverage on a fixed charge basis. It leaves the balance sheet in a very good stand. So with regards to capital raising, all avenues are open to us and we will perpetually choose the best available avenue going forward. But those were the primary reasons.
Christy McElroy: Okay. And then just looking at the occupancy rate ticked down a bit, any main drivers of that that we should be thinking about and maybe comment on sort of what the outlook looks like for the rest of the year? I think you said 80 -- I'm sorry, 98%. But I wasn't sure if that was sort of a year-end number or an average number.
Sumit Roy: Yes. Again, good question. These two was anticipated which is why if you look at what we guided The Street and which is what's reflected in our earnings guidance, we had guided The Street to a 98% occupancy number. We had 101 leases expiring in the first quarter which was disproportionately high. And for the remaining three quarters we've got 158 leases expiring. So we anticipated that the 98% was going to come down. As we've always shared with the market that we believe our operational occupancy is right around that 2% ZIP Code. And so having an occupancy number at 98% is what we forecast and is what we believe we're going to be running our business at.
Christy McElroy: Okay. And then if I could, just one last quick one. Paul, I thought I heard you mention that you'll continue to disclose the revenue component breakout in the Q also. I'm just curious, will that be in the footnotes or the MD&A?
Paul Meurer: So you can see it right now by the way in the supplement so that you have it immediately.
Christy McElroy: Right. We have it in the supplement, yes. I'm just curious about what the -- in terms of the Q what the SEC and FASB guided to you in terms of allowing that in the Q?
Paul Meurer: It will be in our MD&A.
Christy McElroy: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.
Nick Yulico: Thanks. I guess I was just wondering in terms of, you know, when you look at the retail industry in the US, is your thinking evolved on drugstore exposure given what seems like a little tougher operating environment more -- are there any other industries where you might be making more or less of a capital investment based on some changes in the retail environment?
Sumit Roy: Good question, Nick. This is a question that we often get asked based on our exposure to the drugstore industry. It continues to be our second largest industry exposure. And it's primarily driven by two operators, Walgreens and CVS. And if you look at Walgreens, for instance, they're generating north of $5 billion in free cash flow. If you look at CVS, it's one of the best operators out there in the drugstore industry. We are very positive of the drugstore business. Is it going through some changes? Absolutely. But we feel, we believe that by and large these two operators are very well-positioned to take advantage of these changes that we see unfolding before our eyes. Some of which, the answers are not very clear, what does the drugstore layout of the future look like today? It's not very clear. But what it is clear is that both CVS as well as Walgreens have made it part of their strategy to figure out how to optimize their stores. If you look at the pharmacy same-store sales growth, they continue to comp positively, both for CVS as well as for Walgreens. And what they're trying to figure out is what to do with the remaining two-thirds of the footprint. And there are experiments under way as to how to optimize that. On the retail side on the front end, is it, should they be focusing more on beauty products? And that has much higher margin and that continues to be a sub segment that continues to do well. And the rest of the footprint, they are trying to figure out how to provide services. That was one of the genesis stated reasons as to why CVS and Aetna merged, is to how to we provide healthcare services, both for acute as well as chronic illnesses, using the footprint that is already available? Another piece that we had is being closer to the consumer, they believe, will be the best way to lower the cost of delivering healthcare. And not all of that has played out, but they're certainly experimenting with different formats et cetera. And we believe these are the two operators that will continue to do well and will figure it out eventually.
Nick Yulico: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just in terms of any sub-sectors within retail where you would like to have less exposure?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Look, casual dining continues to be an area that we focus on. It used to represent a very large portion of our portfolio 10 years ago. And today, it's right around 4%, sub-4%. And the ones that we are exposed to, by and large we're very happy with. But that's an area that we continue to be very cautious and an area that we continue to focus on very closely. Anything that falls in the discretionary bucket of retail from furniture stores to other types of discretionary product like sporting goods et cetera, those are again industries that we are very, very cautious in looking at and certainly trying to invest in. And then there are certain other asset types that are much more either demographically driven such as child care centers. We like the child care business, but the format of the 1980s which worked and have been cash flow positive for us and we've gone full cycle, but demographics have shifted in the neighborhoods where some of these concepts seem to have worked 20 years ago but don't seem to work today. Those are assets that we have on our watch list and are looking to dispose off, and at very good total return profiles. A similar story with regards to the format are the kiosk C-stores. We love the C-store business, but we like the 3000-plus square foot convenience store business. And the ones that have these kiosks that essentially sell lottery tickets and tobacco products are ones that we are actively trying to dispose off. So that's the area that I would say that we are either trying to minimize our exposure to or not invest in at all.
Nick Yulico: Thank you. Just one last question if I may. On the leasing activity page in the supplement you have where you give the recapture rate, could you give a little bit more detail on the four leases where you had essentially about a 30% markdown in rents? And it says it's without vacancies. So I guess I'm just wondering why if you had a tenant, why you released it at a lower rent?
Sumit Roy: Well, those are the ones where the tenant decided not to stay. And for us you're always looking at those assets and trying to come up with the economic scenario of selling those assets vacant or releasing it. And it is not atypical. If you go back and look at our supplemental, to have assets that have even with zero vacancy lease rates that are sub-100%, so the fact that this was right around 70% doesn't really drive the overall profile. We still came out at 105% recapture rate. And as you can see, it's largely driven by leases with tenants that choose to exercise the existing options. And for us that's really the crux of what we are trying to underwrite, it is to make sure that the retail product continues to be of relevance to the existing tenant because they exercise those options, those options tend to have growth in them and that is the best way for us to recapture a positive spread with almost always zero dollars of additional investment. But in situations when we have had vacancy or even with no vacancy, when you're trying to attract new tenants, sometimes taking a 30% drop in a recapture rate proves out or at least to our analysis proves it to be a much better economic outcome than trying to sell those assets vacant. And that's the story behind that.
Nick Yulico: Okay, appreciate it, thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: Our next question will come from Rob Stevenson of Janney. Please go ahead.
Rob Stevenson: Good afternoon guys. Just follow-up on Nick's question. So there's roughly 100 vacant assets in the portfolio. I mean what's the sort of mix between what you guys expect the retenant versus market for sale?
Sumit Roy: It's been roughly, if you look at it historically speaking, 80% of every lease that comes up for renewal gets exercised by the existing tenant. I would say 10% to 15% of the remaining leases we end up leasing to new tenants and 5% to 10% we end up selling. More recently that mix have shifted. We are tending to dispose off assets, vacant assets because we feel like the economic recapture rate is superior to going down the path of releasing it, and for Nick's question, releasing it at levels that don't make a lot of sense. And in some cases we are holding on to vacant assets and this is where some of our active asset management comes into play because we believe we can reposition those assets and actually recapture well north of the expiring rents. But that does take time and which is why we have said that our frictional vacancy rate is right around that 2% because we are more than happy holding on to these assets and repositioning them and potentially holding them for 18 months to two years because we believe that the economic outcome in those areas is superior to either retenanting it as it is or selling it vacant.
Rob Stevenson: Okay. What's your thoughts on adding casinos or hotel assets in the portfolio?
Sumit Roy: Good question. There are players in our space that are dedicated to pursuing casinos. We feel like they're very well suited to pursue that strategy. We obviously monitor the asset type, but we really don't have a thesis at this point as to whether we will do anything about entering into that front.
Rob Stevenson: And hotels as well?
Sumit Roy: Yes, I would put both of them in the same bucket.
Rob Stevenson: Okay, thanks guys.
Operator: Our next question will come from Collin Mings of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Collin Mings: Great, thank you. Last week you provide a lot of detail an the opportunity to grow in Europe, I guess, where you want to take your international platform. Where could Canada fit in? Are you evaluating any opportunities there as well?
Sumit Roy: We've always looked at Canada. We've looked at countries south of the border as well and we've not been able to pencil the economics. And then the product that is available in these alternative geographies haven't been the ones that we have wanted to pursue based on the economic profile. But look, I mean one of the main reasons why we wanted to provide all that detail, Collin, was to make sure that you understood the thesis behind why we chose to go into the UK and potentially into mainland Europe. And it's because the economics do pencil and in fact they pencil very well especially given the current environment and the product lends itself to what it is that we've been pursuing here in the US. And so this is truly the way we think about, you know, if you're going to change anything or if you're going to introduce any level of new paths for us to pursue, it needs to sort of be along the lines of what we have presented as to why we chose the same space of portfolio. And so this was a long and drawn out way of answering that, yes, Canada certainly is one of the countries that we have looked at in the past and if the right product with the right economic profile comes along, we will absolutely pursue it, but we haven't been able to find one yet.
Collin Mings: Okay. It doesn't sound like there's any bigger push now that you've established an international platform necessarily to go in that direction, is that fair?
Sumit Roy: It's now that we've done, more people are aware of the fact that we're open to doing it. So I would say that that's not entirely fair, Collin. We are certainly getting a lot more inbound calls as was expected and so transactions perhaps that we may not have seen because people weren't aware that we were a potential player in the past. That dynamic has changed. And, which was completely expected and the team here is ready to respond to those calls. So, time will tell.
Collin Mings: Great. That's actually very helpful clarification there. Just switching to investment activity during the quarter, there really weren't huge moves in your top tenant roster just on as far as the Dollar General property, obviously that was up somewhat notably. Maybe just take a second and kind of, if there's any additional color you can provide there and then talk about just Dollar Stores exposure overall at this point?
Sumit Roy: Yes. A lot of it was parts of small portfolios that we acquired. We continue to like Dollar Tree and Dollar General. Both of those are operators that's filling a very specific mission to market and they are both outstanding operators in our mind. Dollar Tree has taken a bit longer than any of us had expected to sort of unfold Family Dollar, but that is now well on its way and all signs are that those are the two operators that we want to continue to partner with. Having said that, I think our exposure to that business is right around 5.2%. And will we propitiously grow that piece? Absolutely, with the right trends, with the right growth profile. We will absolutely continue to look to grow that. But we are not going to actively pursue these development-driven Family Dollar, Dollar General, Dollar Tree assets because those tend to not to be the type of assets with the right type of leases in terms of the triple-net nature that we like to pursue.
Collin Mings: Okay. Thank you very much for the color.
Operator: Our next question will come from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.
Karin Ford: Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering, Sumit, should we still expect to see broaden your verticals out in the US this year or do you feel like you have enough on your plate with the international initiative that you announced?
Sumit Roy: I'm smiling, Karin. Last week we came out with something huge and our hope is that we will continue to explore. And the timing is what remains uncertain as to whether it's going to be next quarter or next month or maybe even a year from now that we can come up with something different. This international foray is a big step for us. It does increase the potential market from $4 trillion to potentially $12 trillion now and we want to make sure that we do this it right on the international front. But that certainly does not preclude us from continuing to explore some of other paths that we have been exploring over the last three months. And if something does take shape and becomes actionable and we decide to pursue it, we will again do something similar to what we did last week and come and share that with you. But I can't really tell you what the timing on some of those other avenues are going to be and I think I had been asked this question before as to why not, and the answer is pretty obvious because some of these avenues that we are pursuing today we may choose not to after we've done our diligence and, or all the product doesn't lend itself to those avenues even if the avenue seems to theoretically makes a lot of sense. So that's tied down to that question, Karin.
Karin Ford: Understood. Appreciate that. My second question is along the same line. You've generated very consistent FFO and dividend growth over the years with below average volatility. Is one of the goals of the new strategic initiatives to push earnings growth higher than it has been historically?
Sumit Roy: No. Look, I think our only goal was to continue to look at expanding the potential viable investment set. The idea here is to not compromise on either our balance sheet strategy or the types of businesses that we are pursuing with the profile of the businesses that we are pursuing. I mean, those remain intact, Karin. I think most people who invest in us, they invest in us because of the fact that we have this low-vol, dependable growth business. And I don't think we're going to compromise on that particular front. But that does not preclude us from looking at new avenues of growth. That sort of lend itself to this profile that we've designed for ourselves. And there is in certain products we believe a mismatch where the perception may be that it tends to be higher risk or higher volatility and it's for us to then -- if we decide to pursue that to-- if we decide to pursue that, it is on us to then show to you why we believe that it's sort of falls in line with the profile that we've designed for ourselves. So for us growth is really an output of this exercise rather than the driver of this exercise, and that is nuanced but something very, very important to us.
Karin Ford: Thanks for taking my questions.
Sumit Roy: Sure.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from John Massocca of Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.
John Massocca: Good afternoon.
Sumit Roy: Hi, John.
John Massocca: So, as you stated investment-grade rated assets as a percentage of acquisitions came down or a little bit low this quarter maybe versus kind of what you've done in the first nine months of 2018. Was this a similar situation to 4Q 2018 where it was just the mix and there's a lot of assets in there that simply aren't rated? Or was there maybe a better risk-adjusted return you felt you were getting by going after sub-investment grade-rated companies?
Sumit Roy: Yes. I would say that a lot of them fell into this non-rated bucket. And given our conservative nature, we obviously do our own underwriting to figure out what the implied rating would be if there were to be rated. But we categorized them as sub-investment grade for your purposes. And so, look, again, people have often said we only pursue investment grade-rated tenants that is and we compromise on growth and on initial yield but that has never been what we've done. Again, this is an output of the strategy that we have put in place and it just happens to be that a lot of the assets that we closed on in the first quarter have a profile that again low-vol, predictable business models that have high drop to breakeven in sales if it's a variable cost business or -- sorry, I said it the opposite way. And that is very important to us. But just because we had a 30% investment grade-rated tenants in the first quarter, that really was the output of the types of products that we ended up closing on. But the industry and we've shared that with you, the industries that they belong to, the tenants that they happen to be, these are tenants that are very high quality and somebody mentioned LifeTime Fitness, that’s a business that we really like and they are well north of the coverage ratio -- rent coverage ratios that our overall portfolio has and their breakeven in drop to sales is over 40%, but yet that's going to fall in the non-investment grade-rated bucket because it's a private company that doesn't have a rating. So I wouldn't look anything into that particular number. It is going to continue to move around and a perfect example would be Sainsbury's next quarter. It's a non-rated company but if you run the metrics through the S&P credit model which is what we did, it would be rated investment-grade. But there again, that's a very large transaction that is going to not have the investment grade, it won't be part of that investment-grade profile. Hopefully that helps.
John Massocca: No, that makes complete sense. And then, can you maybe provide a little color on any tenant credit-driven vacancy in the quarter? If I heard you right, you had 101 leases expire. If I kind of look on page 21 of the sup, that would imply there were around 10 or so assets that were vacant because of -- not because of the expiring leases but because of tenant credit. What drove that? I know it's not a huge number, but just any color there would be helpful.
Sumit Roy: Sure. Happy to address that. We have eight Shopco assets and these were largely second-generation assets for us. And few of those 10-odd came from the Shopco assets. And we expect most of them to come back to us. But it is -- I want to say 17 basis points of rent. So completely immaterial, but those definitely drove some of that 101 vacancies.
John Massocca: I appreciate the color. That's it from me. Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.
Karin Ford: Hi, just one quick one for Paul. Any plans to refinance the line balance later on this year with the bond deal? And are you considering a commercial paper program or forward equity?
Paul Meurer: Yes. Well, as Sumit commented earlier, we obviously given the new Sainsbury's we felt compelled to not issue new capital in Q1, thinking that that was material information for a potential equity investor, for example. In addition, we had raised a fair amount of capital end of last year. So we sit here today with that $800 million plus balance, but it is a $3 billion line, so we have plenty of liquidity. We don't feel compelled per se relative to a need for capital relative to our acquisition pipeline in the near term or anything of that sort. And all forms of capital are available to us. So, equity, bonds, each are really well priced right now. Bonds are something, let's say, by year-end we would certainly be considering as part of the mix. Typically our mix is going to be two-thirds plus of equity and the remainder thinking about unsecured bonds. So we could definitely see that as a part of it in. And the relative to commercial paper, it's kind of on that list of new ideas that we are looking into and considering. And it's something I think is very possibly part of our future, but you won't see it in the immediate near term.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I'll now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing everyone in a few weeks at ICSC and in the summer at NAREIT. Thank you everyone.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-21 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the VEREIT Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Bonni Rosen, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Bonni Rosen: Thank you, Andrew. Thank you for joining us today for the VEREIT 2018 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Call. Joining me today are Glenn Rufrano, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Bartolotta, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on our website at vereit.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at approximately 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time today. Dial-in for the replay is 1-877-344-7529 with the confirmation code of 10127690.  Before I turn the call over to Glenn, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements in this earnings call, which are not historical facts, will be forward-looking. VEREIT's actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC filings, including the annual report filed today. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports, VEREIT disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by law.  Let me quickly review the format of today's call. First, Glenn will begin by providing a business and operational update, followed by Mike presenting our quarterly and year-end financial results. Glenn will then discuss 2019 guidance, and we will conclude today's call by opening the line for questions. Glenn, let me turn the call over to you.
Glenn Rufrano: Thanks, Bonni, and thank you all for joining our call today. We are pleased with the results for the year as we met or exceeded the core components of our business plan and guidance. AFFO per diluted share was $0.72. We had another very active year of capital allocation with over $4.6 billion transacted. Acquisitions totaled $500 million, and we repurchased $50 million of stock at an average price of $6.94. Dispositions totaled $567 million. We entered into a new credit facility with a $2 billion revolver and $900 million 5-year loan at more favorable terms than our previous one and refinanced $598 million convertible debt with a $550 million 7-year unsecured bond issuance. Net debt to normalized EBITDA ended the year at 5.9x, which includes the effect of $217.5 million in settlement payments. We remain very liquid and have no unsecured maturities until December 2020. We also had a very active year of leasing with 6.6 million square feet of activity and occupancy ending at a healthy 98.8%. Same-store rent was up 1% for the quarter and 0.5% for the year. Excluding the effect of an early lease renewal, same-store rents would have been 1.3% for the quarter and 1% for the year. We had approximately 2 million square feet expiring in 2018. However, as I just mentioned, we leased 6.6 million square feet, of which 4.6 million square feet were early renewals. This year's leasing performance is a good illustration of our leasing team's focus on our forward expiration schedule. For example, over the last 2 years, we have reduced this year, 2019, expirations by 1.6% from 4.7% to 3.1%.  Notable renewal transactions included 3.8 million square feet of industrial, 1.3 million square feet of retail, 628,000 square feet of office and 381,000 square feet of restaurants. For new leases, we recaptured 104% of prior rents, renewals 95% and early renewals 98%. We continue to see a robust commercial real estate market with $562 billion transacted during 2018, an increase of roughly 15% from last year. Liquid debt market supported real estate activity. We participated in this activity with $22 billion of single-tenant properties offered to us and were able to spread invest with acquisition cap rates of 7.1 and disposition cap rates of 6.9. With that as a backdrop, fourth quarter acquisitions totaled $221 million, bringing 2018 acquisitions to $500 million. Dispositions in the fourth quarter totaled $184 million with $567 million for the year. Acquisitions have been targeted to discount retail, and functional well-located industrial properties. 68% of our acquisitions were retail properties and are preferred merchandise categories, such as home furnishings, hobby, discount, fitness and convenience, with 32% industrial, primarily in distribution facilities. Sourcing of this product resulted in 42% sale leasebacks and 22% built-to-suit properties. Our acquisitions benefit portfolio health and allow us to remain within our disciplined guidelines. Along with acquisitions, dispositions continue to be directed towards improving the portfolio. Our strategy has focused on reducing restaurants, office, flat leases, JVs and noncore.  From the start of our business plan, we've improved portfolio metrics. Our top 10 tenants represented 27.2%, down from 33.3% in 2015. Red Lobster is now 5.5%, down from 11.8%. Office is 19.3%, down from 22%. Flat leases are now under 20%. Investment grade tenants remain healthy at 42%.  As important, we're focused on our debt balances. We've reduced net debt to normalized EBITDA from 7.5 to 5.9. We also took a very important step in simplifying our business model with the sale of Cole Capital completed in February of last year. As part of that sale, our transition services agreement will end in March. Mike will cover this as part of his G&A discussion. Before Mike reviews our financial results, let me provide a brief update on litigation. During 2018, all fact depositions were completed, and we settled claims brought by opt out shareholders representing 31% of VEREIT's outstanding shares of common stock for a total of $217.5 million. Subsequent to the year, we settled with additional shareholders for approximately $15.7 million, which brings the total to $233.2 million representing 33.5%. The judge has set a trial date for September 9 of this year and the next status conference with the court is scheduled for April 17. Additional details regarding pending litigations can be found in our 10-K filed today. Let me turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Bartolotta: Thanks, Glenn, and thank you all for joining us today. We finished the year on plan achieving AFFO per share of $0.72. As usual, we will focus on earnings from continuing operations for this call. In the fourth quarter, rental revenue was flat compared to last quarter. In our 10-K, you will note that the operating expense reimbursement line has been combined in rental revenue for all periods presented in order to streamline our statement of operations. However, this detail can still be found in the definition section of the supplement. Net income increased $101.8 million to $27.9 million from a net loss of $73.9 million, primarily due to lower net litigation and settlement costs of $115.1 million, along with higher other income of $8.1 million from the gain on the sale of certain mortgage-related securities and an unexpected receipt from a fully reserved receivable, partially offset by a lower gain on the disposition of real estate of $19.4 million. FFO per diluted share increased $0.12 from $0.04 to $0.16, mostly due to lower net litigation and settlement costs to $115.1 million, along with higher other income of $8.1 million, partially offset by higher G&A of $2 million and interest expense of $2 million in the fourth quarter.  AFFO per share decreased approximately $0.005 to $0.17 per share, mostly due to higher G&A and interest expense. The G&A increase was primarily due to normal Q4 year-end compensation and other accrual adjustments. Full year G&A was $63.9 million, slightly under our guidance range of $65 million to $68 million. As part of the Cole Capital transition services ending, we indicated there would be an increase in G&A. There has been a lag in the recognition of that increase into this year, and our guidance for 2019 is a similar range of $66 million to $69 million. Our guidance for 2019 G&A assumes that we will take a restructuring charge in 2019 of approximately $11 million to rightsize our operations once the Cole transition agreement ends on March 31, 2019. This charge will include the onetime cost of reducing space in our Phoenix and New York offices, which represents about 80% of the estimated restructuring costs. CapEx for the year was $22.2 million, and over the last three years, we have averaged just over $20 million. For 2019, we expect CapEx cost will be closer to $30 million.  During the quarter, there were $7.8 million of litigation expenses. We previously indicated that we expected to be at the higher end of our guidance range of $55 million to $65 million, and we ended with a net amount of $59.8 million. However, included in this amount is a fourth quarter reduction of $10.9 million, due to a direct reimbursement from our insurer to a third party. Expenses would have been $70.7 million for the year had this not been the case. Also, as part of the insurance litigation settlement, the company received $48 million in insurance proceeds in the first quarter of 2019. We expect gross litigation expenses in 2019 will not be less than 2018.  As Glenn discussed, subsequent to year-end, we settled with additional shareholders for approximately $15.7 million, which was accrued in the fourth quarter litigation-related expenses, bringing this item in the financial to $23.5 million in Q4. Turning to our fourth quarter real estate activity. The company purchased 10 properties for $221 million at a weighted average cash cap rate of 7.1%. Acquisitions totaled $500 million for the year at an average cash cap rate of 7.1%. Subsequent to the quarter, the company purchased 3 properties for $37 million.  During the quarter, we disposed of 37 properties for $148 million. Of this amount, $141 million was used in the total weighted average cash cap rate calculation of 7.1%, including $49 million in net sales of Red Lobster. The gain on the fourth quarter sales was approximately $26 million. In addition, the company sold certain legacy mortgage-related investments during the quarter for an aggregate sales price of $36 million.  Dispositions for 2018 totaled $521 million at an average cash cap rate of 6.9% and a capital gain of $97 million. In addition, the company sold certain legacy mortgage-related investments in 2018 totaling $46 million. Subsequent to the quarter, the company disposed of 8 properties for an aggregate sales price of $9 million and $8 million of certain legacy mortgage-related investments as well. In 2018, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and remain very liquid. In May, we entered into a new $2.9 billion credit facility replacing our $2.3 billion facility. The new facility was comprised of a $2 billion unsecured revolving line of credit and a $900 million related to our unsecured term loan. In August, the company repaid $598 million of principal outstanding related to the 2018 convertible notes. In October, we completed a 4.625% $550 million bond issuance. This 7-year bonds fit nicely into our maturity schedule as we had no debt coming due in 2025.  As of year-end, we had drawn $253 million on our revolving line of credit and $150 million on our term loan. Subsequent to year-end, we utilized the remainder of the delayed-draw term loan to pay the $750 million bond, which just matured in the beginning of February. We now have no unsecured maturities until the end of 2020. Additionally, we reduced our secured debt by $12.5 million in the fourth quarter and a total of $154 million for the year. We will continue to have any secured debt that is maturing be termed out as unsecured debt. Our net debt to normalized EBITDA ended at 5.9x. Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio remained healthy at 2.9x, and our net debt to gross real estate investments ratio was 40%. Our unencumbered asset ratio was 75%. The weighted average duration of our debt was 4.2 years and is 92% fixed. Subsequent to year-end, we entered into a interest rate swap, fixing the interest on the $900 million term loan, which will bring our floating rate debt to approximately 4.4% and locks in an effective rate of 3.84%. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Glenn.
Glenn Rufrano: Thanks, Mike. I'll now turn to guidance for 2019. AFFO per share between $0.68 and $0.70. Normalized debt -- net debt to normalized EBITDA of approximately 6x. Real estate operations with average occupancy above 98% and same-store rental growth ranging from 0.3% to 1%. Dispositions totaling $350 million to $500 million at an average cap rate of 6.5% to 7.5%, targeting our continued diversification categories, restaurants, office, flat lease and noncore. Acquisition guidance of $250 million to $500 million at an average cap rate of 6.5% to 7.5%, primarily in discount retail and industrial distribution. Acquisitions and dispositions have been generally matched as we remain conscious of our debt levels. Our guidance does not assume resolution of any pending litigation. We are very pleased with capital market funding. Since we've initiated our business plan back in 2015, we've had a total capital activity of $11 billion; $1.4 billion in acquisitions, $3.7 billion in dispositions and $5.8 billion of debt and equity. This has allowed us to strengthen and diversify our portfolio, reduce debt and obtain investment-grade ratings, better allowed our maturity schedule and provided ample liquidity in the form of unencumbered assets and availability on our line of credit. We have navigated in an evolving market with our experienced management team and are well positioned for 2019. Looking beyond 2019, we will have a healthy portfolio, well-organized operating platform and a solid balance sheet. I'll now open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Sheila McGrath of Evercore.
Sheila McGrath: Glenn, your same-store rents were up 1%, much better than historical. Can you give us a little bit more detail what was driving that outperformance in the quarter?
Glenn Rufrano: Sure, Sheila. As we've discussed in the past, our leasing teams have been working on early renewals, and you can see this year, we had actually 2 million square feet that came due but we leased 6.6 million. That's really good in terms of our expirations and increasing NAV, but on a short-term basis, it has depressed some of our same store. What we found in the fourth quarter, some of that depression giving people some early rents when we have lower same-store came back to us. So we recognized some increases in that temporary amount of same store due to early renewals.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, great. And then can you help us understand how many more opt-out opportunities there might be for VEREIT to settle prior to the September trial? And also if you could give us any insights if these settlements have prompted any additional discussions with the class ahead of the September trial?
Glenn Rufrano: Well, let me go back and go through some of the history, Sheila. I understand your question, and let's see if I can straighten some of that out, some concepts of opt out versus the last settlement that we just announced for $15.7 million. If we go back to last year, we had 14 opt outs and opt out, I'll define here, is a shareholder, who filed a lawsuit separate from the class. So we had 14 filed separately. We settled with 13 of those 14 last year and that total number was $217.5 million for 31%. That leaves 1 opt out left. Substantially, the rest of the litigation is the class, including that opt out. So that sets the stage for what an opt out is and the definition. We announced this year that we had a settlement with a group of shareholders, who decided not to participate as class members, they're in the class, they decided not to participate as class members. That group had their own outside counsel representing those shareholders, and they approached the company. We did have a settlement with them, they represented approximately 2.5% for $15.7 million. That's the total of $233.2 million for the 33.5%. Those are the facts of what have occurred. So there is 1 opt out left as defined as a shareholder, who filed a suit, the rest of the shareholders are in the class.
Sheila McGrath: So there is no reason to believe that anybody else would leave the class to settle early, is that accurate?
Glenn Rufrano: I think the best way I can answer to that is that a group of shareholders in the class decided to bring outside counsel into the situation, representing them and approached us. That's the best way I can answer that.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. And one last question. Can you explain in a little bit more detail that $48.4 million insurance settlement, what that was related to? And if you will be able to collect on any additional legal expenses from the insurance?
Michael Bartolotta: This is Mike, Sheila. That primarily were bills in the past that we had paid and had made claims for and it was simply in the process of being worked through and then with the settlement of the insurance litigation at the end of the year, that's when those amounts were eventually able to be paid in the first quarter. And that represents -- those payments that we talked about, the $10.9 million that went to the third party and the $48 million that went to us, that represents substantially all of the coverage.
Glenn Rufrano: And just, Sheila, to go back, we had received $20 million before that. So if you add all that up, it's about $80 million. And the reason, the last pieces were stuck, is that there was litigation with the insurer, which we settled up, and we're able to free up the remaining funds.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Paolone of JPMorgan.
Anthony Paolone: I'll start with the litigation since we're on that. One is, when would you start any process to go after proceeds from codefendants on stuff that's been settled already?
Glenn Rufrano: There is no decision made on that, Anthony, at this time.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. And then, if we get through 2019 and suppose that the class and/or opt outs get settled along the same lines that what's been settled thus far, has been done at, how would you change the way you're running the business or what you're doing, if at all, at this point?
Glenn Rufrano: The first thing I’d say is that in terms of your question, I just want to make clear that we have no accrual in our balance sheet for any remaining pending litigation and Mike, why don't you explain why?
Michael Bartolotta: And we don't believe that any accrual at this point can be made under GAAP, because we don't believe it could be reasonably estimated.
Glenn Rufrano: I just want to make that clear. Then to answer the heart of your question, Tony, what do we look like when we grow up? We have worked really hard in the last 3.5 years to make sure that this company has the best portfolio, the best management team and a best and liquid balance sheet. As I said on -- in my statement, we look forward to beyond 2019 with those 3 elements, and with those 3 elements, we can compete with anybody in the business. We have to prove ourselves, we have to grow AFFO, but we have the tools to do it, and we'll continue to have the tools to do it, so that we can compete with and what we think is a very good business, a business that provides equity to corporate America, in return getting back their housing long-term and providing a long and stable balance sheet with the ability to grow it with accretive acquisitions.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. And then, if I look at the portfolio today, I think the weighted average remaining lease term is 8.9 years. And if we look at your 2019 guidance, not a huge amount of net activity. So you kind of move along another year, if you will. How do you think about that number over time? And any concern over it getting shorter in terms of the remaining duration before you can kind of return to growth and kind of add longer-duration assets to it? Like, how do you think about that?
Glenn Rufrano: Well, we were at 9.5 years about three years ago. And we're now at 8.9. That's pretty good for a company that has been mainly selling and not buying. We've been able to maintain that differential in three ways. We have been selling some shorter-term assets, and if we think it's right and then primarily noncore, we'll sell them, which could help that. What we have bought has generally been well over 15 years. And the third element I point to is what I talked about early on. Our leasing team is doing an awful lot of early renewals. And as we're doing early renewals, we're extending leases. So the combination of portfolio management in those three areas, acquisition, disposition and expansions, has allowed us to minimize the dilution involved over the last three years. We will continue to do that. We're conscious of it, we like to keep it as high as -- as reasonably high as possible and maintain a quality portfolio.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. And then just last question. I think, Mike, you mentioned $11 million of restructuring charges. Is that in the AFFO number? Or is that an add back?
Michael Bartolotta: No, it's not included in AFFO. The restructuring is outside of it.
Glenn Rufrano: And Tony, as we mentioned, a large part of that is on space in Phoenix and here. Just to be clear, Phoenix is our headquarters, and it will remain our headquarters, but we're going to be reducing space as Cole moves out, and we'll stay in that same building, but we'll be going from basically 4 floors to 1.5. And in New York, we're actually going to move out of the building we're sitting in right now and reduce our space in half and move a couple of blocks away.
Operator: The next question comes from Spenser Allaway of Green Street Advisors.
Spenser Allaway: Looking at your external growth guidance for '19, how much of the $375 million in acquisitions do you expect to come from deals with existing tenants versus those that would be new to your portfolio?
Glenn Rufrano: Well, it's -- the way I think about that, Spenser, is where on the transaction it's coming from. As you noticed, we have 42% of our transactions in sale leasebacks this year and about 20% in build to suits. Many of those are clients of ours coming back to us. Sometimes they will come through a broker, but they're primarily people we've done business with in sale leasebacks and build to suits. If we can maintain that form of ratio, I would hope that -- I expect at least 50% of what we do will come through brokers. And maybe we can do another 50% direct, if we can maintain those relationships.
Spenser Allaway: Okay. And then on the disposition front, you guys noted you're going to continue to reduce your exposure to restaurants, noncore, et cetera. But could you maybe comment on your exposure to double-net leases. I believe it's about 35% of your annualized rental income. Is there any intention to reduce this exposure?
Glenn Rufrano: We have no direct relationship between sales and double net. We feel fully qualified to manage these properties. We have a full team that does that. And if there is a little more risk there, we have the infrastructure to take that risk. So there is no -- any reason at all for us to discount or sell because they're double net or triple net. We look at them, price the risk and feel very comfortable with it.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Glenn Rufrano for any closing remarks.
Glenn Rufrano: Thanks, everybody, for joining us. We feel very good about our year and very good about what's to come. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q3  (2018-11-01 14:30:00) =====
Executives: Janeen Bedard - Senior Vice President Sumit Roy - President and Chief Executive Officer Paul Meurer - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Analysts: Karin Ford - Mitsubishi UFG Securities (USA), Inc. Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC Collin Mings - Raymond James John Massocca - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2018 Operating Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead.
Janeen Bedard: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter 2018 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Sumit Roy.
Sumit Roy: Thanks, Janeen. Welcome to our call today. I am honored to have taken on the role as CEO and I am excited about the future of Realty Income given the strength of our diversified high quality portfolio, strong investment opportunities, and most importantly our talented team. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Board and the team to evolve and execute on our strategic priorities, and I am confident Realty Income can continue to capture opportunities to build and enhance our portfolio and drive value for our stakeholders. I would also like to thank our former CEO, John Case, for his service and guidance over the years. John has played a pivotal role in building the Company into what it is today and we wish him the very best. In my seven years with the Company, I've had the opportunity to meet many of our investors and analysts and I look forward to enhancing this engagement in the future. With that, let’s turn to the business. We continue to see strength in the current market environment as well as our investment pipeline. During the third quarter, we invested $609 million in high quality property acquisitions and increased AFFO per share by 5.2%. S&P raised our credit rating to A- during the quarter, which was largely driven by our consistent track record of performance and the stability of our portfolio. Given the current strength in our business, we are increasing the low-end of our 2018 AFFO per share guidance by $0.02, from $3.16 to $3.21, to a range of $3.18 to $3.21. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 260 commercial tenants in 48 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties just over 12% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.4% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 12.1% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with the service, non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with ecommerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate with the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9x on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.7x. Our watch list at 1.4% of rent remains consistent with our levels of the last few years. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.8%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the year-ago period. We expect occupancy to remain in the mid-98% for 2018. During the quarter, we released 64 properties, recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent. Year-to-date, we have released 166 properties, recapturing approximately 106% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold over 2,800 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were released. Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date. These results are consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 87% of the releases have contractual rent increases. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results.
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Sumit. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5% for the quarter and 5.3% year-to-date. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, excluding the recent CEO severance payment. We continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in 2018. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1% for the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. This compares favorably to our 2017 run rate due to lower bad debt expense and the timing of certain expenses. We continue to expect non-reimbursable property expenses to generally be in the 1.5% to 2% range. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.81 for the quarter. As a reminder, a reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.81 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.2% increase. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure, which we believe contributed to the SMP upgrade to A- that Sumit mentioned earlier. Combined with our upgrade to A3 by Moody's a year-ago, we are now one of only a few REITs with at least AA ratings. During the third quarter, we issued $293 million of common stock primarily through our ATM program. Our overall leverage remains modest as our debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains 5.5 times, and our fixed charge coverage remained healthy at 4.6 times. The weighted-average maturity of our bonds is approximately nine years, which is over a year longer than it was a year-ago. Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with only $7.3 billion of debt coming due the remainder of this year and only $91 million coming into next year and our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter. In summary, we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and excellent liquidity. Last week, we were very pleased to announce the expansion of our $3.25 billion unsecured credit facility. The new facility increases the capacity of our revolver from $2 billion to $3 billion, plus a $1 billion accordion expansion feature. The initial maturity date is March 2023 plus 2 6-month extension options, thereafter. The increased line capacity enhances our liquidity and provide ready access to capital for our property acquisition efforts. Our borrowing spread decreased to 77.5 basis points over LIBOR, which matches the tightest pricing grid in the REIT industry. As part of the recast, we also issued a new $250 million term loan with a tenor of just under 5.5 years. Concurrently, we executed a floating to fixed interest rate swap, which effectively fixed the interest rate on the term loan at 3.89%. 23 lenders participated in the new credit facility, many of whom we have done business with for several years. We very much appreciate the long-term support of our banking partners as we've grown over the years and we welcomed the lenders who are new to the relationship with Realty Income. Now, let me turn the call back over to Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thanks Paul. I’ll now move to our investment activity. During the third quarter of 2018, we invested $609 million in 238 properties located in 25 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.34% and with a weighted-average lease term of 15.3 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 62% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 99.4% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 19 different tenants in 14 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores, restaurants, and dollar stores. We closed 14 discrete transactions in the third quarter. Year-to-date 2018, we've invested $1.465 billion in 591 properties located in 37 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.32%, and with a weighted-average lease term of 14.4 years. On a revenue basis, 67% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 96% of the revenues are generated from retail and 4% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 37 different tenants in 20 industries. Of the 39 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 5 transactions were above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. During the third quarter, we sourced more than $8.4 billion in acquisition opportunities. Of the opportunities sourced during the third quarter, 58% were portfolios and 42% or approximately $3.6 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $26 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 39% of the volume sourced for the third quarter. Of the $609 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 7% were one-off transactions. As to pricing, cap rates have essentially remained unchanged in the third quarter. Investment-grade properties continue to trade around 5% to high 6% cap rate range, and non-investment grade properties trade from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads, relative to our weighted-average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 154 basis points in the third quarter, which was slightly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as an initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted-average cost of capital. Our investment pipeline remains robust and we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remained one of the only publicly traded net lease companies that has the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. Year-to-date, 81% of our acquisitions have been sale leaseback transactions. We remain confident in achieving our 2018 acquisition guidance of approximately $1.75 billion. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 20 properties for net proceeds of $35.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.3% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.8%. This brings us to 60 properties sold year-to-date for $83 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.9%. Largely due to the timing of dispositions, we are decreasing our disposition guidance for 2018 from approximately $200 million to approximately $150 million. In September, we increased the dividend for the 98 time in our Company's history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year ago period. We have increased our dividends every year since the companies listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.6%. We are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. To wrap it up, we are pleased with the current state of the company and remain excited about our prospects moving forward. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Christy McElroy with Citi.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Christy. Wondering if you could provide some color on any additional acquisitions and process that are on contract currently, just to get a better sense for timing at the end of the year. And based on opportunities you're seeing in the market today, would you expect a similar pace of acquisitions in 2019?
Sumit Roy: So as we've always indicated acquisitions are very, very difficult to forecast year out. What I can share with you, that in the fourth quarter we have a very healthy pipeline. We feel very confident about meeting our $1.75 billion guidance. We will probably exceed it by a bit. But at this point to talk about what we are planning on doing in 2019 will be premature.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And then just one quick follow-up on the dispositions during the quarter. Was there anything in particular that drove the cap rate a bit higher this quarter and what should we expect as far as pricing for remaining asset sales in the balance of the year?
Sumit Roy: The cap rates are largely driven by the types of assets that are being sold. We did reduce our guidance from $200 billion to $150 billion and that was largely being driven by timing and some opportunistic sales that we pulled from the market. So we feel like, our IRR should be right around 8%, which we have historically achieved and should be able to get to $150 million in sales by the end of the year.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: And next we will go to Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.
Karin Ford: Hi, good morning out there. Sumit, congratulations on the new role. The Company's last two press releases both mentioned that you'd be working with the Board to evolve the company strategy. Can you elaborate what that evolution might entail? And could we see – be seeing investments in new asset classes or a change in the way management looks to create value for shareholders?
Sumit Roy: Thank you for your question, Karin. What I would want to emphasize is that we will continue to execute on our current strategy as we believe the market remains very strong for the product that we are pursuing. And that was quite evident in the results that we achieved year-to-date as well as in the third quarter. The team that we have in place here has largely been together for the last five years and was the architect and devised the current strategy that we have in place that we've been executing quite successfully. Having said that, we are always looking for new avenues to grow. Four or five years ago, six years ago, we entered into the industrial market. Right along then, we also explored agriculture and ended up making an investment in Napa Valley. So to look at new avenues of growth is something that we are constantly doing and we’ll continue to do so. But having said that, we believe there's enough runway in our current strategy and we feel very confident of meeting growth rates on a risk adjusted basis that will be viewed as appropriate for this company.
Karin Ford: Thanks for that. My second question is regarding investments. You've had a lot of successes here with corporate sale leasebacks. Do you think that could continue into next year or do you expect the changing lease accounting rules might reduce demand for those deals?
Sumit Roy: The changes in the lease rules have not impacted our discussions with our relationship tenants. In fact, if anything and we've spoken about this in the past, the viable market for sale leaseback continues to grow and continues to grow with tenants that traditionally wouldn't engage in those conversations. So our take on our pipeline for 2019, the current discussions that we're having with our existing relationships and some new relationships lead us to believe that the lease changes will have a very – will have no impact and the market, the viable market for sale leaseback will continue to grow.
Operator: And our next question will come from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra: Thanks for taking the question. Sumit, the last time you had a very attractive cost of capital? Maybe 2 years ago, you chose to buy higher quality to a lot of drug stores, that exposure in certain areas. Just wondering now you’re sitting here relative, you have a very good cost of capital to maybe other REIT asset classes. What do you plan to do with it maybe similar and maybe different?
Sumit Roy: Well, what we hope to believe is that the higher cost – the lower cost of capital that was afforded to us was a function of the strategy that we had implemented and what we had highlighted to the market as the types of retail products and the industrial products that we were most interested in. And the fact that we've continued to be quite successful and once again find ourselves with a very low cost of capital. On a relative basis, we've always had a low cost of capital and if you look at what's happened over the last three to four years, the cost of equity for us has been on a relative basis amongst the lowest. Now with these two upgrades, the cost of debt has become even lower than most of our peers. So on a blended basis, we've always had the advantage of having a very low cost of capital. I don't think that that necessarily comes into the calculus in terms of defining what a strategy needs to be. We want to be very true to anything. We believe we have a strategy in place that allows us to create a balance sheet and a portfolio that can do very well regardless of what the economic conditions are. And we are going to continue to do that. And the fact that we have a very low cost of capital today, I don't think necessarily is going to change the strategy that we have in place and some of the other avenues that we are continuing to explore, given what we find in the cost of capital.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. And then just – second question I know we've talked over the last couple of weeks on this and I think everyone's just trying to get a better sense of how this change occurred? How it was taught about it seemed a bit sudden in terms of John's departure. So I'm just wondering if you can give us some sense of how this was being contemplated anymore – more thoughts on just the discussions and maybe just to build off of one of the earlier questions on. I know you'd said nothing too different, but maybe what would you be doing incremental from here?
Sumit Roy: So to answer the question around the suddenness, I mean this was a decision that the Board and John mutually agreed upon. These are discussions that oftentimes happens. When you think about is there a good time for a change and see that never it really is. And – but the Board and John mutually agreed to part ways, the Board believe that making the transition now is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders and given the depth and strength of our management team and it was believe that doing it now versus down the road was the right decision. The speed question that you raised Vikram, I've said there are two schools of thought on that one, which is the more traditional route where you typically have a three to six month transition period. And that works in a situation where the incoming CEO may not be immediately ready to take on the reins. But in this case, both the Board and John concurred that I was ready to take on the reins and incorporating a transition period would have just delayed the inevitable. So from what's transpired, I think that should pretty much address how things have come about. In terms of what I'm going to do differently, the advantage that I've had is, I've worked with this team and have been part of this team for the last seven years and this team by and large has been intact for all of that time. I've been along with the team very much part and parcel of defining the strategy and then executing on the strategy. So there's a sense of continuity that we continue to have and that is going to bode well. So if you're looking to see for any dramatic changes in terms of how we’re going to conduct business, et cetera. I don't believe, you're going to see that. So its business as usual and what I might do slightly differently is be on the road a little bit more, be a bit more visible in terms of meeting shareholders, et cetera. And in terms of internally, and I think I've mentioned this in some individual conversations is have a flatter organizational structure where my connectivity with my direct reports i.e., all of the EPVs in the company, is going to be, just have one degree of separation. So those are very minor changes. But that's more in line with how I would like to run the Company, but in terms of strategy, et cetera. It's business as usual.
Operator: And next we’ll go to Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: Hi Sumit, congratulations on the promotion.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Todd.
Todd Stender: When you look at the 7-Eleven acquired in the quarter were these sale leasebacks and can you describe the lease terms, these are rent escalator, rent coverage, just some of the specifics? Thank you.
Sumit Roy: Sure. Yes. These are all sale leasebacks. I sort of alluded to the fact that we get very good pricing. I would go so far as to say that the pricing that we get on sale leasebacks that we are doing directly with 7-Eleven is in the tune of around 75 to 50 basis points higher than what you would get in the one-off market. They are 16-year average lease terms and they have a 7.5% growth every five.
Todd Stender: Okay. Thank you. And then Paul just looking at the balance sheet, your line balance was getting up close to $800 million just at the end of Q2, but that was on the $2 billion line and that used to be a big number, but relative to the size of the company, maybe not so. But on a $3 billion line, could we see that balance grow even higher? It may look on an absolute basis large, but maybe on a comparable basis, not so much. But how big that the line balance for you guys get?
Paul Meurer: So I think that's fair to consider from an overall risk management standpoint and variable rate debt exposure. These are relative to our peers and/or how we view the balance sheet. Keep in mind that the larger line was more a function of giving us the liquidity and flexibility on the acquisition front that we thought was appropriate as opposed to trying to foreshadow any change in balance sheet philosophy. Relative to the current balance on the line, I'll remind everyone that we closed on a $250 million term loan just a week or week or so ago, which then immediately was applied to that line. That was a funded term loan. And in addition, we have some property sales activity in the fourth quarter. So from a funding standpoint, the line balance will not be a very large. It's currently, as of a week ago was under $600 million after that term loan repayment. And we're not in a position where we need to access capital for any particular reason because our leverage metrics are very good as well. But all forms of it are available to us and we'll be taking a look at all forms of it on a go forward basis, but we're not in a position right now where we have any immediate funding needs.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Collin Mings with Raymond James.
Collin Mings: Thanks and congratulations Sumit.
Sumit Roy: Thanks Collin.
Collin Mings: Just first question for me, just going back to Karin's question actually. As your platform continues to grow, just maybe how are you currently thinking about international opportunities specifically?
Sumit Roy: We don't have immediate plans to go international. But like I've said, all avenues are on the table and we continued to look at avenues of growth of which to ignore international would be, wouldn't be correct. But we don't have any immediate plans to go international. And like I've said, Collin, we believe we have enough runway in executing our current strategy that gives us comfort that any one of these new avenues that we come up with, we will have time to test it, make sure that this is something that fits our overall strategy of conservatism and risk adjusted growth rates, and at the appropriate time we'll be ready to speak with the market about it, but no immediate plans.
Collin Mings: Okay. And then on – as far as the 7-Eleven, you touched on the cap rate differential between what you think the pricing would be on the one-off market versus, again being a portfolio. Like you suggested, maybe 75, 50 basis points. Just maybe making a little bit broader picture here, how are you thinking about the portfolio premium or discount in the marketplace right now and at maybe what threshold of – in terms of deal size do you start to see that really take effect?
Paul Meurer: Look over 80% of what we did was sale leasebacks this particular quarter. And what we're finding is with these large institutional tenants that we have very deep relationships with. They are very open to having discussions around adjusting cap rates to accommodate the changing cap rate environment and that accrues to our favor. The fact that we've been able to do north of $1 billion of 7-Eleven in the last two years and get cap rates that are off of the one-off market to the tune of 75 basis points speaks to that point. So we feel like that there are discounts that we get by entering into these portfolio transactions, especially with sophisticated institutional tenants.
Operator: And we’ll go next to John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.
John Massocca: Good afternoon. And first off, congratulation Sumit on the new role.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John.
John Massocca: So were there any other tenant industries that particularly dominated this quarter's acquisition activity? I know with the 7-Eleven, obviously, C-stores would be one of them, but anything outside of that?
Sumit Roy: There were C-stores and restaurants. Those were the two dominant areas of industries.
John Massocca: And my second question here, were those casual dining or QSR?
Sumit Roy: Casual dining.
John Massocca: Okay. And then does the current strategy leave open the potential for M&A activity, especially given the strong cost of capital? Or are you really still primarily focused on what you've done in the last couple of quarters in terms of larger sale leaseback transactions and given how strong that market has been for you guys?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Look we control the discussion around the sale leaseback market. These are organic acquisitions that have served us very well over the last few years. M&A is something that we don't count on and that's not to say that we are averse of doing M&A transactions. This Company has had a history of having done some of those, but that is not something that we control and we don't count on that. We are very happy with the runway that we have executing our current strategy and the numbers speak for themselves. So John, if you're asking this is something that we are aggressively going to start pursuing, then the answer is no, but we're not averse to M&A either.
John Massocca: Color is very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: And next we'll go to Christy McElroy with Citi.
Michael Bilerman: Hey, it’s Michael Bilerman here with Christy. So the question is just regarding the CEO transition. So did john get a bonus for 2018 or an accrued bonus relative to his comp level?
Sumit Roy: The severance was largely negotiated Michael and it was in line with his – the agreements that were in place as well as his employment agreement. So the 28 – approximately $28 million that we have listed was pretty much in line with his employment agreement and the agreement around his stock awards.
Michael Bilerman: I mean, if you read the proxy, it was generally in line with that, but we're sitting here in November effectively not – from a timing perspective, why would he agree to forego $10 million of a bonus if he worked basically until January 1 of next year. And I don't know many people that would give up $10 million, whether he could have rolled into next year and then decided to do it?
Sumit Roy: No, the fact that we – I think we’ve also just highlighted the fact that $9 million of it had already been accrued. So you can pretty much assume that what had been accrued for this year was part of the $28 million that was paid out. So I don't believe it's accurate for you to assume that his pro rata share, he had to forego that. End of Q&A
Operator: And this does conclude the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, Caroline, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you all at NAREIT conference next week. Thank you.
Operator: That will conclude today's conference. Thank you, everyone. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-08-02 14:30:00) =====
Executives: Janeen Bedard - SVP John Case - CEO Paul Meurer - CFO and Treasurer Sumit Roy - President and COO
Analysts: Joshua Dennerlein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Spenser Allaway - Green Street Advisors Nick Joseph - Citi Karin Ford - MUFG Securities Brian Hawthorne - RBC Capital Markets John Massocca - Ladenburg Thalmann
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Janeen Bedard: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income’s second quarter 2018 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company’s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.
John Case: Thanks Janeen. Welcome to our call today. We're pleased with our results in the second quarter. During the quarter we invested $347 million in high quality property acquisitions and increased AFFO per share by 5.3%. Given the momentum we see in our business, we are increasing our 2018 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.75 billion from the prior range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. We’re also raising the range of our 2018 AFFO per share guidance from $3.14 to $3.20 to $3.16 to $3.21.  Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks, John. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Other revenue in the quarter was $3.6 million. Other revenue typically consists of easements, take in, interest income and insurance proceeds and it will vary from quarter-to-quarter as we've mentioned in the past.  Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.7% for the quarter and 5.4% year-to-date. Consistent with prior year G&A tends to be slightly higher in the first half of the year due to the timing of stock vesting and the cost associated with their annual meeting and proxy. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and we continue to project G&A to be approximately 5% in all of 2018.  Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues were 1.5% for the quarter and 1.6% year-to-date. We expect non-reimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018.  Funds from operation or FFO per share was $0.79 for the quarter. As a reminder our reported FFO follows the NAREIT-defined FFO definition. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.80 per share for the quarter, representing a 5.3% increase.  Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the second quarter we issued $300 million of common stock primarily through our ATM program. The weighted average maturity of our bonds is now 9.2 years and our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with only $8.5 million of debt coming due the remainder of 2018, and only $91 million coming due in 2019, outside of our revolver. And our maturity schedule is very well laddered thereafter.  Our overall leverage remains modest as our debt to EBITDA ratio is currently 5.5 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 4.6 times. In summary we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics.  Now let me turn the call back over to John.
John Case: Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.7%, an increase of 20 basis points versus the year ago period. We expect occupancy to remain north of 98% for 2018. During the quarter we re-leased 47 properties recapturing approximately 108% of the expiring rent, making this our 8th consecutive quarter of positive recapture rates.  The first half of 2018 we have re-leased 102 properties recapturing approximately 105% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994 we have re-leased or sold 2750 properties with leases expiring. Recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased Our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 0.9% for the first half of the year. These results were consistent with our projected run rate for 2018 of 1%. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 257 commercial tenants and 48 different industries, located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue. In the second quarter, convenience stores became our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue. We continue to like the convenience store industry. We own high-quality real estate locations and profitable stores leased to leading national investment grade rated operators. Additionally, our convenience store portfolio, primarily consists the stores with the larger physical footprint. These stores tend to drive greater sales and volume, unrelated to fuel consumption, often featuring extensive prepared food options. Within our portfolio of retail properties, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today’s retail climate where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.9 times on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.8 times. Both of these store level metrics represent improvements from last quarter as our retail store level performance remains strong. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels of the last few years. Moving on to acquisitions. We completed $347 million acquisitions during the quarter at 6.5% cap rate at investment spreads consistent with our long-term average. Our investment spreads improved during the quarter, and we are pleased with the quality of our acquisitions. 52% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade rated tenants. Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. We remain one of the only publicly traded net lease companies that have the scale and cost of capital to pursue large corporate sale leaseback transactions on a negotiated basis. Year-to-date, approximately 80% of our acquisitions have been sale leaseback transactions. During the quarter, we sourced $7.7 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remained selective in our strategy, acquiring approximately 5% of the amount sourced. Given the continued strength and visibility in our investment pipeline and the current market environment, we are increasing our 2018 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.75 billion from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. I’ll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in a bit more detail. Sumit?
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John. During the second quarter of 2018, we invested $347 million in 190 properties, located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.6 years. 85% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 15 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are quick service restaurants and convenience stores. We closed 15 discrete transactions in the second quarter. Year-to-date 2018, we’ve invested $857 million in 358 properties located in 32 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% under the weighted average lease term of 13.8 years. On a revenue basis, 71% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 94% of the revenues are generated from retail and 6% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 28 different tenants in 17 industries. Of the 25 independent transactions closed year-to-date, three transactions were above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 67% were portfolios. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $17 billion in potential transaction opportunities, and of these opportunities, 60% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $7 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 24% for the second quarter. Of the $347 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 25% were one-off transactions. As to pricing, cap rates were essentially unchanged in the second quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging 151 basis points in the second quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as an initial cash yield, less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 26 properties for net proceeds of $33.7 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8.3%. This bring us to 40 properties sold year-to-date for $47.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7% and realized an unlevered IRR of 8%. In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target of $1.75 billion and disposition volume of approximately $200 million. With that I’d like to hand it back to John?
John Case: Thanks Sumit. We continue to have excellent access to the capital markets to fund our business and maintain our conservative balance sheet. We remain well-positioned upon our growth through a variety of avenues for the rest of the year. We currently have approximately $1.1 billion available on our line of credit, excluding our accordion feature. In June, we increased the dividend for the 97th time in our Company’s history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year-ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the Company’s listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.7%. And we are proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. To wrap it up, we’re pleased with our Company’s momentum across all areas of the business and remain optimistic about our prospects. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline, and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to favorable risk-adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders. At this time, I like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Joshua Dennerlein: Thanks for the question. Maybe you could talk about your views on Amazon’s entry into the pharmacy business and how that impact [ph] CVS, Walgreens, your portfolio?
John Case: Sure, Josh. I think that sort of the topic of the day is Amazon’s acquisition of PillPack and what the impact it’s going [technical difficulty] industry. PillPack has about five [technical difficulty] overall market share today, focus on drugs, treating long-term conditions [technical difficulty]about 25% of pharmacy sales, 50% of the drugs are for acute illnesses and 25% are for specialty drugs and these are typically handled by the brick-and-mortar pharmacies. So, PillPack is suitable for relatively small portion of the market. Walgreens and CVS are top two drugstore tenants, each have about 23% of the market. And both have been very successful recently, having positive same-store pharmacy sales for the last five years. Most consumers of drugs, based on surveys and industry trade information prefer face-to-face interaction when purchasing drugs. These are the older -- this is the older portion of our population, the baby [technical difficulty] Walgreens and CVS have become competitive on pricing [technical difficulty] integration alliances with PBMs. So, that’s helped them capture more market share [technical difficulty] also able to create captive market share through this vertical integration. And both, Walgreens and CVS offer same day and overnight delivery [technical difficulty] and or delivery in major markets today and continue to [technical difficulty] FedEx and Walgreens have formed a venture specifically for this purpose. Another statistic that gives us comfort is since 2010, brick and mortar drug stores have taken about 20% of the market share from mail order pharmacies. And again, this is due to them becoming more price competitive [technical difficulty]and out of convenience. 80% of the [technical difficulty] lives within a 5 miles of CVS or Walgreens, and the two -- the top two brick-and-mortar pharmacies continue to add in-house health clinics to drive pharmacy sales. So, we see that trend continuing and growing and having a positive impact on those brick-and-mortar businesses. The overall pharmacy market is growing by 5% per year, expected to continue to grow at a nice straight around 5%. There were [technical difficulty] not surprising to see new entrants. I’d say, importantly, our pharmacies are in outstanding real estate solutions that are fungible. And while our investment in the industry has declined by about 1.5% in the last 18 months, based on growth in other areas and selective asset sales, we remain really confident in the [technical difficulty] and specifically [technical difficulty]. So, we’re certainly comfortable with our investments there.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Spenser Allaway: You mentioned in the opening remarks that you’ve seen a good number of portfolio deals in the market. Is the increase in acquisition guidance for the year related to expectation [ph] to close some of these bigger portfolios or is this just a function of more one-off deals?
John Case: It’s a combination of portfolios as well as one-off transactions, Spenser. So, year-to-date, more than 80% of our acquisitions have been large -- larger negotiated [ph] sale leaseback transactions where we were the only company [ph] in negotiations with those tenants. And what we found is we’re seeing a market that’s really different than the broader sector. [Technical difficulty] because of our access to capital and cost of capital we’re able to execute very large sale-leaseback transactions on a negotiation basis which allow us -- which enable us really to diversify. So, a lot of companies in the sector can’t [technical difficulty]. So, some of the growth is coming from that activity and some of its continued one-off smaller portfolios, given a [technical difficulty] net lease acquisitions market.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: You mentioned that the cap rates on the blended basis were 6.5 for the quarter, I was wondering if you could break that down between the retail and industrial assets?
John Case: The industrial asset, [technical difficulty] really one large asset, a distribution center in Northern California that [technical difficulty]development take out and on development properties we get yields that are anywhere from the 100 to 150 basis points higher than where we get them on a stabilized basis. So, this particular -- on the industrial side our cap rates because it was the development property were actually higher than 6.5%. And then on the retail side, they were just slightly under that, Nick.
Nick Joseph: And you mentioned the watch list but [technical difficulty] meaningful changes to rent coverage ratio for any of your larger [technical difficulty]?
John Case: The information that’s been coming in, sales from our tenants that report are continuing to improve. And that’s why you saw our coverage levels pick up a little bit from where they were in the previous quarter. So, the news on a tenant level is positive and we feel very good about [technical difficulty] really minimal percentage is outstanding on the watch list.
Operator: Our next question will come from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Please go ahead.
Karin Ford: With over $500 million out on the line and in active pipeline, should we expect bond issuance in the second half of the year? And then if you over [technical difficulty] the second quarter acquisitions, just if you could give us your current thoughts on leverage in the current environment.
John Case: We’re pleased with the strength of the balance sheet today, debt to EBITDA at 5.5x. When we look forward, including the accordion, we have about $2 billion of capacity on the revolver. Our overall floating rate debt exposure [technical difficulty] right now. We also have [technical difficulty] we’re anticipating about $150 million in proceeds, asset sales, and we’re also anticipating probably about $75 million retained equity from our business in our operations to help fund our growth. Both, the bond -- really all the long-term capital markets are open to us right now, 10-year bond [technical difficulty] and right around four, three or so. So, that’s attractive. And as the appropriate [technical difficulty] all of our alternatives Karin with regard to financing the acquisitions.
Karin Ford: And my second question is, what are the trends you are seeing on investments [technical difficulty] quarter, so, so far in the third quarter. [technical difficulty] able to maintain them at above average levels for the rest [technical difficulty]?
John Case: Well, right now they are coming at attractive levels. So, I think the second quarter levels are pretty indicative of where [technical difficulty] this quarter, and we’re optimistic that spreads will continue to widen out a bit, so our margins will improve.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Brian Hawthorne with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Brian Hawthorne: Hi. On your industrial portfolio, are there any markets that you’re kind of starting to look at or get less interested in?
John Case: Well, we’ve on the industrial side had a strategy of being in significant markets where there’s good re-leasing opportunities if needed or in mission-critical locations. The markets that [technical difficulty] in right now, that’s a very attractive sector right now. And the valuations are quite attractive. But, we’re not seeing any huge speculative supply issues in any of those markets. So, what is being built by the developers out there is being leased typically, if it’s not already pre-leased, leased during the construction phase. And by the time it’s completed, it’s leased. So, you we’re not looking to exit any specific markets on the industrial side, Brian.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Spenser Allaway: Thanks. Sorry, guys. Just a quick follow-up as it relates to development. [Technical difficulty] development represents a small portion of portfolio and it does look like the pipeline has been winding down. Curious how you view development in the current environment specifically with construction cost summarized?
John Case: So, on the development side, it’s always been an attractive way for us to grow. So, we have $25 million under development today. As I said, the yields are more attractive on development than they are on acquisitions. So, we remain bullish on -- we’d like to have more underdevelopment, decent amount of development spend second quarter, but we’re looking to put more development on the books forward. Now to remind everyone, all the development is preleased. We don’t do speculative development and [technical difficulty] existing clients. So, certainly a low-risk form of development.
Operator: Our next question will come from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead. 
John Massocca: Quick modeling detail question. What specifically this quarter drove the sizable other income number? I know it’s variable quarter to quarter but I think Q2 2018 was higher than you guys do in most years.
John Case: [Technical difficulty] so that $2.6 million payment in insurance proceeds on one asset, an asset that was destroyed by a tornado and that showed up in our other income area. 
John Massocca: Okay. That makes sense. And then kind of philosophically, I know with [technical difficulty] valuation [technical difficulty] is probably not something that’s top of mind. But how do you look at your industrial assets potentially as a sort of [technical difficulty] if you were to see equity market volatility, given how kind of robust that market has been even at the beginning of this year?
John Massocca: We always [technical difficulty] asset sales, irrespective of [technical difficulty] as opportunities for us to [technical difficulty] capital and drive growth. And those asset sales are done on strategic bases, sometimes involving credits we want to limit our exposure to or markets we want to limit our exposure to or just decrease industry exposure. And sometimes those are -- those sales are driven opportunistically because we get really attractive pricing and a pricing which makes us [technical difficulty] conclude that it makes us more valuable company [technical difficulty] shareholders to sell the property and recycle the proceeds than to hold onto those assets. So, that’s how we look at our entire portfolio and there’s no doubt that currently industrial pricing is attractive but a number of our areas have attractive cap rates currently.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes this question-and-answer session portion of Realty Income conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.
End of Q&A:
John Case: All right. Well, thanks everybody for joining us today. And we look forward to seeing you this fall in conferences and marketing meetings. So, I hope everybody has a good summer and thanks again for joining us.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-05-09 13:00:00) =====
Executives: Janeen Bedard - SVP John Case - CEO Paul Meurer - CFO and Treasurer Sumit Roy - President and COO
Analysts: Nick Yulico - UBS Karin Ford - MUFG Securities Michael Bilerman - Citi Jason Belcher - Wells Fargo Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley John Massocca - Ladenburg Thalmann
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Realty Income First Quarter 2018 Operating Results Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Janeen Bedard: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income’s first quarter 2018 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company’s Forms 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.
John Case: Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We're pleased to begin the year with another successful quarter. During the first quarter, we invested $510 million in high quality property acquisitions and now over 50% of our rental revenue was generated from investment grade rated tenants. Our focus on quality is also reflected in our portfolio occupancy, which is 98.6%, our highest quarter en occupancy in more than 10 years. We reached this occupancy level, while achieving our seventh consecutive quarter of positive recapture spreads on properties released. We remain confident in the outlook for our business and are reiterating our 2018 AFFO per share guidance of $3.14 to $3.20, which represents annual growth of about 3% to 5%. Let me hand it over to Paul now to provide some additional detail on our financial results. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks, John. I will provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Interest expense in the quarter was flat despite a higher outstanding debt balance. This was largely due to the $2.3 million preferred dividend expense we recognized in the comparative quarter a year ago when we announced the redemption of our Series F preferred stock. Additionally, we recognized the larger interest rate swap gain this quarter, which has the effect of decreasing interest expense. Our G&A, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 5.1% for the quarter. We continued to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector and we project G&A to remain approximately 5% in 2018. Our non-reimbursable property expenses, as a percentage of total rental and other revenues, was 1.7% for the quarter and we expect non-reimbursable property expenses to remain in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2018. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.79 for the quarter, representing 11.3% increase over the first quarter of 2017. Note that in the first quarter of last year, we recognized a $13.4 million non-cash charge related to the early redemption of our Series F preferred stock. As a reminder, our reported FFO does follow the NAREIT redefined FFO definitions. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was also $0.79 per share for the quarter, representing a 3.9% increase. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In early April, we issued $500 million in seven-year fixed rate unsecured bonds at a yield of 3.96%. The offering allowed us to term out our borrowings on our revolving credit facility and they fit nicely in our debt maturity schedule as we had no other maturities in 2025. Pro forma for the bond offering, the weighted average maturity of our bond is approximately 9.5 years, which is nearly three years longer than it was at the start of 2017. Our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with less than $80 million of debt coming due the remainder of this year and only $21 million coming due in 2019 outside of our revolver and our maturity schedule is very well latter thereafter. Our overall leverage remains modest. Our pro forma debt to EBITDA, assuming the annualized impact of our first quarter acquisitions, is currently 5.6 times and our fixed charge coverage remains healthy at 4.6 times. So, in summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and strong coverage metrics. Now, let me turn the call back over to John.
John Case: Thanks, Paul. I’ll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. As I mentioned earlier, occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.6%, an increase of 30 basis points versus the year ago period. We expect occupancy to be just north of 98% for 2018. During the quarter, we re-leased 55 properties, recapturing just over 100% of the expiring rent, which is consistent with our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold nearly 2700 properties with leases expiring, recapturing 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Going to dispositions, we continue to selectively sell properties that no longer meet our investment criteria. During the quarter, we sold $14 million of non-strategic assets, achieving an unlevered IRR of 7.3% and a cap rate or leased property sales of 6.6%. We’re increasing in our estimate for dispositions from $75 million to $100 million to approximately $200 million for 2018. Our same store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter, which is consistent with our projected run rate for 2018. Approximately 90% of our leases continue to have contractual rent increases. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant and history, geography and to a certain extent property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties re-leased to 254 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 81% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.7% of rental revenue and in the first quarter, drugstores was our largest industry at 10.5% of rental revenue. We're pleased with the strength of our portfolio, which continues to perform well, especially relative to other types of retail portfolios, which had faced more significant challenges due to e-commerce pressures. Within our retail portfolio, over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate successfully in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent US retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. This represents the highest investment grade exposure in our portfolio’s history. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for retail properties is 2.8 times on a four wall basis, while the median is 2.6 times. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is also consistent with our levels of the last few years. Moving on to acquisitions, we completed $510 million in acquisitions during the quarter at a 6.2% cap rate. Virtually, all in the QSR and C-store industries. As a reminder, we disclose cash cap rates as opposed to GAAP cap rates. We estimate our GAAP acquisition cap rates would be about 0.5% higher. We were pleased with the quality of our first quarter acquisitions as 85% of the rental revenue generated from these investments is from investment grade rated tenants. During the quarter, we completed a significant sale leaseback transaction with 7-Eleven who is now our fifth largest tenant, representing approximately 3.5% of rent. 7-Eleven is the top global convenience store operator and provides very strong credit with an S&P rating of AA-. We previously partnered with 7-Eleven for their first sale leaseback transaction in 2016 and are pleased to continue the relationship. This transaction was done on a off-market basis and reflects the benefits afforded to us due to our size, as we are the only net lease REIT able to execute on an investment of this scale without creating tenant and history concentration issues. These properties are newer vintage and located in highly trafficked markets with significant population density. The average size of these properties is in excess of 4000 square feet and about two-thirds of the properties operate a quick service restaurant concept within the convenience store. In addition to the quality of the real estate, we are pleased with the structure of this transaction, which carries an average lease term of 16 years and rent growth well in excess of our portfolio average with rents in lined with market rents. Overall, we continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced 9.5 billion in acquisition opportunities. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring 5% of the amount sourced. Our investment spreads in the first quarter move closer to our historical average as a result of the high quality of the properties and the strong credit profile of the tenants as well as higher capital costs. Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline in the current market environment, we continue to estimate 2018 acquisition volume to be $1 billion to $1.5 billion. I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions in a bit more detail now. Sumit?
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John. During the first quarter of 2018, we invested 510 million in 174 properties located in 27 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 14 years. On revenue basis, approximately 85% of the total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 100% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 16 different tenants in 12 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are convenience stores and quick service restaurants. We closed 10 discrete transactions in the first quarter. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy of the opportunity source during the first quarter, 54% for portfolios and 46% or approximately 4.4 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 23% for the first quarter. Of the 510 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, 5% were one-off transactions. As to pricing cap rates, we’re essentially unchanged in the first quarter. Investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy, averaging approximately 130 basis points in the first quarter, which were just under our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as an initial cash yield, less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. As John mentioned, during the quarter, we sold 14 properties for net proceeds of 13.8 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.3%. In conclusion, we look forward to achieving our 2018 acquisition target and revise disposition volume of approximately 200 million. John?
John Case: We continue to monitor the capital markets to fund our business. The pricing of our April bond offering, which Paul referenced reflects the benefits of having the highest credit rating in the net lease sector. We're well positioned to fund our growth for the remainder of the year as a result of our conservative balance sheet management over recent years. We have no bond maturities until 2021 and our senior unsecured notes and bonds have a weighted average remaining term of approximately 9.5 years. We currently have about $1.3 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. In March, we increased the dividend for the 96th time in our company’s history. Our current annualized dividend represents a 4% increase over the year ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of 4.7%. We’re proud to be one of only five REITs in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index.  To wrap it up, we are pleased with our company's performance to start the year and remain optimistic for the remainder of 2018. Our real estate portfolio, acquisitions pipeline and balance sheet remain healthy, contributing to favorable risk adjusted earnings growth for our shareholders. At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question now from Nick Yulico with UBS.
Nick Yulico: I guess first off, just a question on the disposition guidance going up. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're looking to sell?
John Case: Sure. Just like last year, when initially we guided the dispositions for the year, 75 million to 100 million, we did the same thing this year, but as the year goes along, we uncover opportunities to sell non-strategic assets and we've had a couple of conversations that have led us to believe we think we're going to be closer to 200 million in dispositions. The types of assets are non-strategic. There's a casual dining portfolio included in that and some additional Piazzi stores and a few other types, but they're largely non-strategic and they're factored in to our guidance, even though they're a bit dilutive.
Nick Yulico: Okay. And then second question is on industrial. You've previously talked about looking to grow that exposure. I'm wondering how much of the pipeline build as you looked at in the first quarter was industrial and with the M&A that's happened in that sector of late, how is the pricing there for us that's been affected, affecting your ability to still be able to buy industrial? Can you make deals work versus where you see your cost of capital?
John Case: Yeah. That's a good question, Nick. About 20% of the transactions we sourced in the first quarter were industrial properties and even though the 10-year treasury has risen by 50 basis points this year more or less, we've seen industrial cap rates continue to tick down by roughly 25 basis points. So it's been quite challenging for us to grow that part of the business and that's why none of our acquisitions in the first quarter were industrial properties. That being said, given the activity in that sector, it does reinforce the views we have regarding the strength of that portfolio, just under $3 billion on our balance sheet. So we're pleased to have it, but at these pricing levels, it would be challenging to grow significantly, given our current cost of capital.
Operator: We’ll move and take our next question from Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.
Karin Ford: You’ve talked about how you could fund your investment guidance with cash flow, leverage capacity and dispositions. You’re off to a fast start here, it sounds like the pipeline is good. How are you thinking about expanding that guidance and using the ATM and/or equity issuance now you’re once again trading above NAV?
John Case: Well, Karin, the acquisitions are lumpy. So that's the word we've used to describe them. We've quarters at 700 to 800 million and quarters at 200 million to 300 million. We can't really extrapolate of one quarter and that's what we did change our guidance for acquisitions. We’re still guiding to 1 billion to 1.5 billion for the year at this point. As far as capital raising, yes, we could fund our growth this year. Our estimated growth without coming to the equity markets through disposition proceeds, routine cash flow and debt, the balance sheet is in great shape right now. However, we will look at all capital opportunities, including equity and when we need to raise capital, we will use the appropriate form in the form that makes the most sense for the company.
Karin Ford: My second question is going back to the M&A question earlier. Do you think that the Gramercy deal earlier this week was driven by the unique aspects of GPT’s industrial real estate or do you take anything away with respect to the privatization prospects for triple net real estate generally.
John Case: Well, I think industrial was the flavor of the day. We've seen a lot of competition for those types of properties. I think Gramercy did a good job, I know, Gordon, we know Gordon well, solid company. We competed frequently with them, winning our fair share and losing some on property acquisitions. They put together a nice portfolio just as we have. I think that the Blackstone transaction is driven more by the fact that Gramercy is industrial rather than you it's a net least company. I think that addresses your question.
Operator: And next, we’ll move on to Nick Joseph with Citi.
Michael Bilerman: It’s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. So just, if I think about G&A load, the last call it four years or so, you’ve consistently run at this sort of 5% of revenue line in terms of G&A relative to revenues and your asset base has grown almost $5 billion over that time. How should investors think about, at what point you may or maybe you won't ever see further G&A leverage within the organization, as you continue to put out capital every year.
John Case: Yeah. So, we have held at 5%, which we've been pleased with in terms of G&A as a percent of revenues. I think we'll be able to hold that level for the foreseeable future and perhaps bring it down a bit more. Paul, you want to elaborate on that?
Paul Meurer: Yeah. Some of the additions of personnel over the past couple of years as we enter new property types and expanded the portfolio were necessary and we've invested in, I think, personnel and systems, which put us in good position to kind of support continued growth of the company without significant additions on the G&A side. So we're feeling kind of that curve coming, where I think a little bit more leverage will occur and we could see that number ticked down. Yes, for this year though and the near term is still around 5%.
Michael Bilerman: How do you think about the right organizational structure for a net lease company? I think with Mark's announcement, have a CEO, President, and COO, CIO, a Chief Strategy Officer, I guess it’s going to be a CSO, CFO, and then a number of Executive Vice Presidents that feed into that. Just from the -- I recognize you’re a big company. It just seems like a lot of heads for a net lease company in their senior suite where you haven't been able to get that G&A leverage as you've grown pretty meaningfully.
Paul Meurer: Well, we've got the lowest in the sector and over time, it has come down and we probably hear more comments as to why don't you continue to broaden your skill set and deepen your skillset, given the efficiency of the company. We don't have any positions right now that are not critical positions to the management of the company. So with Mark’s addition, I think we'll be in a place where we've got our full complement of skillsets and it will be, I think, we'll be taking care of at the executive and any level following that. I’d cite that most of our peers I think are closer to 10% in terms of G&A load as a percent of revenues.
Operator: Next, we’ll move on to Jason Belcher with Wells Fargo.
Jason Belcher: Hi. Just wanted to ask about this headline I saw this morning about Sears partnering with Amazon to sell and install car tires, it’s another retail sector that I think most people yesterday would have felt was fairly well insulated from pressures of online retail. Just wondering is this something that you've heard anything about from your auto parts and service tenants, something they’ve sort of seen coming down the line or would this be more in the unexpected disruption bucket? And then if you could just remind us what your exposure is to the auto parts and service sectors please?
John Case: Yeah. So to the tire services sector, 2.4% of our rental revenues are represented by tires, the tire service. And then on top of that, we have about another 4% in automotive parts and automotive service and that's an area we've been fine with. We haven't received any immediate feedback from our clients on the Sears transaction as of yet, but that's a business that we like and that certainly is benefits from the trend of automobile miles driven continuing to increase in this country. So all vehicles will need tires, regardless of whether they're gas or EDV. Sumitomo is the parent of TBC and is a very strong company with an A- rating and stands behind those leases for TBC.
Operator: And next we’ll move on to Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra: I just wanted to dig in a bit more on the new position announced in the terms of the Chief Strategy Officer. I believe this is the first time you've sort of created this role. So I’m wondering if you can give us a sense of what his role would be and does this signal perhaps you looking at this sector viewer exposed to maybe in a different matter to changing the strategy say for over the next ten years, does it signal you looking at potentially bigger portfolios or maybe even strategic M&A?
John Case: Well, it doesn't change our strategy. We believe that as the company has grown in size to be a $21 billion company with 5300 properties in 47 different industries, 49 states that it made sense to have a -- we've become more complex as well, but it made sense to have a executive level position dedicated to strategy. We'll continue to oversee our research and credit effort and continue to sit on the investment community and Neil’s background is very well suited for this position. He'll work with the rest of the executive team, me and the board in formulating strategy going forward and I think it will be a more efficient process. So we're glad to have Neil in that role and he will do well, given the successes he had in the Chief Investment Officer role, but it does not signal any change in strategy for us. It's just a response to the growth we've had and that increasing diversification of our portfolio that we've had since 2010 when we were just a $4.5 billion company and today, we're $21 billion company.
Vikram Malhotra: And just in terms of sort of the portfolio itself, you do have the concentration now in two main sectors, convenience stores and drugstores, maybe just give us some thoughts of where you'd like that to be over the next few years.
John Case: Well, we're comfortable having strong sectors such as those be in that low double digit percentage of rent range. So, next quarter, we'll see C-stores, drugstores would be somewhere around 11% of rental revenues. We're comfortable with those levels. That being said, at times, we opportunistically sell some of the tenants within those categories, properties, when we have strong bids and that's a very liquid market for assets in those two industries and we often acquire a large sale leaseback transactions and did a 25 to 75 basis point cap rate, higher than what you see in the one-off market. So it's a good way for us to drive value, raise money and manage exposure, but we're comfortable with those levels, given the strength of those industries.
Operator: Next, we’ll move on to John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.
John Massocca: Given the increase in the disposition guidance and the fact that you expected to be maybe more strategic, generally speaking, what would you expect the mix on dispositions to be this year between vacant and occupied assets?
Sumit Roy: In the first quarter, it was – of the 13 assets, three were occupied, 10 were vacant. I do see a shift in that in order for us to get to the 200 million as John alluded. We are having discussions on the casual dining side and a vast majority of those are going to be occupied assets.
John Massocca: And then it’s a little bit of a blast in the past, but can you give us a quick update on the former Gander assets, did you sell any of these properties in 1Q 18 or leasing of them?
John Case: Sure. So we owned initially -- I think it was nine Ganders and they represented less than 0.5% of our revenues. So it wasn't a significant tenant for us. At this point, we resolved six of the nine, three were re-leased at recapture rates just under 90%, the expiring rent. So we were pleased with those and then we are selling, have sold and have under contract to sell three more properties and then the remaining three we're in discussions on in terms of leasing with national and regional tenants. So that's where we stand on that and we're pleased with the outcome so far.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income’s conference. I will now turn the call back over to John Case for concluding remarks.
John Case: Okay. Well, thank you. We appreciate everyone joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you in a few weeks at ICSC and NAREIT. Thanks again for joining the call.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our conference call for today, everyone. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q4  (2018-02-22 13:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the VEREIT Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bonni Rosen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Bonni Rosen: Thank you for joining us today for the VEREIT 2017 fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Rufrano, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Bartolotta, our Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call is being webcast on our website at vereit.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at approximately 2:00 PM Eastern Time today. Dial-in for the replay is 1-877-344-7529 with the confirmation code of 10116308. Before I turn the call over to Glenn, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements in this earnings call, which are not historical facts, will be forward-looking. VEREIT’s actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC filings, including the yearly report filed today. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports, VEREIT disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by law. Let me quickly review the format of today’s call. First, Glenn will begin by providing a business and operational update, followed by Mike presenting our quarterly and year-end financial results. Glenn will then discuss 2018 guidance and we will conclude today’s call by opening the line for questions. Glenn, let me turn the call over to you.
Glenn Rufrano: Thanks, Bonni, and thanks for joining our call. For the year, we met or exceeded the core components of our 2017 targets. We hit the high-end of our AFFO guidance range, with the real estate components at $0.70. Acquisitions totaled $746 million and we completed $575 million of dispositions. Our balance sheet is strong. We improved our maturity schedule and our net debt to normalized EBITDA is 5.7 times providing capacity. We received an investment grade rating for the company from S&P and Moody’s and along with Fitch, all three rating agencies have us had investment grade. And after reestablishing the brand of Cole Capital, we announced the sale simplifying our business model. We’re pleased with the operations for the year with occupancy ending at 98.8%. Same-store rent was flat, which includes 0.3% due to the impact of our early lease renewal efforts. In 2017, we had 2.5 million square feet of leasing activity, of which 1.5 million square feet were early renewals. Notable transactions included 1.1 million square feet of office and industrial leases and 92,000 square feet of bank branches. Of the early renewals, we recaptured 91% of the prior rents. These leases have built in increases and we have extended the weighted average lease maturity to 11.6 years. For the 2017 renewals, we recaptured 99% of prior rent, with additional rent increases over the lease term. Our portfolio diversification was further enhanced, as we implemented our calling process. At year-end, property tax diversification was 41% retail, 22% restaurants, 17% industrial, and office just under 20%. As you can see, we are within our target range of 15% to 20% for office, and Red Lobster was reduced to 6.5%, which is down from 12% when we first initiated our business plan. Our top 10 tenants represent 28.3%, which is among the lowest concentration in the industry. We have a number of long-term diversification guidelines, no tenant greater than 5%, no industry or geography greater than 10%, investment grade tenants between 30% and 40%, and weighted average lease terms approximately 10 years. 2017 total commercial real estate transactions in the U.S. were $481 billion, down from $512 billion in 2016. Yet, we found our pipeline of transaction continued on pace with $22 billion of real estate offered to us. With that as a background, we purchased $294 million of assets during the fourth quarter, bringing 2,017 acquisitions to $746 million. Our program focused on retail and industrial credits with long-term business plans to manage through the current secular trends. Our retail focus continues to be off-price in e-commerce resistant sectors represented by tenants such as Hobby Lobby, LAFitness and Tractor Supply. As well as brands, we believe will continue to provide value to customers long-term, such as Bass Pro Cabela’s. Our industrial criteria emphasizes location, functionality and appropriate tenancy as represented by Best Buy and Michaels distribution centers. $86 million of our assets were sold in the fourth quarter, bringing the total for 2017 to $575 million. These continue to be very targeted to our diversifiers, Red Lobster and office in addition to non-core. For the year, our sales provided a gain of $65 million. And since our business plan in 2015, we have sold $3.2 billion of a gain of $206 million. As reported, we completed the sale of Cole on February 1. With the reestablishment of the brand, the sale itself is based on the changing industry and our ability to simplify our business plan, our business model with more straightforward reporting, streamlined operating process, less fiduciary responsibility and a more predictable set of financial expectations. Before Mike reviews our financial results, let me provide a brief update on litigation. The Court held a conference in December to discuss depositions, which started after the 1st of this year and could last through the year. The Court scheduled the next Status Conference for June 11, 2018. Additional details regarding pending litigations can be found in our 10-K filed today. Let me now turn over the call to Mike.
Michael Bartolotta: Thanks, Glenn, and thank you all for joining us today. Now with the sale of Cole has been accomplished, we will have more simplified financial reporting, and you will see our main real estate operations as continuing operations and Cole as discontinued operations. We finished the year on plan achieving AFFO of $0.74 per diluted share with $0.70 coming from continuing operations. As we outlined in our earnings release, we will focus on continuing operations for this call. In the fourth quarter, revenue increased $10.1 million to $316.6 million as we moved to being a net acquirer. The net loss was $2.5 million versus net income of $12.5 million last quarter. The $15 million decrease was mostly the result of higher impairment charges, G&A and appreciation along with our Q4 loss on the extinguishment of debt versus a gain in Q3. These were partially offset by higher revenue and a gain on the disposition of real estate in Q4. FFO and AFFO per diluted share were roughly flat for the quarter at $0.17 and $0.18, respectively, in each period. G&A was up $5.1 million to $18.3 million versus $13.2 million for the third quarter, mostly due to year-end compensation-related items. Full-year G&A was $58.6 million and we expect G&A for 2018 to be between $65 million and $68 million. The increase is predominantly due to cost previously included in the Cole Capital segment of which approximately 50% represents equity compensation. Recurring CapEx was $21.7 million for the year, which was lower than our anticipated range of $30 million to $35 million. Some of the capital spend will spill over into 2018. Given the spillover, our 2018 estimate for recurring CapEx is $30 million to $35 million. The average of the 2016 to 2018 CapEx is about $20 million to $25 million. Legal costs related to the matters arising from the audit committee investigation, which are included in litigation and other non-routine costs were approximately $12.9 million for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date amount of $49.4 million. Our estimate for 2018 gross legal cost is $55 million to $65 million, excluding any insurance proceeds. Turning to our fourth quarter real estate activity, the company purchased 23 properties for $293.5 million at an average cash cap rate of 6.8%. Acquisitions totaled $745.6 million for the year at an average cash cap rate of 6.9%. Subsequent to the quarter, the company purchased six properties for $66.3 million at an average cash cap rate of 6.9%. During the quarter, we disposed of 25 properties and a land parcel owned by an unconsolidated joint venture for $85.6 million, at an average cash cap rate of 7.6%, which included a number of non-core office properties. Dispositions totaled $574.9 million for the year at an average cash cap rate of 7.1%. And subsequent to the quarter, the company disposed the seven properties for an aggregate sales price of $57.4 million, at an average cash cap rate of 7%. In addition, we have $22 million bank portfolio under our contract. We have continued to strengthen the balance sheet and the maturity schedule. In August, we issued $600 million of 3.95% 10-year bonds at an issue price of 99.33% of par value. Proceeds from this offering were used to redeem our $500 million term loan and the remaining proceeds were used to repay secured debt. This further laddered our maturity schedule and extended our duration. As of the end of the year, we had drawn $185 million on our revolving line of credit leaving $2.1 billion of capacity. We will continue to use our line of credit as part of our capital allocation strategy. And during the fourth quarter, we reduced secured debt by $31.6 million. We paid down $579.9 million of secured debt for the year. Any secured debt coming due in 2018 is expected to eventually be termed out with unsecured debt. Our net debt to normalized EBITDA was 5.7 times, up slightly from 5.5 times in Q3. Our fixed charge coverage ratio remained healthy at 3.1 times and our net debt to gross real estate investments ratio was 39%. Our unencumbered asset ratio was 73% and the weighted average duration of our debt was 4.3 years. And with that, I’ll turn the call back to Glenn.
Glenn Rufrano: Thanks, Mike. I’ll now turn to guidance for 2018. AFFO per share between $0.70 and $0.72; net debt to EBITDA of approximately 6 times; real estate operations with average occupancy about 98%; the same-store rental growth ranging from 0.3% to 1%; dispositions totaling $300 million to $500 million; and cap rate ranging from 6.5 to 7.5, targeting our continued diversification categories, restaurant, office as well as non-core. Acquisition guidance is $200 million to $300 million in excess of dispositions funded through a combination of internal equity, debt capacity and proceeds from the sale of Cole. Properties are expected to be in the cap rate range of 6.5 to 7.5 and will be considered based upon their portfolio enhancing qualities. Our acquisition program within the balance sheet guidelines and the $200 million authorized share repurchase plan could be interchangeable with respect to real estate assets or the company stock. We’re in a period where capital market conditions are causing volatility in REITsharesin the face of generally good economic and market fundamentals. Over the past three years, the market has been more stable and we have taken advantage of that stability to reinforce our portfolio, strengthen and make more liquid our balance sheet and with the sale of Cole simplify the business. Our talented management team has experienced through various market cycles and we’ll continue to focus on our business objectives. I’ve now been here three years, and I’m committed to continue the progress we’ve made and as such, have renewed my contract for an additional three years. With that, we’ll open the phone to Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Sheila McGrath of Evercore.
Sheila McGrath: Yes, good afternoon. Glenn, your share still traded at meaningful discount to the net lease sector. Cole Capital was a major move to help simplify VEREIT. What is – what other levers do you think VEREIT has to pull to close the discount?
Glenn Rufrano: Well, Sheila, we – as you certainly understood following us, we had a number of impediments as we started building the company back to where it is today. And we have one left litigation and we understand and know that causes some discount. We’ve operated well in the last three years. As a company, you can only manage litigation and we are managing the litigation. Our goal is to continue to operate well, continue to prove that we have improved the portfolio. We have acquisition capabilities and run the portfolio well. If we do that, we will be rewarded. What we will not do is something stupid that I will guarantee you.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, great. And then I know you’re very limited on what you can say on litigation, but you mentioned the date June 11. I was wondering, if you could tell – remind us or give us a little more detail what that is? And also how we should think about insurance covering litigation costs in 2018?
Glenn Rufrano: The – it’s just a reference point for the folks to get back together. As we mentioned, we initiated depositions and it would be a Status Conference primarily dedicated to that. That’s what the June date is all about, Sheila. In terms of insurance, we continue to work with insurance. We have – had a lawsuit, which is preventing insurance to be paid right now. We do expect that to be settled at a reasonable – in a reasonable timeframe.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, great. Thank you.
Glenn Rufrano: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Joshua Dennerlein: Hey, good evening, everyone.
Glenn Rufrano: Hi.
Joshua Dennerlein: I’m curious about your plans for the 2018 convertible notes and also that notes coming due in 2019 and where you think you could issue 10-year debt today?
Michael Bartolotta: Sure, Josh, it’s Mike. I mean, we – if you take a look at what we have over the next two years, we now have $185 million outside on the line, and that line technically comes due 6/30 of 2018 with a one-year extension capability. We’ve got $597 million of those 3% converts that come due in August 1st of 2018 and then we have the $750 million of the 3% unsecured notes that mature on – in February of 2019. What we’re currently doing is working with our banking group. And obviously, one of the things we can do is renew our line and have the $2.3 billion revolver there available to help absorb some of this. And obviously, we have no problem going back out to the debt markets to issue notes. I think today if we were to issue notes, we would be somewhere in the neighborhood of roughly 4.6% to 4.7% on the 10-year and something less on the less – on something less as far as that goes. I think, we will probably be working with our banks potentially to do our recap. And as we were to do a recap, that would allow us in our likelihood to do a deferred draw that would allow us to take care of the first convertible note coming due in 2018. And we would then work with our banks, as well as the market to see what we wanted to do with the February 19 that towards the end of this year.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay.
Glenn Rufrano: And as you know, you could see in the summer, Mike and his team recapped $600 million. I think piteously, we beat some of this increase to free up this line that makes this next financing much easier.
Joshua Dennerlein: Got it. Thanks, guys. That’s it for me.
Glenn Rufrano: Thank you.
Operator: And next, we have a follow-up question from Sheila McGrath.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. Just in terms of stock buyback and capital allocation towards acquisitions, if you could just give us a little bit of insight on how you’re thinking about acquisitions versus buyback?
Glenn Rufrano: Sure. First, Sheila, we in May of this year announced $200 million of buyback as you remember, and we watched the markets very closely and we bought about 69,000 shares, not much. I think that was good. As we look at our stock today, we understand the discount. We see the cost of capital in the market versus the cost of capital in buying shares. We’re very analytical in that process. And we will use the appropriate risk return relationship to consider both acquisitions stock or assets. The difference though I would point out is, we are always looking to improve our portfolio. So an asset acquisition has to improve the portfolio, where a stock acquisition may be a better risk, but we are going to be looking towards debt. We are not going to move out of our debt guidance either – in either buying stock and/or assets.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. That’s helpful. And then most of your acquisitions, I think, recently have been more retail and industrial-oriented. Just your thoughts on the office portfolio longer-term with this, do you think this would ever be considered non-core, and you would divest office, or just your long-term thoughts on office?
Glenn Rufrano: Sure. But to your point, you’re right, Sheila, for the year, we bought the $746 million, 57% was retail, 43% was industrial. So those were the two property types that we purchased. We are continuing to take down our office portfolio, we’re about 19.6, and we’ll take it down a bit more, because we want to be within guidelines, which we think makes sense. In terms of the total diversification of the company, we do believe in diversification. We do believe that having different property types can make sense. And it can make sense, because not only are you diversifying risk, you provide the opportunity at the appropriate time to buy the right property type. So as of now, we’re not considering exiting the office market. We’re considering bringing it down somewhat. But at some point, it may provide an opportunity for us. And we’ve continually said, we’re not smart enough to know at any given time, which property type is in or out. And in our business, our business model, which is to provide equity to corporate America, we have the infrastructure to manage and lease all four of these property types that infrastructure value is important to us and we will continue consider diversification.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. And one last question. Just on the Cole disposition, I think, it was meaningful in terms of simplifying VEREIT. I’m just wondering if you could give us like longer-term after all the moving pieces are gone. Incrementally, will that sale have a positive impact on G&A for VEREIT before and after Cole if we kind of compare?
Glenn Rufrano: Sure. I’ll let Mike start that.
Michael Bartolotta: Sure. I mean, I think, we’ve indicated just now that our increase in G&A that we mentioned of about $8 million is due to the Cole transaction. We will – even now with that increase of – which puts us in a range of $66 million in G&A. We have about 4% of our assets in G&A and about 5.3% of our revenue. And that’s compared to a peer group of about 0.5% and about 6.7%. That being said, we were never going to be comfortable with having the large increase in G&A, and we will always work towards having the most efficient operation. It’s hard to tell today given that we just disclosed the transaction where we come out beyond 2019.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. Thank you.
Glenn Rufrano: Thank you.
Operator: And next, we have a question from Chris Lucas of Capital One.
Chris Lucas: Good afternoon, everybody. Hey, Glenn, I think, initially, when you laid out your sort of plan for the company when you joined, one of the items that you were looking at was eliminating flat leases as part of the portfolio, or at least reducing that. You’re still at 21% of ABR and flat leases. what’s the thought on your exposure there? is that – I know that’s – a lot of that relates to sort of investment grade-rated tenants? But just curious as to how you think about that pool of assets relative to the overall portfolio?
Glenn Rufrano: We have tried hard for it. We were at 25%. We’re now down to 21%. And just to give you a sense, we had sold $715 million of flat leases since we started. But we’re working with denominator effects here. And that’s the reason it hasn’t come down as much as we’d like. We want to be in that range. But your other point is important, because a good question would be, why have any? Frankly, we’d like to have none, but we are always matching investment grade. So we’ll match the two. But for our balance sheet, as we said right in the beginning in our business plan, we’d rather take a flat lease, sell it at good price and put that money back into the balance sheet to work, and that’s still our position and we’re going to bring it down to that 15% to 20% range.
Chris Lucas: Okay, thanks. And then going back to the question that Sheila asked, as it relates to sort of the transition with Cole, I guess, the question I have is that, so the sale closes mid-quarter going forward the rest of the year for the quarterly results. Are there transition overhangs as it relates to G&A that we should be thinking about, or other sort of dual efforts that sort of inflate the current expectations for G&A relative to sort of what the clean run rate will look like going forward in 2019 and beyond?
Michael Bartolotta: I’ll start that one. Basically, Chris, it’s the $8 million. I think, if you want to think about overhang, it’s roughly that $8 million that I mentioned that is the increase over the existing run rate of G&A for the continuing operations. That that’s the overhang that we have right now that we’ll need to deal with as as we move forward.
Glenn Rufrano: And, Chris, the part of the transition agreement allows us as we’re moving to lower people count. It allows us to reduce any other slippage. That number is the primary number that we’ll be working towards to reduce.
Chris Lucas: Okay, great. Thank you.
Glenn Rufrano: Thank you.
Operator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Glenn Rufrano for any closing remarks.
Glenn Rufrano: We thank, everybody, for joining us today, and look forward to another good year. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Janeen Bedard, Vice President. Please go ahead.
Janeen Bedard: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income’s third quarter 2017 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that maybe considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company’s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.
John Case: Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We are pleased to report another solid quarter with AFFO per share growth of approximately 7%. During the quarter, we completed $265 million of high quality acquisitions, while strengthening our balance sheet raising $444 million in common equity. We ended the quarter with a fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.7 times, which is the highest it’s been in our company’s history. Given our active investment pipeline, we continued to expect to acquire approximately $1.5 billion in acquisitions this year. We are also reiterating our 2017 AFFO per share guidance of $3.03 to $3.07, which represents annual growth of 5.2% to 6.6%. Now, let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results.
Paul Meurer: Thanks, John. I will provide some highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Interest expense increased in the quarter by $10 million to $63 million. This increase was primarily due to a higher outstanding debt balance in the third quarter, following our March issuance of $700 million of long-term unsecured bonds as well as a smaller gain on our interest rate swaps recognized this quarter as compared to that quarter last year. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 4.7% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date, which is in line with our full year projection. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues are 1.8% in the quarter and our guidance remains 1.5% to 2% for all of 2017. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.77 for the quarter versus $0.73 a year ago. Our 2017 FFO guidance remains $2.96 to $3.01 per share. As a reminder, our reported FFO follows the NAREIT defined FFO definition, which includes various non-cash items such as quarterly interest rate swaps, gains or losses, amortization of lease intangibles and the $0.05 charge we incurred in connection with the redemption for our Series F preferred stock back in April. This $0.05 preferred stock redemption charge is the primary difference in our FFO and AFFO guidance. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.77 per share for the quarter, representing a 6.9% increase over the year ago period. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. During the quarter, we raised $444 million in equity primarily through our ATM program. Our senior unsecured bonds have a weighted average remaining maturity of 7.9 years and our fixed charge coverage ratio is 4.7 times. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have on just $23 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $1.3 million of debt coming due, the remainder of this year and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. Finally, our overall leverage remains modest with our debt to EBITDA ratio standing at 5.2 times. In summary, we continue to have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. Now, let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on these results.
John Case: Thanks, Paul. I will begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3% unchanged versus the year ago period. We continue to expect occupancy to be at or above 98% in 2017. During the quarter, we re-leased 79 properties recapturing approximately 104% of the expiring rent, which is notably above our long-term average. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of leasing recapture rates above 100%. Year-to-date, we re-leased 181 properties, recapturing approximately 107% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 2,500 properties, with leases expiring, recapturing over 99% of rent on those properties that will re-lease. Our recapture rates reflect net effective rents as we seldom incur tenant improvements and leasing commissions. This compares favorably to those companies in our sector who also report this metric. Our same-store rent increased 1% during the quarter and for the year-to-date period, which is consistent with our projected run-rate for 2017. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 251 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 80% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial at about 13% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenue and drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.8% of rental revenue. We remain confident in the drugstore industry and speaking in 2010, the number of mail order prescriptions has declined each year and that has coincided with Walgreens positive pharmacy same-store sales growth for 18 consecutive quarters within our retail portfolio over 90% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to compete more effectively with e-commerce and operate in a variety of economic environments. These factors have been particularly relevant in today’s retail climate, where the vast majority of U.S. retailer bankruptcies this year have been in industries that do not have these characteristics. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio, with 46% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. Store level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound, both the median and weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties, 2.7 times on a four-walled basis. Our watch list remains in the low 1% range as a percentage of rent, which is consistent with our levels of the last few years. Moving on to acquisitions, we completed $265 million of acquisitions during the quarter at near record investment spreads. We continue to see a steady flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $6.7 billion in acquisition opportunities bringing us to $24.3 billion sourced year-to-date. We remain selective in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 4% of the amount we have sourced. Our low cost of capital allows us to acquire the highest quality properties that provide favorable long-term returns, while also creating meaningful near-term earnings growth. Given the continued strength in our investment pipeline, we are reiterating our 2017 acquisitions guidance of approximately $1.5 billion. Now, I will hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John. During the third quarter of 2017, we invested $265 million in 56 properties located in 16 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.2 years. On a revenue basis, approximately 10% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 100% of the revenues are generated from retail. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 10 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are theaters, automotive services, and quick-service restaurants. We closed 13 discrete transactions in the third quarter. Year-to-date 2017, we invested $957 million in 177 properties located in 35 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. On a revenue basis, 39% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 97% of the revenues are generated from retail and 3% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 47 different tenants in 21 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are grocery stores, theaters and automotive services. Of the 50 independent transactions closed year-to-date, 3 transactions were about $50 million. With regard to transaction flow, it continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $7 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have sourced approximately $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 49% of the volume sourced, were portfolios and 51% or approximately $12 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 40% for the third quarter. Of the $265 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 19% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 48-year operating history. As to pricing, cap rates continued to remain flat in the third quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital remained healthy averaging 263 basis points in the third quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield that’s our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Regarding dispositions, during the third quarter, we sold 17 properties for net proceeds of $25.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an un-levered IRR of 13.6%. This brings us to 45 properties sold year-to-date to $69 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8% and realized an un-levered IRR of 10.9%. In conclusion, we remain confident in reaching a 2017 acquisition target of approximately $1.5 billion and disposition volume between $125 million and $175 million. With that, I would like to hand it back to John.
John Case: Thanks, Sumit. We were active on the capital markets front in the third quarter issuing approximately $444 million in common equity at an average price to investors of approximately $58 per share. Our equity issuance activity during the quarter came through our ATM program of cost – this is a cost effective equity issuance allowed us to match fund our acquisitions activity and to prepay $175 million of our bonds that matured in September. We currently have approximately $1.3 billion available on our $2 billion line of credit. This provides us with the ample liquidity and flexibility as we grow our company. Last month, we increased the dividend for the 93rd time in the company’s history. Our dividends year-to-date represent a 6% increase over the year ago period. We have increased our dividend every year since the company’s listing in 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. We are proud to be one of only 5 REITs, S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. Our dividend represents an AFFO payout ratio of 83% based on the midpoint of our 2017 guidance. To wrap it up, we are pleased with our company’s financial position and operating performance and remain confident in the outlook for our business. Our real estate portfolio is performing well. Our acquisition pipeline is robust. Our balance sheet is conservatively capitalized. Our cost of capital remains a competitive advantage, we believe allows us to continue generating favorable risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from R.J. Milligan with Baird.
R.J. Milligan: Hey, good afternoon guys. Couple of quick questions. John, you mentioned the ATM issuance this quarter, I was just curious if you recall had some comments on sort of the thought process on issuing such a large amount on the ATM and whether or not you have changed the strategy or adjusted the strategy going forward in terms of match funding the acquisitions versus overnight offerings?
John Case: RJ, that’s good question. In the third quarter, we had an opportunity under favorable market conditions to match fund acquisitions and debt maturities. We were also able to save the shareholders about $17 million relative to what we would have had to pay in order to do an overnight offering. So, it worked out particularly well. Going forward, we will consider all forms of equity raising, so whether it be a regular way overnight offering, a marketed offering or additional ATM issuance activity. This was a heavy quarter for us on the ATM. We had, I’d say, half of it was raised through regularly trading and about half of it was raised through reverse inquiry from high-quality institutional investors. So, we were pleased with the pricing. For the quarter, it was about $58 on a gross basis and it worked out well for us, but we will continue to look at all equity raising alternatives in the future.
R.J. Milligan: Great, thanks. And then it looks like in the quarter on the acquisition side, you guys added to your AMC exposure and given some of the weakness that we have seen in the equity at AMC, just curious how you guys got comfortable with increasing your investment within theaters and within AMC specifically?
John Case: Right. So, the equity performance is a bit divorced from the performance of our theaters. So, we are aware that the AMC stock has not traded well recently, but our properties and our theaters are performing quite well. We like the experiential nature of the theater business, and in particular, AMCs. It continues to be a low cost form of entertainment. As you know, the theaters have continued to upgrade their offerings with more comfortable seating and better technology and the full-service, higher quality food and beverage offerings. And as a result, they are seeing a rise in revenue. 2016 was a record year at the box office for the theater industry. So, it’s tough comp year. Year-to-date, we are off about 5% from where we were at this time last year in terms of box office, but most industry experts believe we are going to see a strong fourth quarter as a number of big blockbusters such as Star Wars are released during the holiday. So, they expect the underperformance this year to turn a little bit and become a bit more favorable, but we are very happy with our theaters. The vast majority of our AMCs have been retrofitted with better seating, better technology and again, food and beverage offerings. So, where that’s been done we have seen a 64% increase in revenues versus the pre-reconfiguration revenues for those AMCs. So it really comes down to picking the right properties having strong underwriting structures and we are pleased with that.
Operator: We will take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi.
Michael Bilerman: It’s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Maybe sticking with theaters more specifically about underwriting the ones you bought in the quarter. I guess, how did you underwrite those from a rent coverage perspective certainly, where they are today and arguably I would assume rent coverages have declined during the year as box office has declined? And then how did you get comfortable, I know you talked a lot about the positives that a lot of theater operators are doing to their assets, but at some point premium video-on-demand is going to come and it’s hard to imagine how that’s not somewhat impactful to the four-walled profitability in the theater even if the exhibitors get hole. So, how do you get comfortable with the potential rent ultimately on renewal is what the exhibitors generating in those four-walls would be less?
John Case: Well, got it. So we have seen on our theaters the rent coverage ratios actually improving and we underwrote these particular theaters that we acquired in the third quarter based on the strong cash flow coverages high-quality of real estate and the fact that they had been renovated. So, they were performing quite well with regard to the premium video-on-demand. There has been discussion in the sector to take it from potentially 90 days which is where it is today down to 45 days for release time. 95% of ticket sales are in the first 40 days after a movies theatrical release. So we don’t think there’ll be a major impact on our theater business from the PVOD discussions that are taking place in addition theaters and studios are negotiating a revenue sharing arrangement with regard to that PVOD business. So that theater should be able to generate some incremental cash flow from that standpoint. So the as you know that the theaters typically have given their higher drop to breakeven higher drop in sales to breakeven they have lower coverage ratios. So something in the low 2s verses in our portfolio average or median which is at 2.8x, because they have more ability to control variable cost. So the coverages once again can be a bit lower.
Michael Bilerman: Right. But the revenue sure that you talked about is will make the exhibiter whole it doesn’t make the four-walled profitability whole of what they are generating in theaters?
John Case: It does contribute to the credit worthiness of the tenant, because it is a source of additional revenues.
Michael Bilerman: Right. But ultimately when they go to resign their lease at that location, the revenues that they can generate in the four walls arguably is less, but like if we are arguing that’s about.
John Case: Yes, I mean that’s not been our experience in what we have seen. We have seen improving operating metrics on our portfolio theaters and we are comfortable with their performance. So, the fact that 95% of the ticket sales are in the first 45 days after release, we just don’t think it’s going to have a material impact on our portfolio of theaters.
Operator: We will take our next question from Collin Mings with Raymond James.
Collin Mings: Hi, good afternoon.
John Case: Hi, Collin.
Collin Mings: First question from me just as far as the disposition guidance here implies a relatively active quarter here in the fourth quarter. Can you maybe just discuss what’s driving that any sort of revisions as far as from a guidance standpoint or things in the pipeline on the asset sale front?
John Case: Sure. So, we have our dispositions guidance from the $125 million to $175 million for the quarter and that’s notably above where we were earlier in the year and these are assets that we are selling that are non-strategic typically. We are taking the proceeds and redeploying them into investments that better fit our investment parameters. What’s driving the increase this year or a couple of office sales that we expect to occur before year end as you know office is not a core product for us. We have acquired some office over the years in larger portfolio transactions and we look to reduce our office exposure. It is non-strategic and it has come down a bit, but we expect it to come down more with these office sales. So, again primarily a couple of office buildings that we plan to sell by year end are driving the upward adjustment and the disposition guidance.
Collin Mings: Okay, that’s helpful. Maybe just sticking with that idea of some asset sales just recognizing there is obviously some unique characteristics about your industrial bucket, but can you maybe just update us on the opportunities there may potentially recycle some capital there, particularly just given the current environment and potentially some better yielding opportunities on the retail front?
John Case: Yes. We like the industrial business. It’s primarily distribution close to 70% of it is related to e-commerce activities on what’s happened it’s a business we would like to grow. What’s happened is that that it’s become incredibly competitive and pricey. So, we haven’t aggressively grown that business this year given just the lofty pricing. We kind of stepped back from being more aggressive on that front. It’s not a business we want to sell and liquidate long-term. We like the prospects and we like the investments that we are in. So, we will continue to look and review at acquisition opportunities in that sector and we hope to find some where the risk-adjusted reward, risk-adjusted returns are a bit more favorable than what we have seen in this frothy industrial market here over the last 6 to 9 months.
Operator: Our next question will go to Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra: Thanks. So, just a couple of quick specific questions, just on Gander Mountain, can you update us how many stores do you have vacant currently and plans to maybe re-lease them or sell them?
John Case: Sure. On Gander, first of all, Gander represented less than 0.5% of our overall rents. So, it was not a very material issue for us. That being said, we had 9 locations, of which Camping World was interested in the vast majority of those locations. However, they were seeking rent reductions that didn’t make sense for us given the quality of the real estate. So, 8 of the 9 locations we are marketing to national retailers at what we believe will be more favorable rates from quite strong tenants than what was being offered by Camping World. So, it’s a conscious decision for us to take these assets and go to market with them and we think we will have a better outcome in terms of recovering our pre-bankruptcy rent. Historically, the company has recovered 82% of the pre-bankruptcy rent on the bankruptcies we have been involved in. We think we will do that well or better with regard to the Gander portfolio.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. And then just on the same-store rental revenue growth, you highlighted the industry’s healthcare or health and fitness childcare C-store that drove the majority of the increase, can you maybe talk about sort of at the other end the offsets which sectors did you see maybe weaker growth?
John Case: Yes. Well in this quarter in this quarter, we had the shoe industry which we have a very minor position in, but that contributed to put negative pressure on the same-store rent growth. Going forward, I think it will continue to move around a bit, but we do feel good about health and fitness and C-stores continuing to help drive positive same-store rent growth.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay, thank you.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors.
Michael Knott: Hey, guys. Quick question for you, John, on pharmacy, I know you guys have a positive view of the space and the numbers look pretty good. Just a question if Amazon does get into the business in a material way, I think literally while we are on the call, there was an article that came out saying they got licenses approved for 12 states or something like that, so, just curious your long-term thoughts on the states if Amazon does try to crack the code on this particular business?
John Case: Yes. Of course it’s something we have been considering and discussing and analyzing for quite sometime now. First of all, we are invested in the three most significant players in the pharmacy market with Walgreens, CVS and then Rite-Aid. We have high quality real estate. We have got companies that are affiliated with pharmacy benefit managers, which drive high market shares. So, there are barriers to entry here. They have well-developed retail and distribution that helps give them a competitive advantage and creates barriers to entry. One thing we have looked at it since 2010 we have looked at how mail order pharmacies have performed relative to brick-and-mortar pharmacies. And since 2010, the prescriptions dispensed through mail order pharmacies have declined by 20% and most of that has been picked up by the Walgreens and CVS’ of the world. In addition, the regulation in the drugstore industry will make it difficult we believe for Amazon to penetrate easily this sector. So, if you look at – if you look at the customers or pharmacies you will see that many of them are on short-term – shorter term prescriptions and of the baby boom generation maybe the older generation and they like to have the face-to-face consultation with the pharmacist. So, often, they prefer picking their prescriptions up in person and having a discussion with the expert on side effects or other issues related to their drugs. So, that’s something that I think bodes well for the brick-and-mortar business. And Walgreens as all of this is played out and you are probably aware of this, Walgreens’ U.S. pharmacy same-store sales growth has been positive for the last 18 consecutive quarters. So they are doing quite well.
Michael Knott: Right. Thanks for that. And then my other question will just be – just on the watch list, I know you said it was basically unchanged from where it’s been in the past, but I guess more of a cycle question than a realty income specific portfolio type question, but just curious if you feel the need to position yourself a little bit more defensively to set the margin from a credit standpoint at this point in the cycle or weather sort of seems like continued sunshiny days out there?
John Case: Yes. Well, we continue to experience levels on the watch list in the low 1% area. The portfolio is performing well. I think that’s evidenced by re-leasing spreads by our continued high occupancy. Our portfolio has performed well with regard to the impact of e-commerce. Our properties have – on the retail side over 90% having service nondiscretionary and/or low price point component. Of the 22 retail bankruptcies this year, 19 have not had any of those characteristics. So, our type of real estate so far has proven to be pretty resilient to what is recognized as the most significant potential disruptor and that is e-commerce. So, we do not – portfolio is performing well and we really don’t need to shift into a more defensive posture right now.
Operator: We will go now to Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.
Joshua Dennerlein: Hi thank you. I thought Walgreen plans to close about 600 drugstores with the acquisition of 2000 stores from Rite Aid. Do you know if any of those stores are in your portfolio or how we should think about that?
John Case: Yes. So, we don’t – we have been in dialogue with Walgreens, but of the 1900 they will be purchasing 1900 Rite Aids and that should close in the spring of 2018. We have 15 Rite Aid stores within a 2-mile radius of a Walgreen store and what Walgreens has indicated is the majority of their store closings are going to be former Rite Aids. Our Rite Aids that are within that 2-mile radius of Walgreens have an average lease term remaining of 9 years and Walgreens even if they close those stores will be responsible for lease payments for 9 more years on those stores. So, I don’t think it will have a material impact on us and based on our preliminary discussions we are not hearing that it will.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay, thank you. And my other question, the wildfires impact – the wildfires in California did they impact the treasury line of states liner in your portfolio at all?
John Case: They did not. There is no material impact, tragic event. Our hearts go out to the people who were affected out there and we wish them the very best in the recovery efforts. And I would also say that about Irma, Harvey and Maria as well, but on the real estate front, we did not have any material impact to our portfolio from any of those unfortunate events.
Operator: Our next question will go to Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann.
Dan Donlan: Thank you and good afternoon. Just wanted to go back to Gander and unit your decision to try to release those procedures seldom take in our printer negotiations with Gander I mean it is very high confidence level in this 80% and just kind of curious how you think about CapEx in regard to these boxes timeframe you know your setting for yourselves on that?
John Case: Yes we have a high degree of confidence in our asset management team did a thorough analysis of what was being proposed by Gander versus what we were hearing talking to other national leading retail tenants so we think that come out better that’s why we made the decision we think our retention rate in terms of rent is going to be as I said equal or higher than our historical rate of 82% now this will play out over a couple quarters a couple these properties are much closer to being inked up than others but we have five that we think are going to happen pretty quickly and the remainder I will take a little bit more time but even when you factor in the time value aspect of that analysis you were better off you went camping world was proposing so it’s the right economic decision for the company and for the shareholders.
Dan Donlan: Okay, understood in an image, keeping with that, I just went back and looked at your vacant asset sales of last 24 months and it seems that you are averaging about 1% of the portfolio in terms of lease on a trailing 12 basis he sold 50 of the last 2012 and then prior 12 months that you sold about 56 so I am just curious how do you see that trending over time is there certain portion of the portfolio that for whatever reason these assets are vacant your deciding to sell is that portion the portfolio would be opposite moving down I am just kind of curious and why the how those things going to trend in the future if there’s something specific to maybe the last two years or for something specific to Mason the legacy assets that you required before 2000 whatever it may have been?
John Case: Yes, I mean I think we’ll continue to see this trend 4, 5 years ago we started more actively managing the portfolio to optimize its overall performance. So what we get you don’t want to do is keep on the books nonstrategic assets that are potentially creating a drag for the company are creating a drag when we can take that capital and reinvested into properties that are higher quality and meet our investment parameters that being said on these vacant asset sales we’re generating unlevered IRRs of roughly 10% or so. So these have been profitable investment is just that there they become a bit obsolete in some cases or maybe the real estate markets surrounding these assets have changed maybe that that the most logical uses for the market don’t make sense anymore. So I would expect us to continue to sell that what I would say vacant the other vacant assets that are and no longer strategic to our investment philosophy.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from [indiscernible].
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I think, I heard you say this but what would the AMCs that you purchased are they fully amenitize of food and alcohol and then when you compare those to the rest of the existing portfolio and I guess it was the AMC portfolio how to they run some coverages compare and how much of the existing portfolio is fully amenetized?
John Case: So the portfolio we purchased yes it was fully amenitize had strong rent coverages. The vast majority of our AMCs had been retrofitted and are there new version and therefore have experience that uptick and overall revenues per theater. So these we believe, we see plenty of theaters and these are of the of the highest quality there in the top quartile of performance for all of AMCs portfolio.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. That’s helpful. And then appreciate some of the color on cap rates you guys have given, but can you just comment on kind of specifically cap rate movement for suburban and rural big-box locations maybe over the past 18 months and investment grade or non-investment grade?
John Case: Sumit, you want to take that.
Sumit Roy: Sure. So most of our investments with regards to big-box falls into what John described as our retail strategy and a very small few approximately 50 off all of the big boxes that don’t fall into a service low price point nondiscretionary element of retail they are with tenants such as Home Depot, Lowe’s et cetera, tenants that we are very, very comfortable with. And what we found in discussions with our tenants that these are assets that are continue to perform well even post our acquisitions, so we have very comfortable with the portfolio that we currently have with regards to big-box.
Operator: We’ll take our next question from Neil Malkin with RBC Capital Markets.
Neil Malkin: Hi, guys good afternoon. Sorry if I missed but the spreads or the cap rates acquisitions were a good bit higher than they’ve been the last several quarters the function of mix in the asset you purchased or and what kind of to that phenomenon?
John Case: Yes, the spreads were in the third quarter about 260 basis points, which is at the high-end of our range year-to-date we’re running that about 05 to 10, so it was primarily a result of having higher yields. In the third quarter on the acquisitions and we had a favorable [indiscernible] cost of while cost of capital during the quarter as well, so it’s a combination – it’s a combination of the 2. So the theater transaction, which represented a large component of what we did in the third quarter you had a higher cap rate which help drive the overall higher cap rate for the third quarter.
Neil Malkin: Got it. And then this was all the things are kind of going on with drug stores are you seeing or is it too soon seller expectation change or are you may be changing the way you kind of look at risk to you incremental drug store acquisitions just given the sort of the new things that are coming authentic competition e-commerce, or changing demographics what have you?
John Case: We are comfortable with our drugstore exposure we are at 10.8% of rental revenues for drug stores so we as we say we don’t want any single industry being much more than the low single double digits in terms of what it represents as a percent of our overall rental revenue and then Walgreens our largest drugstore tenant is 6.6% of rental revenues and we are comfortable with that exposure that being said we are not looking to yet we want to remain diversified that created a lot of stability and cunning de-risk our portfolio for the company so we are not looking to materially add to your overall drugstore exposure nor the Walgreens exposure we are comfortable with where we are.
Operator: We take our next question from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: Hi, thanks. Most recent balancing questions. So, I guess for Paul you have got a bond in a term loan maturing in January you have historically issued bonds when the longer-term side but do a whole in your debt maturity schedule in 2020 because the coupons in the debt maturities are fairly low in 2% range would you consider going little shorter term and revise?
Paul Meurer: While in general our philosophy remains the same which is generally speaking longer-term unsecured bonds as part of a liability structure but ultimately we look at our debt maturity schedule over time and when there’s holes there we do take advantage of those we think a laddered maturities schedule is prudent relative to how we lay out our maturities and point out there’s a couple gaps out there one of which is obviously 2025 which would speak to the potential for seven-year bonds and then certainly everything is available kind of thereafter overall we look at the maturity schedule and think about what in each of those buckets how much and as such you know you could see us do anything you know from 5 years to 7 years to 10 years to 12 to 20 to 30 were constantly looking at what all the alternatives are and always want to keep our options open as it relates to that you will see us lean towards the unsecured market you know and dealing with institutional bond investors and we got a lot of interest from bond investors at a really all maturities across the curve.
Todd Stender: That’s helpful. And then with the equity raise in Q3 to help with your year lobbying for a higher credit rating and they range in one of the rating agencies holding out for at this point?
Paul Meurer: Well the rating agencies are conducting their own analysis and they are not previewing any of that with us we think we posted it another strong quarter here operationally is currently the balance sheet is in excellent shape so you will see what they come back with.
Operator: We’ll go next to Nick Yulico with UBS.
Nick Yulico: Well thanks for the Rite Aid stores that you do own I mean at this point of those 69 properties have any of those are the ones that are being sold to Walgreens?
John Case: We don’t know precisely in our preliminary discussions it looks like the range could be anywhere from about 10 to 30 stores but that’s preliminary and that could change one thing we like is that Rite Aid is going to use the proceeds from the sale nearly $5 billion including the termination fee from the original merger to improve its balance sheet Rite Aid is going to take its debt EBITDA from 7.5x down approximately 4.5x and they are also going to have access to Walgreens purchasing network and Rite Aid it will be more focused on the West Coast as they saw more of what they sell to Walgreens that’s going to be along the Eastern Seaboard which will allow Walgreens to fully develop its footprint there. So I think it’s a win-win, Walgreens comes out with significant synergies they’re expecting have maybe up to 400 million in synergies from this transaction in the first 3 to 4 years and they have a bigger footprint and they’re more efficient company and then Rite Aid is still the third largest player more focused out west with a much better balance sheet. So we’re pleased with the outcome of this asset sale even though they couldn’t get the full merger approved by the FTC.
Nick Yulico: Okay. And I know it doesn’t show up as a top 10 of yours, but you have exposure to Fred’s?
John Case: Yes, we don’t talk about, we don’t talk about tenants outside our top 20 but Fred’s is now, we don’t have…
Nick Yulico: Okay. So you don’t have any exposure to Fred?
John Case: No, no.
Nick Yulico: Okay. We trying to get a sense for what give your blended coverage on retail, but what is the coverage like for your pharmacy exposure is it meaningfully different is it lower than are you reported here for overall retail?
John Case: It’s right at the average or the median.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income’s conference call. I would now like to turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.
John Case: Thanks, Don and we appreciate everyone for joining us today. And we look forward to seeing everyone at NAREIT in a few weeks. Take care. Have a good afternoon.
Operator: This does conclude today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-08-03 14:30:00) =====
Executives: Bonni Rosen - Director, Investor Relations Glenn Rufrano - Chief Executive Officer Michael Bartolotta - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: Joshua Dennerlein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Sheila McGrath - Evercore ISI Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors Mitchell Germain - JMP Securities Christopher Lucas - Capital One Securities
Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the VEREIT Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bonni Rosen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Bonni Rosen: Thank you. Thank you for joining us today for the VEREIT 2017 second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Rufrano, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Bartolotta, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being webcast on our website at vereit.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at approximately 3:00 PM Eastern Time today. Dial-in for the replay is 1-877-344-7529 with the confirmation code of 10109813. Before I turn the call over to Glenn, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements in this earnings call, which are not historical facts, will be forward-looking. VEREIT's actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC filings, including the quarterly report filed today. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports, VEREIT disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by law. Let me quickly review the format of today's call. First, Glenn will begin by providing a business and operational update, followed by Mike presenting our quarterly financial results. Glenn will then wrap up with closing remarks. We will conclude today's call by opening the line for questions. Glenn?
Glenn Rufrano: Thanks, Bonni, and thanks for joining our call. Results are as expected. For the quarter, AFFO per diluted share is $0.18. To-date, acquisitions totaled $273.3 million and we've completed $433.6 million of dispositions. In line with guidance, disposition is frontend loaded and acquisition is backend. Net debt to EBITDA decreased to 5.4 times, before the guidance range of 5.7 to 6, providing capital flexibility. And we are narrowing our AFFO guidance from $0.70-to-$0.73 to $0.71-to-$0.73 per share. Starting with operations, occupancy was 98.6%, up slightly from 98.4%. Same-store rent was flat for the quarter. Excluding the effects of our early lease renewals efforts, same-store would have increased 0.3%. During the quarter, we had 720,000 square feet of lease renewals, of which 523,000 square feet were executed early. Notable early lease transactions included Wells Fargo and Rockwell Collins office properties, as well as the renewal for an industrial facility to lease to Iron Mountain. For the year, we have renewed 368,000 square feet of leases with a 100% recovery. We've also completed more than 660,000 square feet of early lease renewals with a 91% recovery. These leases have built in increases in an average wealth of 12 years. Turning to capital activity, during the quarter, we completed a restaurant exchange with Golden Gate Capital. In the transaction, VEREIT received 22 Bob Evans Restaurants by that 50 million, in exchange for 15 Red Lobster properties with the same value. This NOI exchange contributed to a reduction in our Red Lobster exposure to 7%, down from 7.4% and further diversified our restaurant portfolio on a non-dilutive basis. Second quarter acquisitions were $101.6 million and $70.2 million subsequent to the quarter. These 41 transactions included retail properties in multiple categories such as fitness, automotive service, hobby, and home and garden, as well two industrial properties representing 35% of the transactions. For the year, acquisitions totaled $273.3 million. Second quarter dispositions were $224.8 million with $9.6 million subsequent to the quarter. These 44 transactions were spread across our strategic categories, and included Red Lobster office, non-core properties, restaurants and flat leases. Of note, we sold a large energy-related office building in Texas for $387 a foot. Dispositions for the year now totaled $433.6 million, near the low end of our $450 million to $600 million guidance range. Capital allocation has strengthened the balance sheet with net debt to EBITDA of 5.4 times, providing ample room for leverage-neutral acquisitions. 99% of our debt is fixed, lessening any near-term impact of potential interest rate increases. During the quarter, Cole Capital raised $78 million of new equity, an average of $26 million a month, and an increase of 17% over the first quarter, while the industry was down 37%. Additionally, 23 new selling agreements were signed in Q2, representing more than 15,000 financial advisors. New equity for July was $22.3 million. Before Mike reviews our financial results, let me provide a brief update on litigation. The Court heard oral argument on the plaintiff's motion for class certification and scheduled a hearing on August 24 for each side's expert to testify regarding the class certification issues. Document discovery has also been substantially completed. Additional details regarding pending litigations can be found in our 10-Q filed today. Let me now turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Bartolotta: Thanks, Glenn, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a good quarter, achieving AFFO of $0.18 per diluted share. Consolidated revenue was $336.9 million, below last quarter's revenue of $348 million, primarily due to net dispositions during the year, along with lower operating expense reimbursements in certain adjustments to CAM. Net income for the second quarter was $34.2 million versus net income of $14.8 million last quarter. The increase was mostly the result of a higher gain on properties sold in this quarter, along with a gain on extinguishment of debt this quarter, partially offset by lower real estate revenue and a higher impairment charge. FFO per diluted share for the second quarter was $0.17, consistent with the first quarter also at $0.17. Q2 had lower real estate revenue, along with higher litigation costs, partially offset by a gain on the extinguishment of debt and a decrease in the income tax provision, resulting in a flat quarter-over-quarter change. AFFO was $0.18 per diluted share versus $0.19 last quarter, mainly due to lower real estate revenue and the increase in current income and franchise taxes, offset by lower property operating, G&A and interest expenses, along with an increase in Cole Capital revenue. G&A for the quarter was $29.4 million versus $29.1 million for the first quarter, representing an increase of $0.3 million. Real estate G&A was $14.3 million for the quarter, up $1.7 million from $12.7 million in the prior quarter. This was mostly due to the equity-based compensations for directors that is granted and vest in Q2, and certain annual filing fees incurred in Q2. Cole Capital G&A was $15.1 million in the second quarter, down $1.5 million from $16.6 million in Q1. This decrease was mainly due to slightly lower compensation and benefits, professional fees and office expenses during the quarter. Legal expenses related to the matters arising from the Audit Committee investigation, which are included in litigation and other non-routine costs were approximately $14.4 million for the quarter, bringing the year-to-date amount to $27 million. Turning to our second quarter real estate activity, the company purchased 38 properties for $101.6 million at an average cash cap rate of 7%. Subsequent to the quarter of the company purchased three properties for $70.2 million and an average cash cap rate of 6.5%. During the quarter, we disposed of 37 properties for $224.8 million at an average cash cap rate of 6.9% and a gain of $43.1 million, subsequent to the quarter the company disposed of seven properties for an aggregate sales price of $9.6 million at an average cash cap rate of 7.2%. Our balance sheet remains very safe and liquid, we continue to have full capacity under our credit facility of $2.3 billion. At June 30, we also had $292.5 million in cash and essentially no floating rate debt. During the quarter, we've reduced secured debt by $203.8 million with only $162.5 million coming due during the remainder of the year. Any secured debt coming due is expected to eventually be termed out with unsecured debt. As of June 30, our net debt to normalized EBITDA was reduced to 5.4 times from 5.5 times. Our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 3 times, and our net debt to gross real estate investments ratio was 38%. Our unencumbered asset ratio was 70% and the weighted average duration of our debt stands at 4 years. And with that, I'll turn it back to Glenn.
Glenn Rufrano: Thanks, Mike. REITs business model incorporate the large diversified portfolio providing the ability to whether cyclical and secular change. We maintain a proven infrastructure and the expertise to effectively manage our portfolio. Our focus in on four property types, single-tenant retail, restaurant, office and industrial, which spreads volatility and provide optionality to take advance of market dislocations over time. Presenting the characteristics of our property types, we can illustrate our risk is mitigated. Single-tenant retail is differentiated from other general retail format, we have a large percentage of credit tenants 47% of investment grade and 66% of our tenants are public companies. Generally, we do not have co-tenancy or occupancy requirements. We are able to target individual tenants and merchandise categories, and our portfolio was dominated by off price and necessity shopping with only 0.2% of income from apparel and jewelry, far less than other retail formats. Our diversified restaurant portfolio is primarily comprised a strong national dinning concepts, according to Nation's Restaurant News, which publishes the top industry brand based upon system like sales. 86% of our casual dining tenants and 78% of our cook service restaurants are ranked in the top 25 of their respective category, beyond Red Lobster, we have low concentration by tenant concepts. Combined 92% of our retail tenant based is service, retail merchandise categories with lower online disruption and restaurants. The average size of our office assets are 148,000 square feet with 59% of our tenants investment grade. These properties are strategic to their companies business with 33% corporate headquarters and 67% corporate operations. Facilities are spread across top MSAs such as Chicago, Dallas, Boston and Washington, D.C. Our industrial assets are in close proximity to ports, railways and major freeways with three quarters located in the top 50 markets, as logistics and delivery become increasingly important. Our properties are essential to the tenants operations with 87% dedicated to distribution and warehousing. 57% of our industrial tenants are investment grade. Our ability to implement our plan during the past two years has enabled us to strengthen our business model and reshape the portfolio. We have sold over $3 billion of assets including approximately $890 million of office, $870 million of Red Lobster restaurants, $710 million in flat leases, $360 million of non-core and $125 million of retail joint ventures, in all realizing a gain of $200 million. We've decreased top 10 tenant portfolio concentration from 33.3% to 29.4% and reduced net debt-to-EBITDA from 7.6 times to 5.4 times today. We are now poised to provide capital to corporate clients through a targeted acquisition process. With that, I'll now open the line to questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Joshua Dennerlein: Hey, good afternoon, guys.
Glenn Rufrano: Yes, good afternoon.
Joshua Dennerlein: A question, how should we think about acquisitions and dispositions for the second half of the year? Do you expect to kind of stay near the lower end of your range for dispositions or do you think you'll keep chugging through? And do you expect to be a net acquirer?
Glenn Rufrano: Well, we are at $433 million of dispositions. We're pretty close to the low end. I would expect we'll be somewhere between the $450 million and $600 million. And if we find the right pricing on the assets for sale, we could be closer to $600 million. On the acquisitions, as we mentioned in our guidance, it would be tail end loaded. We're $273 million to-date. We do expect to get and we will get into the guidance of $450 million to $600 million. And if we can find the right acquisitions, we would expect to be in the higher end of that range.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. And moving on, have you started your evaluation of whether or not Cole is better inside VEREIT or potentially sold off to a third party?
Glenn Rufrano: Well, our goal has continued to be to reestablish and increase the value of Cole. We believe we've done a really good job of that. And we continue to do that. The critical issues this year have been bringing Cetera and Advisor Group on, two very large companies, who are now just beginning to sell. For instance, Cetera has now started marketing INAV, and over the last few months have increased their sales nicely. They are just going to start as we speak V and III. They've been approved. And so, we're hoping to see some benefit of that in the tail end of the year. Advisor Group has approved V and has been increasing sales of V over the last few months. They will now being their due diligence on INAV and then III. So we are expecting to have some real nice push there. As we look at reestablishing net value, we'll then think about what we do about Cole, whether it's internal or external. Our goal is to increase value. We'll then decide whether the market is valuing it properly.
Joshua Dennerlein: Got it, and one last one for me, the Red Lobster and Bob Evans exchange, can you discuss how that came about and if there is opportunity to do more?
Glenn Rufrano: Well, the Golden Gate Capital as you know owns Red Lobsters, is a terrific partner that's done a great job on Red Lobster. They purchased Bob Evans. And we saw an opportunity for us to sell Red Lobster, which is a goal. Even though the properties are doing well, we just want to take that concentration down. And at the same time, diversify our casual dining portfolio with Bob Evans, which is a brand we like certainly in the hands of Golden Gate. Not only we like them, they are 5,600 square feet. We've got good corners. And so, we thought it would be a good way to have an acquisition and disposition at the same time. It was an NOI exchange. And that allowed us to diversify on a purely non-dilutive basis. The valuation cap rate for Red Lobster, for each of the portfolio was 7.25. And remember, as we sell Red Lobster, as we have been selling Red Lobsters. The net to us is about 7 on an individual property. $50 million, 7.25 seems fair. And we thought it's a very fair price for Bob Evans. As a matter of fact, in terms of comps, we think that was very fair. So Golden Gate helped us. And we'd love to find opportunities like that. They're rare though.
Joshua Dennerlein: Got it. Thank you [indiscernible].
Operator: The next question comes from Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Sheila McGrath: Yes, good afternoon. Glenn, I was wondering if you could touch on the tenant watch-list, any notable change from last quarter and your insights just on retail, grocery store and movie theatre exposure.
Glenn Rufrano: Sure, I'll start out with the credit watch-list. Last quarter, we were just slightly over 2%. We're the same, Sheila. We really haven't changed very much. If you think about the quarter, there hasn't been as much noise in the second quarter as in the first. There's been some with a few mall tenants like True Religion and Michael Kors. And there's also been some discussion on movie theatres. We have none. So I could answer that right away for you.
Sheila McGrath: Thank you.
Glenn Rufrano: And so we have found the quarter that didn't change much at all in our credit watch. I think your second part of that was retail and general.
Sheila McGrath: Well, retail and also just your thoughts on grocery stores.
Glenn Rufrano: Got you. On grocers, our grocers are 4.5% our income right now. Of that, Albertsons is just about 2% - got 2.1% and then the rest are spread out amongst many others. No other grocer more than 0.7%. And so, they're pretty diversified group of grocers. We feel pretty good about it. They're traditional and compete well. The sales are good for the grocers we get sales for. Our total occupancy cost is 2.7%. And so we're well within the range of them being able to pay us. And so we're happy with the grocer concentration we have right now.
Sheila McGrath: Okay, great. And one follow-up, on the legal settlement process, if you can just give us your insight, if the guilty verdict on the prior CFO, does that have any impact on this legal process. And then if you can just give us some insight, I know you can early comment on magnitude and stuff, but just key assign on kind of the steps in terms of timing, you mentioned in August Day, and that was in the Q, so just some clarity that you can frame for us on that?
Glenn Rufrano: On the court case, Sheila, what I can say is that the civil lawsuits will continue to proceed on the contract, there are no change in that. In terms of the timing, class certification was the concept that I just talked about in that. What will be reviewed on the August Meeting.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. And so will there be news in August that you would - that we would hear or that just like a formality?
Glenn Rufrano: There could be news, because the court could rule on the class certification in it, so we would announce whatever that ruling is, it's not just a formality, it's a formal process.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. Thank you.
Glenn Rufrano: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Michael Knott: Hey, guys. Glenn, just curious how are you thinking about the Red Lobster concentration, if you still expect to get that down to 6% by the end of the year. And then what the timing would be to hit the ultimate goal on that?
Glenn Rufrano: Yeah, we're at 7 now which is pretty good. I think, there is a shot to get close to 6%. We clearly, we are marketing them, Michael, we are continuing to do that. But we are making sure, we are marketing them prudently, we have gained continually there, as you can see that's a good part of the $200 million in gains we've had. We bought them at 7.8 and we're selling them at less. And we expect to continue that. So I'd say there is a good chance, we'll get very close to 6%. And then, we will look into next year to move it down to the 5% range.
Michael Knott: And then just in general, if it does turnout that you are sort of pivoting in the back half more towards being a net buyer, just curious I think about sort of extrapolating the trend into 2018, if you were in our shoes, how would you think about, how much of pivoting that might be, how are you thinking about your cost of capital today?
Glenn Rufrano: I think, part of your question is net buyer. We would expect in 2018 to have less disposition activity, because our portfolio as we've illustrated getting pretty close to where we would like to be from a diversification standpoint. So if we do - we have left disposition next year. If we find acquisition activity that will help us be a net acquirer next year. So that's an expectation. In terms of cost of capital today, everything is self-financed. We talked about our net debt to EBITDA of 5.4 times, well below the target of 5.7 to 6. So we have debt capacity, and we have other disposition activity to finance those certainly to this year.
Michael Knott: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Mitch Germain with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Mitchell Germain: Good afternoon. So Glenn, I want to ask Mike's question in a different way. I know you have some contracts or obviously, some agreement in place to sell some Red Lobster next year, I think it's around 250 is all of that still a play here or is it now just really your ability or you guys are wanting to sell Red Lobster at your schedule?
Glenn Rufrano: It's really in our schedule. We have pretty good flexibility here. There are no constraints over the next year and all in terms of selling Red Lobster. So it's up to us, we like it, we love the 20 year leases, the exchange we've made of 20 year leases for Red Lobster's, for roughly 20 year leases of Bob Evans, so that's wonderful. But we'll continue to look at selling them at the right price.
Mitchell Germain: Got you. And I just - one last question for me in terms of guidance. I think, you obviously narrowed the range, but if we kind of think of the cadence for the next two quarters, if dispositions slow, acquisitions pick up, it seems like, if nothing changes from your current levels, you already at the high end of the range, you have the net acquisition you might actually have some offside to that. So just curious about your thoughts in terms of how the playbook looks rest of the year?
Glenn Rufrano: The pickup on the bottom, I'd start there, is a result of being $0.01 over consensus as you can see $0.19 and $0.18, which we believe will stabilize that bottom. In terms of the top end of the range, you point is the exact point. How we have net acquisitions in the last half of the year. We have the capacity, and we certainly have the throughput we have in the first two quarters about $12 billion of deals given to us to take a look at. So the markets there, it's only a question of whether we find the transactions, we like it. We do there is a shot that we can get that at higher end.
Mitchell Germain: Many thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Christopher Lucas: Good afternoon, everyone. Mike, just the question on the insurance recoveries related to litigation hasn't been any at least that I've seen in - reported in the Qs. What's the expectation in terms of the timing on something like that?
Michael Bartolotta: We continue to work with our agents and our lawyers were working on that, but we've never given guidance on that. We collect them - and report them as we collect them.
Christopher Lucas: Okay. And then, Glenn, on the office sales that you've mentioned earlier in the call, I think, it was Dallas, was that a - was it vacant but paying tenant in that building? Or what exactly - could you give us a little more color on that?
Glenn Rufrano: Sure. That was a building in Plano, Texas. A good location, good building, 100% leased to Encana, the energy firm. Encana never occupied the building, but they sublet the building and actually had that building just beyond 90%. And so it's a good building, a little - the structure and the lease, for us with subtenants wasn't optimum. The buyer was some who had some land around that building, and by joining the land in the building, put together a nice property. And we think, we've got a very fair price.
Christopher Lucas: And then, just shifting over to Cole quickly. I guess, I'm just wondering how you think about the pace of both the process for signing up new distribution agreements and then probably more importantly once they're signed, the pace to actually get these different platforms in the position where they have done their diligence and are actually able to sell the product. Is that - has that been occurring at a pace that you were comfortable with? Or it feels slow to me, but I'm just curious at how guys think about it.
Glenn Rufrano: Well, it is slower than you or would like, I'd say, Chris, just listening to you. Because if we just take Cetera and Advisor Group, who terrific companies. They have a very diligent due diligence process. I am surprised actually at the extent, but I admire it. They make sure that not only is the advisor acceptable, but each of the products goes through due diligence. And for instance, as I mentioned, Cetera initially not only diligence stuff, but INAV. Then it took a while for them to go through CCPT V and CCIT III. They just got through that. Advisor Group started out with V and now it's moved on to INAV and it will take some time for them to diligence INAV and then diligence III, it's a process. And whether I think gets too long or too short, doesn't matter. It's a reasonable process and we will work with them and we'll get through it.
Christopher Lucas: Okay. Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Glenn Rufrano: Yeah.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Glenn Rufrano for any closing remarks.
Glenn Rufrano: We thank everybody for being with us this summer day and we look forward to speaking with you between now and the third quarter. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-05-04 14:30:00) =====
Executives: Bonni Rosen - Director of IR Glenn Rufrano - CEO Mike Bartolotta - CFO
Analysts: Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors Sheila McGrath - Evercore Mitch Germain - JMP Securities Chris Lucas - Capital One Securities Joshua Dennerlein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan
Operator: Good morning everyone and welcome to the VEREIT First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] And please note that the event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bonni Rosen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Bonni Rosen: Thank you. Thank you for joining us today for the VEREIT 2017 first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Rufrano, our Chief Executive Officer and Mike Bartolotta, our Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call is being webcast on our website at vereit.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at approximately 3:00 PM Eastern Time today. Dial-in for the replay is 1-877-344-7529, with a confirmation code of 10104472. Before I turn the call over to Glenn, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements in this earnings and business update call, which are not historical facts, will be forward-looking. VEREIT’s actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Annual Report filed today. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports, VEREIT disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by law. Let me quickly review the format of today’s call. First, Glenn will begin by providing a business and operational update, followed by Mike presenting our quarterly financial results. Glenn will then wrap up with closing remarks. We will conclude today’s call by opening the line for questions. Glenn?
Glenn Rufrano: Thanks Bonni, and thanks for all you are joining today. Let me begin with a summary of a few items. For the quarter, AFFO per diluted share was $0.19. Acquisitions to date totaled 116.1 million. We completed approximately 213.9 million of dispositions. Net debt to EBITDA decreased to 5.5 times. Both Moody's and S&P recently upgraded the company to investment grade and we are reaffirming guidance provided in our last call of $0.70 to $0.73 of AFFO.  Starting with operations, occupancy was 98.4%, up slightly from 98.3%. Same store rent was down 0.3% for the quarter excluding the effects of the Ovation bankruptcy in last year's early renewal efforts, same store rents would have increased 0.3%. During the quarter, we entered into 61,000 square feet of new leases and 308,000 square feet of renewals of which 138,000 square feet were executed earlier. Notable lease transactions included 32,000 square foot office to franchise food, six bank locations and 125,000 square feet of restaurants space. Since introducing our business plan portfolio diversification has been enhanced by culling, going forward acquisitions will contribute. Year to date acquisitions are 116.1 million including 14.6 million subsequent to the quarter. The 21 transactions included retail properties in multiple categories; grosser, convenience, automotive service, and fitness; three leased fee interests and the distribution facility.  As mentioned last quarter, the industrial asset is leased to Best Buy, also our retail tenant. We find the cross property relationship for 20 of our tenants representing approximately 20% of our revenue. Year-to-date we have sold 55 assets spread across our strategic categories totaling 213.9 million including 14.7 million subsequent to the quarter. Dispositions included Red Lobster restaurants reducing exposure to the end of Q1 to 7.4% from 8.2% as well as office non-core properties and flat leases. Turning to the balance sheet, net debt to EBITDA was 5.5 times providing ample room for leverage neutral acquisitions. Also 99% of our debt is fixed, less than any near term impact from potential interest rate increases. The progress we've made during the past two years resulted in Moody’s upgrading VEREIT to Baa3, while S&P brought the company to BBB- matching the prior rating in our debt.  The company is now investment grade with all three major agencies including Fitch. During the quarter Cole Capital raised 66.7 million of new equity, an average of 22.2 million a month with a 25% monthly increase in March compared to February. Additionally, 18 new selling agreements were signed in Q1 representing more than 4,500 financial advisors. In April, Advisory Group one of Cole’s historically large broker dealer partners approved CCPT5 and initiated sales efforts. So Tara began INEP earlier this year and launched the CCPT5 last month. New equity for April was 24.7 million. Before Mike reviews our financial results let we provide a brief update on litigation. The plaintiffs in the class action have filed their motion for a class certification and defendants will file their responses by the end of this week. A conference is scheduled with the court on May 16. Additional details regarding pending litigations can be found in our 10-Q filed today. Let me now turn over the call to Mike.
Mike Bartolotta: Thanks Glenn and thank you all for joining us today. We had a good quarter achieving AFFO of $0.19 per diluted share, consolidated revenue was 348 million just below last quarter's revenue of 351.9 million, mostly due to our disposition program. Before I discuss the rest of our current Q1 2017 results, let me highlight the effects of certain Q4 activity that otherwise skews our quarterly performance comparisons.  These items were all noted in Q4 and included 120.9 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge and 11.1 million program development right off and 5.2 million of compensated related charges, all partially offset by 5.7 million of the applicable tax effect on these items. Now let's review the main comparative operational changes for the quarter. We reported Q1 2017 net income of 14.8 million versus a net loss of 118.2 million for Q4 2016. Without the items noted previously you would have seen a Q1 2017 increase in net income of 1.5 million. The slight increase was mostly the result of lower depreciation and amortization primarily driven by the property dispositions and increase in the net gain on properties sold, all partially offset by slightly lower revenue, higher net litigation costs and tax expenses.  FFO per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.17 as compared to $0.05 for the fourth quarter. However, the FFO for Q4 2016 excluding charges noted earlier would have been $0.19 per share or Q1 2017 decrease of $0.02 per share. This was mainly due to the lower revenue previously mentioned along with increased net litigation costs which were really driven by $10 million insurance proceeds received in Q4 and the net negative quarter to quarter tax provision. AFFO was $0.19 per diluted share as compared to $0.17 for the fourth quarter, however again excluding the impact of the Q4 2016 charges, Q4 AFFO would have been $0.19 per share or flat when compared to Q1. G&A for the quarter was 29.1 million versus 44.4 million for the fourth quarter representing a decrease of 15.2 million. However, G&A for Q4 2016 without the items noted would have been 28.1 million or Q1 2017 increase of 1 million.  Real estate G&A was 12.6 million for the quarter, down 0.7 million from 13.3 million in the prior quarter, mostly due to the normal year-end activity in the fourth quarter. Cole Capital G&A was 16.6 million in Q1, up 1.8 million from 14.8 million in Q4 excluding the charges previously noted. This was due primarily to an increase in program development costs which represented resulting from a decrease in the expected future recovery rate effective Q1 2017. Legal costs related to the matters arising from the Audit Committee investigation which are included in litigation and other non-routine costs were approximately 12.7 million for this quarter. Turning to the first quarter real estate activity, the company purchased 16 properties for 81.8 million at an average cash cap rate of 7.1%. In addition, we purchased the fee interest in three properties for 24 million which were already on the lease holds at an average cash cap rate of 5.5%.  We were able to extend the leases on two of these properties and increased NAV. Subsequent to the quarter, the company purchased two properties for 14.6 million at an average cash cap rate of 6.7%. During the quarter we sold 50 properties for 199.2 million at an average cash cap rate of 7.3% and a gain of 12.5 million. Subsequent to the quarter, the company disposed of five properties for an aggregate sales price of 14.7 million at an average cash cap rate of 7.1%. Our balance sheet remains very safe and liquid, we continue to have full capacity under our credit facility of 2.3 billion at 286 million in cash and essentially no floating debt. During the quarter we had net repayments of 81.7 million of secured debt with only 301 million coming due the remainder of the year. And any secured debt coming due is expected to eventually be termed out with unsecured debt.  Cash flow provides ample coverage for our dividends. As Glenn mentioned we have now achieved investment grade on all three - from all three rating agencies, which is a true testament to what the team has accomplished. As of 3/31, our net debt to normalized EBITDA was reduced to 5.5 times from 7.5 times. Our fixed charge coverage ratio remains healthy at 2.9 times and our net debt to gross asset ratios has been reduced to 39%. Our incumbent asset ratio was 67% and the weighted average duration of our debt stands at 4.2 years. And with that I'll turn the call back to Glenn.
Glenn Rufrano: Thanks Mike. In late May, many of us will head to ICSC RECon the largest real estate conference in the world. As an ICSC trustee I have the opportunity to spend time with other retail landlords, developers and advisors as well as executive of many tenants. RECon is an excellent opportunity to meet face to face with our retailers, learn more about their operations and discuss how we can leverage our partnership.  During the two and a half day conference, we’ll host nearly 90 face to face meetings with tenants like Home Depot, TJX, Michaels, PetSmart, LA Fitness, Dick's Sporting Goods and [indiscernible] amongst others and including restaurant. Following RECon our real estate teams will travel to many of our tenants corporate headquarters for strategic alliance reviews to discuss existing lease structures and renewals as well as acquisition opportunities for their long-term housing needs. Although I’m sure our discussions at RECon will revolve around the ever changing retail environment, all industries are prone to cyclical and secular disruptives. Cyclical change can be a product of overbuilding the rise and fall of brands or macroeconomic issues such as consumer confidence or changing interest rates. Secular changes are long lasting and there are a number of these changes taking place as we speak; ecommerce and omni-channel relationships, plus office space per square foot per person, increased industrial ceiling height, just to name a few.  Real estate investors approach these conditions in a number of ways. If you are not in an opportunistic fund, you may attempt to market time and try to arbitrage the profit from the resulting changes. However REITs are long-term vehicles that must adopt the strategy to help minimize the negative impact of such trends. For VEREIT, our long-term strategy of well positioned properties in a diversified portfolio made optimum by our size. Helps protect us from a variety of changes. Key portfolio metrics include 4,100 properties representing 42 industries and 663 tenant concepts. Properties dispersed across 49 states. The top ten tenets comprising only 29.5% of the portfolio and property type diversification with retail, restaurants, office, and industrial helping mitigate risk. Focusing on our retail mix, we're dominated by off price and necessity shopping of which 50% is investment grade.  In many of our core categories we see reasonable expansion plans in 2017 and beyond. In more detailed analysis of our merchandise categories are deals discount comprised of 7.9%, pharmacy 7.2, grocer 5.1, home and garden 4.5 and convenience 2.5%. Approximately 67% of our retail revenue is derived from tenants that are public companies providing increased transparency into their operations and finances. Our single tenant retail tends to have the following advantages. Credit tenants on long term leases with substantial capital investments. Generally no use restrictions or [indiscernible] issues and the ability to target tenants and industries. As we mentioned last quarter, we have virtually no traditional department stores or material exposure to specialty apparel and within sporting goods and electronics are limited tendency is dominated by strong operators. We're comfortable with our size, diversity and our single tenant focus. I’ll now open the lines to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And it looks like our first questioner today is going to Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead with your question.
Michael Knott: Just curious if you're seeing any weakness perhaps in the restaurant trade or just given the weakness that your peer mentioned yesterday when they reported their earnings?
Glenn Rufrano: Have not Michael, I think what's important in our restaurants is the take a look at who we have and the diversification. We feel very good about Red Lobster as you know and also happy that they were recapitalized with Thai Union recently. But once you go beyond Red Lobster, if you look at the rest, Applebee's is 1.7, Olive Garden 0.6, 0.5, Cracker Barrel 0.5, [indiscernible] about 0.7. So we have a good stable of restaurants and the diversification, it helps that add a lot, so we're very comfortable.
Michael Knott: And then just couple other quick ones for me. Can you talk about how you’re thinking about Cole Capital today and any decisions that you think you might reach on that business line maybe by the end of the year and just how you see it position today from a broad standpoint?
Glenn Rufrano: We were happy to announce that advisory group came on, which was one of our larger broker dealers in the ’13 to ’14 era. And we did announce last quarter at the end of the year that Cetera came on. So the progress we've made with the larger advisors, larger broker dealers has been very helpful for us to establish the brand value of Cole. We're getting there that progress means a lot to us. We will make a decision relative to the value of Cole and how the public market sees it. It may be later on this year, it may be the beginning of next year, but what we care about is establishing and maintaining that value.
Michael Knott: And then last question from me would just be one of your peers recently had a nice credit upgrade from one of their C store tenants they got acquired by 711 and just curious if the reports are true about BJs wholesale perhaps being up for sale, would you put any stock in getting a credit upgrade there since I think that's a B- credit at present.
Glenn Rufrano: BJ is a Northeastern company that has really terrific locations, they're certainly not on par with Costco. If they got upgraded because someone acquired them that would be very nice. We're not going to bet on that. We’re happy with their credit right now and like the position we have there.
Operator: And our next questioner today is going to be Sheila McGrath with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.
Sheila McGrath: Yes. Good afternoon. Glenn, could you give us an insight on your tenant watch list now and how it might compare to year-end? Has there been any meaningful changes to that watchlist?
Glenn Rufrano: Sure, Sheila. At year-and, we’ve discussed a watchlist and we have a series of tenants with probability weighting of about 1.8%. We've had a very slight increase in that this quarter. We thought it was prudent to look at every tenant, which we have and we're now at about 2%. So it is a very slight increase, but I will tell you it was a thorough review that we had here to get there.
Sheila McGrath: Okay. And then on the acquisition side of things, the last two quarters, you have added assets, but you're still selling more than you're acquiring on balance sheet. Just wondering if we look out through the balance of the year, should we assume on the balance sheet that you'll be a net seller of assets?
Glenn Rufrano: Our guidance, which we reaffirmed on this call Sheila has us selling about 450 to 600 in assets and buying about 450 to 600 in assets. We believe those bids for now. We also mentioned when we gave guidance that we would have more dispositions in the beginning of the year and acquisitions at the end of the year and we're conforming to it. And I would also mention that as you would expect, we are very cautious on acquiring anything at any point in time in the economy.  Frankly, I mentioned on the call last time I never gave acquisition guidance before. But we thought it’s appropriate here. We're going to buy appropriate assets. We are very targeted in what we will buy. We're pleased with what we've bought this quarter and if we can continue to finance it that fit the merchandise categories with the tenants we're looking for in retail and we can find the industrial properties that fit our locational requirements we believe we’ll be able to buy that enough assets for guidance and our disposition program has gone well with 200 million in the fourth quarter, 132 million of which were Red Lobsters, we feel we're well on our way to that $450 million to $600 million number.
Operator: And our next questioner today is going to be Mitch Germain with JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Mitch Germain: Good afternoon. Just, Glenn, you talked about the secular disruptors I think. And so I'm curious how that's affecting the way that you think about your current portfolio and how you think about your sale and acquisition platform?
Glenn Rufrano: Well, of all the disruptors that are on top of mind today Mitch, it’s certainly the disruptors related to retail. So, let me start there. Capitalism is a hard system. Retail has to be one of the most capitalist business there is. You either fail or win and that's been that way for many, many years. Today, if we look at the disruptors, we have to think about omnichannel and the different method of merchandising. We have tenants that don't embrace omnichannel. We have tenants that can’t afford omnichannel and then we have tenants who can embrace and afford it. The first two, we're not interested in.  The third one, we really care about and how that disruptor affects our tenants. But the second very important part in retail and in disruptors is just true retail value. Put omnichannel aside, for a very long time, we've talked about a retailer having to provide value and that's merchandise, price and service. What we care about here is we’ll be looking at categories and tenants that both can service omnichannel distribution, but as important, can provide value to the clientele.  When we look at our merchandise groups, we're comfortable with our merchandise groups that we're focused on and we have dominance in, discount, grocer, pharmacy, Home and Garden, convenience and within each one, we want the tenants that can afford to pay for omnichannel distribution and provide value. So that would be the number one disruptor that we talked about and that concept is extremely important in both dispositions in what we're selling, we want to dispose, the tenants cannot provide the services and we want to acquire the tenants that can provide those services.  In terms of other property types, clearly office and industrial, we will be very careful. We’re not buying office, as you know, but we have been selling office and we want to make sure our office tenants who don't -- our office properties that don't conform to the disruptors not enough parking. Not functional space, we're going to sell those and we're going to be very careful in acquiring any industrial property to make sure it's functional relative to the new age of physical plant.
Mitch Germain: Great. That's helpful. The improvement in the Red Lobster brand and sales, does that change your thinking about how you think about capping the revenues from that -- for the rents from that customers?
Glenn Rufrano: We like what's going on at Red Lobster in that right now and need to tell you, but we are going to be committed to diversification. We don't really want tenants over 5% and so we will bring it down. We will bring it down, we'd like to get it down to 6% by the end of the year. We sold 132 million. Our goal this year was 200 to 250. So you can see we're well on our way.  We've sold $805 million dollars of Red Lobsters of the 1.6 billion. We will have by the end of this year gotten close to $1 billion in sales. Once we get to that 5% plus or minus, then we'll hold Red Lobster and we'll watch it every day, but we'll hold it, but we're not -- we're going to conform to our general concepts of diversification just because we're not smart enough to know who's good and who's bad five years from now.
Mitch Germain: Great. Last one from me. Guidance, you started the year at $0.19, just, it seems like if I’m thinking about this the right way, you’re at the higher end, if not even above it, what could go wrong to get you below 73?
Mike Bartolotta: Well, let's just, it was a good quarter and we're happy with that. One of the 19, we’d love the 19, but we have projected more dispositions in the beginning of the year and acquisitions tail ended and that will reduce that number. So the capital allocation alone will cause that to drop a bit and then we would hope obviously it picks up again once those acquisitions kick in, assuming we find the properties we want. What could affect it is credit. Do we have some tenants that then go bankrupt other than we have minor issues now as you know one, Gander Mountain [indiscernible], none of which are major components of revenue, all of which we're working on. We don't see other tenants. We don't see other credit issues right now. That would be the cause of it. But we just don't see it right now.
Operator: And our next questioner is going to be Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Chris Lucas: Glenn, just kind of following up on a little bit on the last question, but really on your comment about the probability weighted risk going from 180 basis points to 200 basis points. Is that a function of an add to the list of concerns or just an increase in the probability of concerns?
Glenn Rufrano: We had two small adds that we're not sure that -- which do not have high probabilities, but we just thought prudent to add.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then as it relates to Cetera, I know they’ve been on since January. I guess I'm curious as to whether or not you're getting any traction at this point with the sales team and whether or not their share of sales has picked up at all since January?
Glenn Rufrano: The first product they took Chris was INEP. And they're just starting to pick -- we are just starting to get sales in over the last two months. CCPT5, they have just picked up, have not -- we have not had any sales, but we do expect sales over the second, third and fourth quarter. So it is just beginning for Cetera.
Chris Lucas: Okay. And then last question for me is just related to the transactional market, your peer announced that they had walked away from their pipeline recently. Just curious as to whether or not that had any impact on deals you were working on, either on the disposition or acquisition side?
Glenn Rufrano: I'm not sure of the exact transactions and I really don't know the answers to that Chris. We're looking at our own pipeline and our own acquisition activity and as you can see, it’s 100 million, a little less than what some of our peers that I've seen have done, but that’s had no concern to me at all. We're only going to buy if we like it. So I don't really have an answer in terms of whether or not someone walking away affected the market.
Operator: And our next questioner today is Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your questions.
Joshua Dennerlein: Curious to know, so it sounds like at the end of this year, you’re going to just call market and buy -- for the internal value of it. How would you think about the value of the firm and potentially selling that? I mean when I look at it, cost of equity is compared and then on the debt side, you’re going to have to turn out the debt and going to be rolling up on interest rates. So just wondering how you would think about potentially selling the company and walking away?
Glenn Rufrano: Selling the company meaning Cole, just -- 
Joshua Dennerlein: No. Like VEREIT in general.
Glenn Rufrano: So no, that’s fine. I mean the first thing I’d say is we will always care about the value of the company and if someone were to come along and want to buy the company at a price that we thought was a very good price, there's no social issues around that and it’s a board decision, it's not my decision, but I'm sure our board would look favorably upon real good value for this company if it could be achieved. In terms of acquiring an enterprise like this relative to the debt, it would be just the normal covenants and restrictions that any company would go through. We wouldn't have anything here that’s any different or special.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. Is there anything you would want to clean up beforehand, so to maximize the value of VEREIT outside of Cole?
Glenn Rufrano: Well, anything that we want to clean up, we clean up regardless of buyer. That’s just what we have to do on an everyday basis. So we've given a business plan as you know. We've accomplished a good part of that. We've provided guidance for the year, which we think is very reasonable. We want to make that guidance, we want to do it in the right way. Those are our tours. That's what we'll do.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay. And one last question. Would you, I mean -- would you go around shopping yourself or would it have to be someone coming to you?
Glenn Rufrano: Let's just say that, I was around when we sold new plants in April of 2007. It’s a $6 billion company. Let's just say I know enough and that we have enough experience people to know if there was something to be done, how to do it.
Operator: And the next question today will come from Anthony Paolone with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Anthony Paolone: Thank you. So the stock market is pretty negative on retail related stuff. And I'm wondering as you look in the private markets for small asset, net lease properties, which has historically attracted a lot of individual investors and small groups because of its small ticket price, has any of that narrative seeped into that market, are you seeing anything there that's causing any buyer groups to come step back?
Glenn Rufrano: I would tell you, as we look at the acquisitions we’re seeing today, I’ve not seen a lot of pricing differential. Really, so the answer in the private market as of now, it's not reacted anywhere close to what we're seeing the public market doing there as we speak. It's clear larger deals could have a little more discount than smaller deals, but other than that, not on lot.  Now, maybe it will happen, what -- and I'm going to talk about us, what I like about our business as compared to and as we talk about retailers as compared to being in the shopping center of the business, the mall business and those businesses are -- not being negative on those businesses, if you buy a shopping center, you buy a mall, you buy everything in it. What I like about the single tenant market is we buy a single tenant, we buy a single category. We don't have to take what comes along with it. So we can make sure that whatever we're buying and whatever we're paying makes sense relatives to the portfolio.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. And then you reiterated your plans on the acquisition disposition side for this year. Is there a point at which the stock price affects your thoughts on what you're doing there?
Glenn Rufrano: We're still funding this year. We’re at 5.5 as Mike and I indicated on our net debt to EBITDA on target of 5.7 to 6. So we’re a bit below that. So we have plenty of firepower to stay within our leverage neutral concept and internally fund acquisitions. So we're not concerned with that right now. Our job this year is to dispose of assets that will create more diversification for us and buy assets to fortify the portfolio.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. And then what does it take to get on the watchlist for you all?
Glenn Rufrano: I think not a lot. I think we're going to be very cautious these days. We have a function as you would expect, a credit function that’s following all our credit. If it's a public company, as I mentioned, we have a lot of public companies in retail. We're following them every quarter. We're reading anything we can in the newspapers about them. On our private companies, we do get financials. We're reviewing them every quarter or quicker, so that any time that we hear or see of an issue relative to debt covenants, a purchase an M&A transaction, we will look at all those factors and taken them into consideration.
Anthony Paolone: Okay. And then just last question for a non-warrior, what are the potential outcomes of the May 16 conference decided?
Glenn Rufrano: Well, the conference on May 16 centers around class certification and the judge can’t rule in the case or not. The judge can ask for more discovery relative to class certification or not. We'll have to wait and see.
Anthony Paolone: When you say rule on the case, you mean actually --
Glenn Rufrano: Rule that the class has been accepted or not.
Operator: There look to be no further questions. So this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Glenn Rufrano for any closing remarks.
Glenn Rufrano: I thank everybody for joining us today. We look forward to going ICSC and meeting with people in NAREIT and talking about what we found. Thank you very much.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you all for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the VEREIT 2016 Fourth Quarter and Year End Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bonni Rosen, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Bonni Rosen: Thank you. Thank you for joining us today for the VEREIT 2016 fourth quarter and yearend earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Rufrano, our Chief Executive Officer and Mike Bartolotta, our Chief Financial Officer. Today’s call is being webcast on our website at vereit.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at approximately 12:00 PM Eastern Time today. Dial-in for the replay is 1-877-344-7529, with a confirmation code of 10099562. Before I turn the call over to Glenn, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements in this earnings and business update call, which are not historical facts, will be forward-looking. VEREIT’s actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Annual Report filed today. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports, VEREIT disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as expressly required by law. Let me quickly review the format of today’s call. First, Glenn will begin by providing a business and operational update, followed by Mike presenting our quarterly and yearend financial results. Glenn will then discuss 2017 guidance and highlights of our diversified portfolio. We will conclude today’s call by opening the line for questions. Glenn?
Glenn Rufrano: Thanks, Bonni. And thanks for joining our call today. In 2016 we substantially achieved the core components of our business plan that we outlined in August, 2015 and in certain areas exceeded expectations. Let me begin by highlighting a few accomplishments. As AFFO per diluted share for the year was $0.78 within our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.78. We completed $1.14 billion of dispositions were totaled nearly $2.6 billion since 2015, exceeding the top end of our original guidance by $400 million. Our balance sheet is stronger reflected by a reduction in our net debt to normalized EBITDA to 5.7 times better than the projected range of 6 to 7 and we received investment grade rating on our debt from both S&P and Fitch. Cole Capital finished the year ranked number four for non-listed REIT capital raise up from 13 in 2015. These achievements allowed us to go on the offense during the fourth quarter acquiring $80 million of assets on a leverage neutral basis. We’re pleased with our operations for the year with occupancy ending at 98.3% same store rent was up 0.1% reduced from 0.8% due to the impact of the Ovation bankruptcy. In 2016, we had 4.9 million square feet of leasing activity of which 3.6 million square feet were early renewals with tenants including T-Mobile, Abbott Labs, Del Monte and Netflix. The remaining 1.3 million square feet were 2016 vacancies or expirations. Of the early renewals, we recaptured 96% of the prior rents which will have a short-term effect on same store, for the 2016 vacancy and expirations we captured 99% of prior rent. Approximately 75% of this leasing activity was office and industrial. Our portfolio diversification was further enhanced as we implemented our calling process. At year end property type diversification was 62.6% retail, 15.6% industrial and 21.8% office. We continue to focus on our goal of reducing office exposure below 20%. Additionally our exposure to Red Lobster declined to 8.2% and we’ll continue to disposition process. Our top 10 tenants represent 30.2% which is among the lowest concentration in the industry. $395 million of assets were sold in the fourth quarter bringing the total for 2016 to $1.14 billion and an average cash cap rate of 6.9%. This surpassed the high end of our $800 million to $1 billion guidance range for the year and is an addition to the $1.4 billion of asset sales in 2015. During the past few years we’ve made significant progress with strategic dispositions primarily across our targeted categories. $123 million of retail joint ventures, $681 million of flat lease properties, $674 million of Red Lobster sales, $725 million of office properties and $325 million of non-core assets. With our balance sheet metrics inline we’ve been recycling assets and creating internal capital to fortifying diversify the portfolio through retail and industrial acquisitions. Our retail focus is on the off price sector including traditional and specially grocers, Select Sporting Goods UDA’s [ph] Furniture, pet supplies, arts and craft, home improvement and fitness. For instance during the quarter, we acquired seven properties which included tenants in the above categories. Our industrial focus is on location, physical functionality and appropriate tendencies represented by the Best Buy distribution center we acquired last week. During the fourth quarter Cole Capital raised $67.5 million of new equity an average of $22.5 million a month. For the year the Cole REIT’s rate $487 million just below our $500 million guidance in a year when the industry’s projected capital rate was down nearly 55%. Cole was able to increase its market share to 10.8% resulting in a number for yearend sponsor ranking according to Stanger. New equity for January was $21 million which continues to reflect the initial ramp up of CCIP/3. Cole made significant progress on the broker-dealer front in 2016 and into early 2017 signing any new product selling agreements including 16 for CCIP/3. Additionally to Tara Financial Group which was a top three producer in 2014 recently began selling Cole products. Before Mike reviews our financial results let me provide a brief update on litigation. The court held the status conference in January during which resolving number of outstanding issues related to document production and set a schedule for the parties to file briefs addressing the issue of class certification. A following conference is scheduled with the court on May 16. Additional details regarding pending litigations can be found in our 10-K filed today. Let me now turn over the call to Mike.
Mike Bartolotta: Thanks Glenn and thank you all for joining us today. We finished the year end on plan achieving AFFO of $0.78 per diluted share with $0.17 coming from the fourth quarter. During the quarter consolidated revenue was $351.9 million slightly below Q3 revenue of $362.9 million as we continue to successfully implement our disposition program. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $118.2 million versus net income of $30.2 million for the third quarter representing a difference of $148.4 million. However included in Q4 net loss was a number of non-operational charges including $120.9 million of Cole Capital goodwill impairment charge, $10.2 million relating to the increase write-off of program development cost and $5.2 million of compensation related charges, all of which resulted from a slower than originally anticipated capital raise for Cole this year. In addition, as we noted in our last call in Q3 we had a net gain on the disposition of property sold for that quarter of $28.1 million whereas in Q4, property sold resulted in a minor loss of $0.2 million or negative quarter-to-quarter charge of $28.3 million. It should be noted that for the full year 2016 the gain of disposition real estate sold and held for sale assets is $45.5 million. Lastly both Q4 tax expense and interest expense were more favorable than Q3 by $6.7 million and $5.3 million respectively. If you were to adjust all of these items, you will see a positive net income essentially the same as Q3. Well Cole has done a good job re-establishing its brand and raising capital. The industry environment has been difficult to predict leading us to reduce projections, which resulted in the 2016 goodwill impairment charge. FFO per diluted share for the fourth quarter was $0.05 as compared to $0.19 for the third quarter due to slightly lower revenue, the goodwill impairment charge. The increase in program development cost write-off just discussed and the dilutive effects of our recent equity offering at August. AFFO was $0.17 per diluted share as compared to $0.20 for the third quarter primarily due to slightly lower revenue, the reversal of $9.2 million tax benefit received last quarter driven by the closing of CCIP/2’s offering. The increase write-off for the development cost along with some unusual charges including in G&A which we’ll discuss net, partially offset by reduced interest expense. G&A for the quarter was $44.4 million versus $29.8 million in the third quarter representing an increase of $14.6 million, due primarily to the $15.4 million of non-operational items previously noted. Real estate G&A was $13.3 million for the quarter up $1.2 million from the $12.1 million in the prior quarter mostly due to normal year end activity. Cole Capital G&A was $31.1 million up $13.4 million from $17.7 million in Q3 primarily due to the $10.1 million increased write-off for the development cost and the $5.2 million of compensation related charges. Recurring CapEx was $16.6 million for the year which was lower than our anticipated range of $20 million to $25 million. In part some of that capital spend will occur in 2017 and an additional amount will fall into the year due to the lease renewals that Glenn mentioned earlier. Given these factors our 2007 estimate for recurring CapEx was $30 million to $35 million which during the two year period with average approximately $20 million to $25 million. Cost related to the matters arising from the audit committee investigation which are included in litigation, merger and other non-routine cost were approximately $10.8 million for the quarter. This brings the total legal cost related to these matters to $24.2 million for the year excluding any insurance proceeds which was lower than our last guidance range of $30 million to $35 million. Our estimate for 2017 gross legal cost is $45 million to $50 million excluding any insurance proceeds. Turning to our fourth quarter real estate activity, we sold 78 properties for $394.9 million at an average cash cap rate of 7.4% and a pre-goodwill allocation gain of $17.7 million which is reduced to a loss of approximately by $1 million after goodwill. Subsequent to the quarter the company disposed of 19 properties for an aggregate sales price of $62.3 million. Additionally during the fourth quarter the company acquired seven properties for $80.2 million at an average cash cap rate of 6.7%. During 2016 the company acquired eight properties for approximately $100.2 million at an average cash cap rate of 6.8%. Subsequent to the quarter the company acquired one property for $46 million in addition, we purchased the fee interest in three properties for $20.2 million in which we already own the leaseholds. As of 12/31 our net debt to EBITDA remained at 5.7 times same as last quarter, our fixed charge coverage ratio was a healthy 2.9 times and our net debt to gross real estate investment ratio was just under 40%. Our unencumbered asset ratio was 66% and that our weighted average duration of our debt was 4.4 years. We had $420.2 million of first mortgages and other secure debt coming due in 2017 of which $125.4 million was repaid during 2016. As a remainder comes due, we will use available cash flow in our revolving line of credit and expect to eventually term out the new exposures with unsecured debt. And as a reminder, we have essentially no floating debt. During 2016, we significantly transformed our capital structure and put ourselves in a safe and stable position going forward. We’ve brought our net debt down from $8 billion to $6.1 billion, we decrease the net debt to EBITDA from 7 times to 5.7 times. We issued $1 billion of unsecured senior notes and $702.5 million of equity to prepay the bonds that were expiring at February of 2017 and partially pay down our term loan as well. We lengthened our debt duration and created a well-staggered maturity schedule. We increased our liquidity and we now have full capacity on our revolving line of credit of $2.3 billion and we established a continuous equity program or ATM with an aggregate gross sales price of up to $250 million available through September 2019. These accomplishments along with the overall implementation of the business plan resulted in investment grade rating much sooner than originally anticipated. And with that, I’ll turn the call back to Glenn.
Glenn Rufrano: Thanks, Mike. Let me turn to guidance for 2017. The AFFO per share between $0.70 and $0.73 which includes to $0.02 to $0.03 for Cole Capital. Dispositions and acquisitions each totaling $450 million to $600 million at cap rates ranging from 6.5 to 7.5 with dispositions more front end loaded and acquisitions back end loaded. Net debt to EBITDA in the target range of 5.7 to 6.0 real estate operations with average occupancy approximating 98% and same store rental growth approximating 0.5%. Cole Capital equity raised between $400 million and $500 million and $800 million to being of acquisitions on behalf of the Cole REITs. Diversification is one of our portfolios core attributes and we’ll continue strengthening it through the year. At approximately 63%, retailers are largest property types which includes restaurants at 24%, excluding restaurants retail has six of our top 10 tenants as well as highest occupancy at 99.7%. The largest retail component discount at 7.8% and exposures concentrated in family dollar general and also includes Wal-Mart and T.J. Maxx. Pharmacy comprise of 7.2% as primarily Walgreens and CBS. Grocery is 4.9% and our exposure includes average Albertsons, Kroger, Publix and Stop and Shop. Home and garden is 4.4% with the largest tenants being Tractor Supply, Home Depot and Lowe’s. The other retail sectors are approximately 2% or less. As you can see our retail has strong credits 47% of income from investment grade tenants. The past year we’ve seen a number of retailer issues some financial other structural. Focusing on those, let’s look at what’s not in our portfolio. Traditional department stores, such as Penny, Macy’s and Sears. We do have Cole’s which is investment grade and is less than 1%. In apparel we have no exposure to [indiscernible] Limited or American Eagle and [technical difficulty] With regards to sporting goods our portfolio does not include Sports Authority or Eastern Mountain Sports Stores and we have only one Gander Mountain. We look at electronics which is less than 1% our primary tenant is investment grade rated Best Buy. Combined hhgregg and KANs are only 0.3%. Casual dining comprises 15.6% of the portfolio. We have many major tenants in that roster. Red Lobster which has performed well represents 8.2% of the remainder Applebee’s is next at 1.6%. We also have brand name such as Olive Garden, Cracker Barrel and Outback all under 1%. Nearly 100% of our restaurant leases are triple net more than 90% have contractual rental growth and the average lease term is 14 years. We have provided an update on occupancy cost for retail and restaurant tenants and are supplemental and you’ll see they are well within the range of affordability. As we’ve outlined today, our focus on VEREIT is provide a safe balance sheet with a stable diversified and growing portfolio. We believe this is an attractive proposition for a reasonable portion of the real estate investment market. We will continue to monitor the economic environment and make sure we’re on the right course, but our foundation and strategy are both solidly in place. In closing, on behalf of the board I would like to thank Bruce Frank for his instrumental role and contributions to the company and we’re pleased to welcome Mary Hogan Preusse and Richard Lieb to the board. With that, I’ll open the call for further questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] and the first question comes from Andrew Rosivach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Andrew Rosivach: Thanks for your comment on retail. There’s a rumor that you know a lot about the industry. I’m just curious we’ve always had in net lease this kind of bias of lower cap rates and lower exposure to retail is potentially being positive, one of your own goals is to reduce the office exposure. I’m just curious given the pressures that we were having in the industry could that potentially change especially what you guys are looking and doing on the buy side.
Glenn Rufrano: It’s a real good question Andy. In many meetings I’ve been asked about the three property types and I’ve had and I’m going to call some younger people come in say, isn’t office at a favor today and retail is in favor and my answer is generally been, that may be right today, but if you were older like I am, you’d realize that at times offices in favor and out of favor, industrial is in favour and out of favor and retail is in favor and out of favor. We’re moving in one of those directions as we speak. We clearly had a bit more retailers problems and rightfully so caused by the internet and we’re seeing some structural changes and also some financial changes, but that’s natural it’s going to happen. I’m not sure any of us is smarter enough to know over the long periods of time which of these sectors will be in favor and out of favor. But I do know if we diversify and we have good real estate in those sector we have a better, stronger portfolio. To your point I think, on retail we did spend some more time on retail because of what has been going on in the business and I have been let time it in and it’s very important to understand our credits. So as a simple answer, Andy we think that three property types in proportion that we have make sense. We’re not smart enough to know in any given time what’s in favor, not in favor but if we have good fundamental real estate and good diversification we will have a long-term stable portfolio.
Andrew Rosivach: Understood and just as a follow-up, within that lease is - are broader concerns about retail starting to get priced in higher retail cap rates?
Glenn Rufrano: They maybe, although I’m not sure we’ve seen them yet. I think the quality differences are very important in that equation. I personally still would believe in high quality retail or some old shopping center or single tenant and if the market booked at that way, I don’t think there will be much difference. What I do believe is happening is that if you start talking and be in certainly C levels, there is a large divergence than we’ve seen in the past.
Andrew Rosivach: Got it, thank you sir.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Paolone with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
Anthony Paolone: As you look to do acquisitions in 2017, where do you see the best values right now, where do you see the most compelling buys, whether it’s investment grade, non-investment grade, property type or certain type of tenant industry?
Glenn Rufrano: Well Anthony, if we break down our thoughts on acquisitions because we’re lightning up in office. We will not be in the acquisition mode, certainly we’re in - for office now and our restaurant exposure certainly in dining mostly because the Red Lobster puts into position where we would not - for diversification purposes be buying restaurant. So if we eliminate those we’re back to retail in many of the areas that I just talked about and industrial. If I stayed with industrial we did purchase just close last week, at 1 million square foot Best Buy industrial distribution plant North of Columbus at 7.1 cap rate and we believe we can find some industrial although hard, which can provide value. There we have to look to credit, but also the physical nature of the plant and location. If we can find the right fundamentals we believe there are some value in industrial although it’s not going to be easy to find. In the retail front, as we just talked about we’re in the off price sector, we’re in the necessity shopping sector and we do believe there’s some retail that couple provide value. It could be in primary or secondary markets as long as the credit in the demographic fit the merchandising of the tenant. So we’re going to be as concerned about whether that tenant can merchandise properly to the demographics as we all are, whether it’s a primary market or a secondary market and in those categories that I went through you’re starting with grocer and Select Sports has beauty and so forth, we do believe there is some value in there that we can take advantage of especially with the acquisitions arms that we have and have had over the years, where we believe we have very good ability to look at the market and integrate. For instance let me just update part of your question, can you access the market? We have $21.6 billion of opportunities in 2016 brought to us, we closed $760 million. With those opportunities and the categories we see, we do believe we can find value.
Anthony Paolone: Okay, thanks and then in guidance. Is there much contemplated as it relates to the balance sheet. I don’t know if you have lot to do this year, but would anything - now that you assume there.
Mike Bartolotta: No I mean, the balance sheet in 2017 Anthony, its Mike. We don’t have about little less than $300 million of mortgages that are going to turn and we’ll put those mortgages as they turn onto our line and eventually, when we have the right size number we’ll take out in a unsecured bond. So we will start to look at, we have some converts that are coming due in February of 18, so we will start to look at those potentially some time later in the year and we also have about $500 million of our term debt that converts in 18, but has a one-year extension. So I think what we have right now is some optionality [ph] to look at some things a little bit longer out than one-year and we will be looking at them. But we can act or not act depending on what the market does.
Anthony Paolone: Okay, thanks and then, last couple questions on Cole. I need to get to your capital raising goals it’s almost doubling the pace you guys saw in January. How comfortable are you with that? Like what kind of gives you comfort on that front?
Glenn Rufrano: Well in part, Anthony we don’t have CCIP/3 on track yet and we do expect that will come on, as I mentioned, we had 16 new selling agreements for CCIP/3 that just came on at the end of the last year, so they sure start picking this up this year. We also are excited about having Cetera back on. Cetera has over 7,000 advisors and when they were in the top three with Cole in 2014, it has been a great platform for us and they just came on, we actually sold our first product with them two days ago. So the culmination of CCIP/3 Cetera and we’re continuing to work with some of the larger broker-dealer platforms. Would give us some comfort we can increase throughput through this year - variable is the market and we don’t forget about that. Stanger is projecting $5.8 billion this year from the $4.5 billion last year. Blackstone has a good part of that, but there is some increase expected. Some increase in the market, some increase in our advisors coming on and CCIP/3 gives us some comfort that we can reach those goals.
Anthony Paolone: Okay thanks and then just last one on Cole. Longer term any change in terms of how you think about that business fitting in, with the rest of the company especially you mentioned Blackstone it seems like others would like to be in that space overtime. Does it make you change your thoughts on where to go with the business?
Glenn Rufrano: We continue to start with, let’s make it as valuable as possible and we’re making some good headway there. I wish the market was better. When you have a better oiled machine in a better market, it’s easier to make a decision on value and whether or not it’s value to the public company in its stock price, is adequate. We think we have a little more room in 2017 to improve Cole especially by bringing some larger platforms. We may be in a position later on or at some point this year to understand how the public market is valuing yet relative to us, which will be a very important element in terms of, how we see ourselves long-term.
Anthony Paolone: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.
Operator: Our last question is from Vineet Khanna with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Vineet Khanna: Glenn just going on that line of thought for Cole. Can you talk about - Blackstone is obviously going through the wirehouse is that something that would be of interest to Cole as you sort of look to expand?
Glenn Rufrano: It certainly would be, but what Blackstone has done is been really very good, we hope for the whole industry having the wirehouses sell their product, we would like to piggyback on that very frankly, that would be very good for us and we continue to work with the wirehouses as we do the larger broker-dealers to help us sell more product overtime.
Vineet Khanna: Okay and then just on last one on Cole here. Just have you seen any impacts sort of from the uncertainty that’s come up around the fiduciary rule, I mean clearly you were able to bring Cetera on forward, but have there any other sort of issues with the broker-dealers as a result of questions around the fiduciary rule?
Glenn Rufrano: I think we’d all agree that fiduciary rule is a good thing, people should be fiduciaries. The problem has been the definition of the fiduciary. What has been happening is, in light of poor definition in my view from the deal on that. The broker-dealer themselves have been creating definitions that they believe work and that’s going to be very helpful this year. For instance, if you have INEP product with no commission that’s an easy choice, but T shares under certain circumstances now are being considered applicable to that rule, so it’s working its way through the system as we speak larger companies have come up with their own internal proposals on how to meet that rule and as those decisions get made, it will help us move forward in 2017.
Vineet Khanna: Okay great and then just shifting to sort of the real estate side of things. On the acquisition front in 2017, is there any build-to-suit contemplated, I mean you’ve got sort of the cap lease stuff that you guys acquired long ago, is that something that’s sort of under consideration at this point.
Glenn Rufrano: I’m sorry, did you say disposition or acquisition?
Vineet Khanna: Acquisition, as it pertains to sort of build-to-suit.
Glenn Rufrano: I see. We have been looking at a number build-to-suits, especially in the industrial area. Internally we have a - it’s a small construction group, so that we can monitor construction overtime and we can be pure takeout from a construction loan or we could actually fund along the way and with our internal group and perhaps an outside consultant. Make sure, we’re funding adequately for the ultimate takeout. As I speak to Paul and Tom about those that business, we can see that build-to-suit is a 50 basis point in many cases increase over a normal cap rate and if we can minimize the risk to get there it’s a very good way for us to move forward and we’re looking at number of those transactions right now.
Vineet Khanna: Okay great and then just last from me, thanks for the update on the sort of the litigation. What are the prospects for settlement before the May meeting date?
Glenn Rufrano: We have our General Counsel in the room, who’s - can’t give an answer. I don’t know and I’m sorry Vineet it’s one of those things, I’d have to kill, if I knew. So realistically it’s and I don’t mean to make joke of it, it’s very important but it’s not something that we can have a discussion on.
Vineet Khanna: Okay, well I appreciate the consideration and thanks for the time.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Michael Knott: Just question for you on your anticipated acquisition, disposition guidance number for 2017. Just curious if you feel like those are light particularly on one side or the other and then maybe can you just give a little bit more color on your comment on the front end loaded and back end loaded with respect to those and the thought process behind that?
Glenn Rufrano: Sure. I’ll start with dispositions. We’re just - as we’ve been focused on dispositions Michael as you know, the dispositions that we’re targeting in 2017 are office to get that 20% below number and Red Lobster so it’s a very focused approach with those two and we will always have some non-core that we believe putting capital into would not make sense. So we’ll have those category, so it’s very specific and we feel pretty good about the numbers, the 450 to 600 surrounding those specific categories. In terms of acquisitions and I think we’ve had this conversation in 17 years as a CEO I’ve never given acquisition guidance. But in our business which is very acquisition-oriented that didn’t seem to make much sense. So we spent a good amount of time looking at our acquisition, you see we had some acquisitions to-date and looking at our pipeline and where we are in terms of letters of intent and so forth and so we felt, we should come up with a number that made sense and we think the 450 to 600 make sense, could it be more, if we find appropriate acquisitions it could be more, but we never want to be put in a box. Just like we’re a fund that have three years to invest and if you don’t invest the money you’ll lose it, we don’t want to be that. We’re not a fund that have to invest. We’re public company that invests widely for their shareholders and we’re going to continue with that psyche. In terms of the front end loaded issue with dispositions, we have been disposing for two years, so we have dispositions that we believe will close early on in the year and so those are factual relationships. In terms of acquisitions we just want to be cautious so that we have the appropriate time to make the right decision.
Michael Knott: Okay, that’s really helpful. Thanks and then just curious maybe broadly if you’re seeing any changes in terms of cap rates out there I guess maybe more so on the disposition side for you, since that’s where you’ve been more focused, but just curious what you’re maybe seeing and then maybe any specific comments you could share with respect to, how the market is evaluating Red Lobster pricing today and that opportunity?
Glenn Rufrano: In terms of cap rates, I’ve also felt that equity follows debt and if I pick two points in time, I think we’ve had some big differences here, at the end of last year right after the election rates went up as we all know, but we looked at the absolute rate of increase in the bond market, that wasn’t much spreads came in, in the last half of the year, as a matter of fact in last two months of the year. In fact, there were some large deals done Simon, Kimco did some very large bond transactions at very good absolute rates because spreads came in. mortgage rates didn’t come in at the end of the last year. The mortgage market was at the end of its one-year cycle and spreads didn’t come in at all. And if you tried to get a mortgage in the last two months of last year, you got stuck with another 50 to 70 bps more. I believe and our teams believe because we had this conversation it’s already changed this year. The bottom market is still [indiscernible] because there’s capital there, but the mortgage in the market now has new allocations and the spreads in the market have absolutely come in the last couple of months. And so given that, if we don’t have not seen a lot of change in cap rates currently that would have the equity being led by the debt and on top of that, there seems to be a pretty good flow of capital, so at this time these are generalities that we don’t see big differences in cap rates. If I try to dissect them the way you’ve asked larger deals, portfolio deals could have more of a discount, a little cap rate than smaller deals, but across the board we’re seeing general flatness. And then in terms of Red Lobster, not much changed. I will tell you that, a big trend here that will be important it’s the 1031. In fact just talking to some brokers the other day the 1031 player seem to be running right now to make deals perhaps ahead of what could be a change in the tax code next year. so we have not seen much change, the basic deals are 5.5 to 6 and we spread about a point in our joint venture with Golden Gate and so our effective rates have been closed to 7.
Michael Knott: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mitch Germain at JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Peter on for Mitch. Just curious, could you guys quantify the Red Lobster exposure today and what’s left in the forward sales agreement and then maybe what do you guys think gets done this year versus 2018? Thanks.
Glenn Rufrano: In terms of the dispositions, we closed about $246 million last year and we think it will be somewhere in the $200 million, $250 million range this year. So that’s how we would quantify what we think we could do. As of now, the effective cap rate 7% that’s realistic for the $250 million for this year. Was that was the primary question? Did I miss the second question?
Unidentified Analyst: No, that was it. Just what do you guys think gets done this year and then what would be left for 2018?
Glenn Rufrano: If we get to where we want to get to this year, we should be in the 6%, 6.5% range somewhere like that which would mean we may have a little left because we like 5% as a goal, we could have some left in 2018, but we don’t think a lot.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joshua Dennerlein: I’m curious on how you think about the double net leases in your portfolio. Is that something that would perhaps fall under your disposition bucket or something that move away from overtime? I don’t know you would stay in your acquisitions.
Glenn Rufrano: It’s always a question of risk reward. When you’re buying asset that’s triple net there’s a risk that’s different from double net. Double net just means in many cases roof [ph] parking lots and so forth. We are fully equipped as a full service real estate operating company to know and understand roofs [ph] and parking lots and so we don’t have a concern relative to having to buy or sell something that’s double net, that is not going to fall in the question because we know how to manage it. We just want to make sure that the risk return relationship makes sense and as you know, it’s far different a double net is far different than running a shopping center or a mall or multi-family property. So we’re very comfortable with double net, we’ll look at both and it’s just a question of the risk return and whether or not we’re being paid for that risk and whether we could manage that risk which we believe, we can do.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay, thanks and then on the fee and leasehold consolidation that you did on three properties in 4Q, are there more of those in the portfolio? And just how the economic for that works? You guys own the land book or then that you own everything or?
Glenn Rufrano: Sure just to define, these are three properties. We own the leasehold subject to ground lease payment. The ground lessor came to us and asked that we consider buying the fee and I wish we had a lot of them, we love that. We don’t have many more. What we did here was, we bought the fees on the three properties at a 5.5% cap rate but that allowed us to merge the fee and leasehold interest in our view create value and more importantly two of those three properties were properties in which we renegotiated long-term leases, one of its Del Monte, one of Nesli [ph]. So we were able to buy the fee, negotiate a long-term lease, merge the two estates and create significant value for those properties.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay thanks and then just one question on the same store rent guidance of 0.5%. Does that include the Ovation bankruptcy still or anything kind of holding that back?
Glenn Rufrano: No that includes the Ovation bankruptcy.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay, do you know that number without the Ovation bankruptcy?
Glenn Rufrano: It would be a bit higher but not dramatically because it will only effect in the first quarter.
Joshua Dennerlein: Okay, all right. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Well I guess first on the balance sheet, you guys have done a remarkable job bringing down your debt EBITDA bringing down your leverage, you’re not sitting at 5,7 net debt-to-EBITDA. Just curious on your inclination perhaps to incur a bit more leverage for some acquisitions given the improvement in the balance sheet but also given what the stock price is?
Glenn Rufrano: We’ve reflected the target this year of 5, 7 to 6. And where we think we’d like to stay with that ratio. Mike tell us, I think we’re BBB, what do you think?
Mike Bartolotta: No I think we’re BBB obviously two out of the three and rated us, basically the equivalent of BBB negative and I think of in lieu of passage of time, hopefully short time we’ll get the BBB. But I think if we’re there where we need to be and so I would not see us taking on significantly more debt, we’ll do things in a leverage neutral basis going forward, but staying at a BBB level.
Glenn Rufrano: Okay and then as you can see part an earlier question was the matching of disposition and acquisitions and so we’re creating our own internal capital to match the acquisition program selling assets that will provide us better diversification in buying assets to strengthen portfolio in that process, we do not have to increase it.
Unidentified Analyst: Appreciate that. So, maybe a bit more discussion around the retail tenant watch list today beyond the more obvious hhgregg and Gander any other kind of incrementally on that list today and then maybe you can share a few names or perhaps sometimes that you’re perhaps concerned about.
Glenn Rufrano: We do - I have it in front of me, we do it each quarter. We’re about on probability weighted basis about 1.8% in terms of where we see rent issues, but it’s really scattered the purpose of actually revealing many of our retailers who I think have some of the issues that we’ve all been talking about earlier is that, we don’t have many we mentioned hhgregg we have six stores it’s very small, we have KANs [ph], we have two stores, we have one Gander Mountain, we talked about Logans that we have seven Logans but we renegotiated those deals, so they’re all set. We have six Ruby Tuesday’s. Ruby Tuesday is non-bankruptcy but there are some issues with them, but they’re very small piece of us and so we don’t have a large concentration tier, it’s a bunch of smaller credits which we care a lot about because we want to make sure we get a re-nickel but I can’t tell you, there’s something, there’s so many on our list that is big.
Unidentified Analyst: Fair enough and then one last one, final I have you. It’s been you’ve accomplished a lot the last couple of years since joining. I’m curious now that you stand here today thinking about where you’re taking the company next you lead out some goals for reduction to certain asset types, tenants, balance sheet but just curious how you see yourself perhaps solving the valuation gap that still exists between you and some of your peers. Beyond obviously the litigation [indiscernible] perhaps you could share some thoughts on strategically the next few milestones that you’re thinking of where you’re taking this company the next couple of years that we should be thinking about.
Glenn Rufrano: Well as you can see what we’ve been focusing on portfolio, portfolio and making sure that it’s well diversified portfolio and balance sheet, balance sheet. Well we continue to work on those two, I would expect that given the right portfolio and we’ll be there soon and the balance sheet we have that we should be in a position which is really a key position for us to start growing AFFO. I mean that’s - I think our guidance this year is reasonable at $0.70 and $0.73 it reflects what we had to do in the balance sheet to get to investment grade we’re there. I was hoping to expect that the gap closes and we’ll continue to close as the market sees us in a position to grow AFFO and we believe this is the year, we should stabilize ourselves.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Glenn Rufrano for any closing remarks.
Glenn Rufrano: Thanks everybody for joining us today and look forward to your thoughts and comments, talk to you soon. Bye now.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Please stand by, we're about to begin. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Janeen Bedard: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter 2016 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be; John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit the during the Q&A portion of the call; in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.
John Case: Thanks, Janeen, and welcome to our call today. We're pleased to report another active quarter for acquisitions. As announced in yesterday's press release we are increasing in our 2016 acquisitions guidance from $1.25 billion to approximately $1.5 billion; and tightening and raising the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance to $2.87 to $2.89 as we anticipate another solid year of earnings growth. After financing 85% of our capital needs since the start of 2015 with equity, we returned to the bond market this month with a $600 million ten-year senior unsecured bond offering at 3.15% which represents the lowest all-in yield in our company's history for ten-year debt transaction. Our balance sheet remains well capitalized and access to our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to pursue the highest quality net lease investments that support our reliable dividend growth. Now let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks, John. I'm going to provide highlights for few items in our financial statements for the quarter starting with the income statement. Interest expense decreased in the quarter by $11 million to $53 million, and year-to-date by $10 million to $171 million. This decrease is partly due to a lower average outstanding debt balance over the past year as we primarily sold common equity and repaid outstanding bonds and mortgages. However, this decrease was also driven by the recognition of a non-cash gain of approximately $2.1 million on interest rates swaps during the quarter which caused a decrease in that liability and lowered our interest expense. And in the comparative third quarter of 2015, we recognized the non-cash loss of approximately $5.2 million that increased our interest expense in that quarter. As a reminder, we do exclude the impact of these non-cash gains and losses to calculate our AFFO. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 4.6% this quarter as we continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector. Year-to-date, our G&A is only 4.9% of revenues and we are still projecting approximately 5% for the year. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.6% this quarter and we are still projecting approximately 1.5% for the year. Provisions for impairment were $8.8 million in the third quarter on 11 sold properties, five properties held for sale, and two properties held for investment. $2 million of this impairment recognized in the quarter relates to the pending sale of our former headquarters office building in Escondido which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Briefly turning to the balance sheet; we've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. We raised approximately $500 million of common equity capital thus far this year, and as John mentioned, we successfully returned to the bond market earlier this month with a $600 million ten-year senior unsecured bond offering with the yield of 3.15%. The offering was well oversubscribed and we were very pleased with the quality of the fixed income investors in the offering. This offering extended the weighted average maturity of our senior unsecured bonds from 6.2 to 6.8 years, and provides us with additional flexibility under our $2 billion revolving credit facility which following the offering has a balance of approximately $470 million. Other than our credit facility the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $32.4 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedules remains in very good shape with only $36 million of mortgages coming due the remainder of this year. And our maturity schedule is well latter thereafter with only $284 million of maturing debt in all of 2017. Finally, our overall leverage remains low with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.3 times. In summary, we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital; both of which remain well priced financing options today. So let me turn the call now back over to John to give you more background.
John Case: Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Our occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, a 30 basis points increase from last quarter. We continue to make good progress with our releasing and sales efforts and expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. On the 47 properties we released during the quarter, we recaptured a 105% of the expiring rent. While we typically do not pay tenant improvements to release assets, we did incur $2.1 million NTIs and $7 million in committed redevelopment capital to release three former Sports Authority properties to a leading national retailer while generating a recapture rate of 136% on these three leases, and an incremental yield on invested capital of 18%. Year-to-date, we have recaptured 104% of expiring rent on 122 lease rollovers which remains well above our long-term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold more than 2,200 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were released. This compares favorably to the handful of net lease companies who also report this metric. Our same-store rent increased 1.1% during the quarter and 1.2% year-to-date. We continue to expect same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties. Approximately 70% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type; all of which contribute to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties released the 247 commercial tenants and 47 different industrials located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There is not much movement in the composition of our top tenants in industries during the third quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7.3% of rental revenue and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. As we discuss our top tenants; I'd like to highlight a positive transaction involving Diageo. Earlier this year, Diageo sold its wine-related businesses in order to exclusively focus on spirits and beer. We own 17 vineyards and wineries in Napa Valley that are leased to Diageo. Diageo sold its operations related to our properties to Treasury Wine Estates, the world's largest publicly traded venture. We and Diageo negotiated a buyout of the guarantee of our leases that have approximately 15 years of remaining term. Diageo was paying Realty Income $75 million in cash in two equal installments in exchange for being released from the guarantee. We received the initial payment in the third quarter and we will receive the second payment in January of 2017. At that time we will fully release Diageo from the guarantee, and Treasury Wine Estates will become our tenant. We believe this is a very attractive transaction for our shareholders for many reasons including; first, the $75 million payment reduces our investment in prime Napa Valley real estate to approximately 50% of current market value. It also increases our yield on our investment to 10.5%. We gain as a top tenant, Treasury Wine Estates, who is an excellent venture with an equity market capitalization of approximately $6.5 billion, who has a strong credit profile. While Treasury does not currently have rated public debt, it has a healthy balance sheet with a debt-to-EBITDA of 1.5 times and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.3 times. It has a singular focus on wine with premier labels such Pin Bowl and Barringer [ph], and added BB and Sterling among others through this transaction. Moving on to tenant credit; we continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 45% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remained sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties increased from 2.7 times to 2.8 times on a four wall basis and the median increased from 2.6 times to 2.7 times in the third quarter. Moving on acquisitions; we completed $410 million in acquisitions during the quarter and through the first nine months of the year, we completed approximately $1.1 billion in acquisitions at record high investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. We continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. Year-to-date, we have sourced $23 billion in acquisition opportunities putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring less than 5% of the amount sourced year-to-date which is consistent with our average since 2010. As I mentioned, we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.5 billion and we continue to acquire the highest quality net lease properties as we grow our portfolio. Now let me hand it over to Sumit who will discuss our acquisitions and dispositions.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John. During the third quarter of 2016, we invested $410 million in 93 properties located in 29 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.4 years. On a revenue basis, 69% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants; 86% of the revenues are generated from retail; and 14% are from industrial. These assets are lease to 23 different tenants in 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are drug stores, discount grocery stores, and automotive services. We closed 20 independent transactions in the third quarter and the average investment of property was approximately $4.4 million. Year-to-date 2016, we invested $1.1 billion in 236 properties located in 36 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 15 years. On a revenue basis 51% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 81% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 19% are from industrial. These assets are lease to 41 different tenants in 24 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are drugstores, casual dining restaurants, and transportation services. Of the 61 independent transactions closed year-to-date, two transactions where about $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy, we sourced approximately $9 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $23 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Off these opportunities, 51% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 49% or approximately $11 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 24% for the third quarter. Off the $410 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 33% were one-off transactions. As to pricing, cap rates remained flat in the third quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter we sold 23 properties for net proceeds of $18.1 million at a net cash cap rate of 9.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 7.4%. This brings us to 49 properties sold year-to-date for $53.2 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.7%, and an unlevered IRR of 8.6%. Our investment spreads relative to a weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 271 basis points in the third quarter which were well above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less on nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. In conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance of 2016 to approximately $1.5 billion. We are also raising our 2016 disposition target to between $75 million and $100 million. With that I'd like to hand it back to John.
John Case: Thanks, Sumit. As mentioned previously, we returned to the bond market earlier this month with a $600 million ten-year benchmark senior unsecured bond offering at a yield-to-maturity at 3.15%. This offering allowed us to term out our loan balance at attractive pricing while repricing our credit curve and the debt capital markets which will have ongoing benefits to the company and future debt offerings. Since the start of 2015 we have issued a total of $2.5 billion of capital. $1.7 billion of this capital raised has been equity, so we have continued to finance our capital needs conservatively. Our leverage remains low with debt-to-total market cap of approximately 23% and debt-to-EBITDA at 5.3 times. Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion of capacity available on our $2 billion line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. Our credit ratings remain BAA1, BBB+ by all three rating agencies with positive outlooks from both, Moody's and S&P; providing us with the highest overall credit ratings in the net lease sector. During the third quarter, we increased the dividend for the 88th time in the company's history. The current annual launched dividend represents a 6% increase over the prior year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our year-to-date AFFO payout ratio is 83.5% which is a level we are quite comfortable with. To wrap it up, we had another productive quarter across all functions of the organization and remain optimistic about our future. As demonstrated by our sector leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in the net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisition environment remains a very efficient marketplace and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest quality properties given our sector leading cost of capital, access to capital, and balance sheet flexibility. At this time I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now go to Robert Stevenson with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Robert Stevenson: Good afternoon, guys. John, once you get the second payment from Diageo, is there anything left to do really with the vineyard, is that a candidate for sale at some point in '17?
John Case: Once we get the second payment in January, Diageo will be fully released and Treasury Wine Estates will become our tenant as I said. This is prime Napa Valley real estate, and our basis relative to value and investment will be about 50%. It's performing quite well for us, 15 years of lease term left. So it's not something we would look to be selling unless we had an offer that was unbelievably attractive but we'll stick with it.
Robert Stevenson: Okay, and then Paul; what were you thinking and how strong the preferred market has been off-late that you guys price a preferred issuance today? What are you thinking about in terms of the series [ph]?
Paul Meurer: I think today you'd be looking at something for us in the 5% to -- 5% and 8% range right around there. So that's very attractive from a historical perspective relative to the preferred market. The preferred asset 6% and 8% as you know and it is callable in mid-February, and that's a decision as we get closer to it that we'll make at that time.
Operator: At this time we'll move to Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Joshua Dennerlein: Could you walk us through your thought process on why you didn't provide 2017 guidance with 3Q results?
John Case: Sure. Basically we thought by providing it in the first quarter we could provide an additional three months of visibility, and that should resolved in guidance that was -- it is more informed. When we looked at what our peers were doing, we saw that 85% of the S&P500 REITs released guidance in the first quarter or not at all. So again, we were bit of an outlier. This is not unlike us changing the month in which we look at our dividend a couple of years ago, our fifth dividend increases; it used to be in August, now it's in January. So we lined it up with our fiscal year. And in an industry like ours, that -- it's largely reliant on external growth to drive overall growth for the company. It is difficult as you all have seen to project acquisitions 15 months out. And so I think it's especially pertinent to our sector. So that's why we decided to release guidance going forward in the first quarter.
Joshua Dennerlein: Got it, thanks. But it looks like you've pulled back on the ATM during the third quarter; any reason for that? And what can we kind of expect for 4Q -- have we used it at all so far?
John Case: So over -- with the twelve-month period ending September 30, we exclusively financed our growth with equity and we've raised -- that's $1.1 billion of equity. We've raised $1.7 billion of equity over the last 20 months and our balance sheet has never been in greater shape than it is today with debt-to-total market cap of approximately 22%, 23%; and a debt-to-EBITDA in the low five, about 5.2, 5.3. So we elected to issue the bond that we referenced in our opening comments and for a number of reasons; one, we had not been in the bond market in two years. And we had an opportunity to reset our pricing by issuing a large liquid benchmark ten-year offering. We actually priced six basis points through our secondary spreads when we priced transaction and we had really incredible demand for the transaction as well. So we didn't want to over equitize, we've raised a lot of equity; we'll continue to look at all sources of financing going forward but the bond -- we could not be more pleased with the $600 million unsecured offering and then what that did for us. So we'll continue to look at equity prices going forward, we'll look at all forms of capital we have with the recent bond offering -- near-term, immediate needs for significant capital.
Operator: We'll take a question from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra: Thank you. I just wanted to understand the rag [ph] exposure. Now given the size, can you maybe give us a sense of how the portfolio looks like in terms of -- what percent has -- what percent of it has rent bumps? Any other interesting differences between the portfolio you can highlight?
John Case: So Vikram, you're talking about the most recent transaction we completed -- it was a…
Vikram Malhotra: Yes, the most recent and then just as the whole -- just as the tenant as a whole.
John Case: Okay. So the most recent transaction, we don't go into lot of detail but I will tell you that it was a negotiated off-market transactions sale leaseback opportunity that we worked on with Walgreens directly based on a relationship. Very attractive properties at -- with an appropriate investment structure; the lease does have growth in it. And it was an attractive investment. So it took us to 7.3% in terms of our overall rent exposure. When assuming in the first quarter and Walgreens expects is they've said publicly that the ready transaction will close; we'll be up to around 9% which is at the high end of where we want to be, be it any single tenet, we feel very comfortable that it's such a strong tenant. But again in this -- for the sake of diversity, we'll manage that exposure, back down a bit through additional growth and some selected asset sales but primarily through additional growth.
Vikram Malhotra: And can you give us some sense of like what percent of the portfolio has rent bumps. How the -- broadly how the coverage looks in terms of -- even if there is a range you can provide us -- just to give us some sense of the different parts of the portfolio -- the different parts of the world mean portfolio?
John Case: Yes, I'd say we have growth on in terms of the Walgreens exposure, it's probably 60% to 70% of the assets. So that's -- there are some that are flat but overall it's about between 60% and 70%. And it's all sale back transactions, not that lease existing transactions.
Operator: And we'll take next question from Vineet Khanna with Capital One Securities.
Vineet Khanna: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. So just on the disposition side, it looks like on a property count basis, 82% of disposition have been vacant properties in '16, 73% in '15 and 35% in 2014. But it just reflects sort of a shift in strategy around dispositions and asset management or as you just said, reflection of tenant fallout here or something like that.
John Case: Well, we're selling more vacant assets that we think we're better-off selling and trying to relax. So we're being more active on that front. And this past year we had two bankruptcy events that we were planning for; that included Ryan's and the Sports Authority, and some of the sales activity had been related to vacant properties for those former tenants, end tenants.
Vineet Khanna: Okay. So no real shift in strategy just sort of a thought.
John Case: Yes, and we'll be a little more active on the disposition front. We are raising our disposition guidance from 50 to 75 for the year, to $75 million to $100 million for the year. And again, we're -- if we have legacy assets that are not consistent with our investment parameters today, we're going to strongly consider selling those assets; some of which are leased but some of which are not leased; and redeploying that capital into assets that better fit our investment strategy and provide our shareholders with a better return.
Operator: At this time we'll go to Nick Joseph with Citi Group.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. Paul, you mentioned the $470 million on the line after the recent debt deals. So I'm wondering how you think about the line and floating rate debt more broadly as part of the capital structure?
Paul Meurer: Historically, once we reached some critical level of borrowings on the line that would be the immediate way to finance the business and finance acquisitions. We then look to the permanent capital markets, mostly equity but also long-term bonds etcetera. But historically aligned with a lot smaller too, so over the past year with a $2 billion line, it gives us a little bit more flexibility to be able to carry a little bit larger balance than we had historically; but on a percentage basis relative to the enterprise as a whole, it's quite similar. So we're not taking on that much more variable rate debt overall in the capital structure. What's good about that -- the ability to carry a $400 million, $500 million, $600 million balance on the line but again isn't taking that much more risk relative to the enterprise as a whole, it gives you almost a free look at the permanent capital markets where you can wait and time when it's appropriate to issue long-term bonds or perhaps common equity. So that's one side benefit of that. Right now sitting here with plus or minus $500 million balance, that kind of gives us that window but it's not one where we're anxious or you know feel the need to immediately issue capital any time soon?
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks for that. And then I guess in terms of cap rates, have you see any changes to cap rates or seller's appetites more broadly, given the economic environment and move -- rates the election or anything else?
John Case: No, cap rates have remained pretty consistent over the last 12 to 15 months. On the investment grade side we're still seeing initial yields in the low fives to the high six's on the non-investment grade side; I'd say the high-five's up into the 8% range. So that's been consistent and it really no reaction in the market to the movement and the tenure at this joint – juncture.
Operator: [Indiscernible] has the next question with Mizuho.
Unidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. I see that your floating rate debt exposure, basically a credit line it was about 20% in the quarter dropping down to about 14%, 15% post the bond issued in October. The question is, given the concern about rising rates is that a level you're comfortable with or should we look for further reduction? And then how you're thinking overall about floating rate exposure at this point in the cycle with rates slightly [ph]?
John Case: So I'll start and Paul, you can elaborate. I think on a $23 billion capital structure, $500 million of floating rate debt is something we're quite comfortable with. So we will have some floating rate outstanding. I mean we're not in the business predicting where interest rates are going to go, I know a year ago people were predicting it would go higher and well, actually -- even after today, well below where they were in December of last year. So that's a pretty dangerous game, I think a lot of us have been expecting -- a lot of people in the marketplace have been expecting rates now to rise for five years after the monetization that took place after the Great Recession. But that really hasn't materialized, we've got 1% plus GDP growth; our tenants are doing well but when we look at their P&Ls, we're not seeing gangbuster growth, we're just seeing moderate solid sales growth. So we're certainly comfortable, gets back to the amount of floating rate debt with $500 million. I mean we're not going to put all of our chips in one interest rate scenario, and we'll remain lowly leverage, very strong balance sheet where the impact of rates will be muted on our own company. Paul, anything you want to add to that?
Paul Meurer: No, that's fine.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. And then if I may, as a follow-up, just -- I know you are giving 2017 guidance but just curious on the competitive environment for the types of acquisitions you're looking at the higher grade type of tenant. Just curious on the competitive environment that you're seeing out there, institutional bids etcetera?
John Case: Sure. There is some level of competition but we're really in a good position to focus on the highest quality net lease properties given our significant cost of capital advantage, size, access to capital, balance sheet flexibility. So we remain very selective and that's been consistent. Going back to probably 2010 we acquired on average about 5% of what we're sourcing. So we're in a position where if we want it, we can generally execute and make the acquisition. So there is competition out there but seldom are we competing with other public companies for transactions, there are some private capital out there and certainly on the higher quality industrial product -- we'll run into some money being managed by investment managers, familiar with the net lease market and that could be pension fund and down and even sovereign wealth money. Not seen much out of the private or non-listed REITs today and really/only compete with maybe one or two other public companies; just on the assets. And then again, that's just given where we're focused versus where some of our peers are focused on the yield risk curve.
Operator: At this time we'll move to RJ [ph] with Baird.
Unidentified Analyst: Good afternoon, guys. Paul, couple of questions for you on the balance sheet; so obviously you guys are discussing how much equity you guys have issued over the past twelve months, and I'm curious how comfortable or what level of leverage you're comfortable bringing the balance sheet up to -- if you choose not to issue additional equity in the next couple of quarters?
Paul Meurer: As a general remark, and we will -- we've stated our philosophy for the balance sheet is kind of roughly two-thirds equity, one-third long-term debt if you will to kind of help people think about how to model us going forward. When equity has been attractively priced as it's been over the past year and a half, we lean more towards doing that, and really exclusively did that for 21/22 months. And as such that brought it down to more or less say 20% debt leverage ratio, but ultimately you want to have the ability to go out more to that 30% to 35% range if you need to -- and if equity for some reason at different points in time is not as attractively priced as it is. But we're very comfortable with where we are right now in that 20% to 25% range. We'd be comfortable going up a little bit higher and have the ability and flexibility to use debt or equity going forward right now.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And Paul, I priced obviously a good ten-year bond offering last quarter, 3.15; I'm curious if you're talking to your bankers, if you think -- where do you think that deal will get pressed today?
Paul Meurer: Right now that same bond is trading at about 137 basis points over. The deal was priced at 147 basis points, so even with the rise in treasuries we're still looking at ten-year money kind of around the same effective yield that we were able to do the transaction a few weeks ago.
Operator: We'll now move along to Karin Ford with MUFG Securities.
Karin Ford: Hi, good afternoon. Investment spreads were 271 basis points this quarter, given that changes in cap rates often times lag changes in the capital markets, where would the spreads need to fall to that would cause you to get more conservative on your investments?
John Case: Karin, over the history of the company, our investment spreads versus our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital have been in the mid-100s. So we've gone as high as 275 basis points which is a record and we've been as low as 75 basis points. It all depends on the growth in assets, I mean we're not just simply looking at the spreads, we certainly want transactions to be accretive but we're also looking at the long-term benefits for the IRR, the growth and the lease. So even we have at least 100 basis points of cushion today before we even hit our average investments spread. So we're in good shape on that front.
Karin Ford: Thanks for that. A second question, was the bond offering anticipated in original guidance? And recognizing that you're not giving 2017 guidance today, do you have any early thoughts as to how AFFO growth maybe setting up for next year compared to this year?
John Case: Well, we don't want to bring it out, guidance -- we feel very good about the business and are seeing very good opportunities going forward. So we do like -- we have a great deal of momentum going into 2017 and it's going to be a good year for the company. But we'll come out as I said and issue formal guidance during the first quarter. And on the bonds; Paul, do you want to address that?
Paul Meurer: We're just in terms of what we expected coming into this year. We did model doing a little bit more leverage and not just all equity, up through the third quarter. And the leverage that we modeled in fact was a little bit wider pricing, we were thrilled with what we're able to execute a few weeks ago. So given the uptick in acquisition activity throughout the year, and the fact that we're now expecting $1.5 billion; had we financed that with rather than 100% equity, financed it with two-thirds equity, one-third debt; we would have come in above our original guidance by a material amount. But what we did is took advantage of attractive equity cost and really fortify the balance sheet; and here today we sit in great shape and as Paul said, we have the flexibility to look at all forms of capital, long-term, as we look at financing the business on a go-forward basis in 2017.
Operator: We'll then move to Daniel Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann.
Daniel Donlan: Thank you. Just wanted to talk about your EBITDA coverage, it was only 2.6 times in the fourth quarter of '15, now it's 2.8. So is that more a function of what you bought or is it more a function of your tenants, your existing tenants gauged wrong.
Paul Meurer: It's either dark growing with our existing tenants for the most part. And I think acquisitions contributed a little bit to that but you know the uptick in this last quarter -- couple of industries, see stores and our tire, auto service. I'll head we saw a good growth in the EBITDAR from all those industries and they were the principal industries that contributed to the increase and are -- both our average and our median EBITDAR coverage ratios.
Daniel Donlan: I appreciate that. And just kind of curious on cap rates and neither if their lease back, basically lease back this quarter -- basically lease back this quarter. What do you think the difference in cap rates is for deals that are maybe ten-years in term versus maybe 15 or even 20-years in term? Is there a pretty big gap there? Just kind of curious on your thoughts.
John Case: There is a gap and I'll hand it over to Sumit. Sumit, you want to take that one?
Sumit Roy: Yes, sure. So it's a function of both, the tenant as well as the lease term. And if you assume that the leases are structured exactly identical and the only delta is going to be the term, I would say between a 10-year and a 20-year lease term, you could potentially have a difference of anywhere between 10 to 25 basis points.
John Case: And we've seen it even as high as 50 in one transaction.
Sumit Roy: If the credit is non-investment grade, yes.
Operator: We will now move to Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: Thanks, guys. It seems like the notion of you guys making large M&A type deals -- that's kind of been taken off the table, we just haven't seen many transformational deals in the net lease space. Can you just comment on how that market looks like right now; you've got year-end coming, investors and portfolio managers have tax deadline. How does the M&A market look like right now?
John Case: The M&A market has been pretty slow as of -- observed it across the sectors. We're not going to -- I'm not in a position to speculate on what may or may not happen in our own sector. So I don't want to make any comments around that.
Todd Stender: Sure. And then maybe just going back to kind of the -- the lease renewals; if you take the redevelopment out with the Sports Authority assets, it looks like renewals ruled down by about 8%, if I have that right. Is there anything in there -- any tenants or leases that rolled down the most? Anything -- any color you can provide?
John Case: If you look at the last column, released to a tenant after a period of vacancy on Page 24 of our supplement. We had three of those six tenants where we had recapture rate of 54%, where former Ryan's that were leased to national tenants. And even though the rent was substantially less, we substantially increased the value of those investments by leasing them to national high quality tenants, long-term lease terms with good growth. So we got a much lower cap rate, in one instance it was done as a ground lease, and we got a completely new building that would revert to us at the end of the term if this tenant elects to move on. So there is a story behind all of these; if you were to exclude those three former Ryan's, the recapture rate would have been 102% versus the way you calculated it at about 93%, 94%. We still think the right number is 105% and -- including the assets that we released without vacancy. We had an excellent return on our invested capital there and we can get 18% on an unlevered basis for our shareholders, we will do that all day long.
Operator: We'll take the final question today from Collin Mings with Raymond James.
Collin Mings: Thanks, yes, good afternoon. Just sticking with that Page 24, just -- can you expand just on the types of opportunities you're seeing as far as redevelopment, obviously this quarter was a bit unusual in terms of Sports Authority but is there a way to think about how much you could or would spend, given some of the incremental yield opportunities?
Sumit Roy: Yes, so one of the things that we've been talking about now for quite a while is our focus on asset management and we've had a very focused effort in trying to identify opportunities, not only when it comes to releasing assets but even with existing assets, out parcel developments; do my seeing existing assets, having direct conversations with tenants to figure out if they need is for the 100% of the assets or it could be better served in by taking back some of the asset and re-tenanting it. All those discussions have sort of started to finally bear fruition and that's sort of the reason why you're starting to see 105%, 106%, 110% returns. We current are looking at 31 different opportunities within our portfolio and these are just immediate opportunities which should play out over the next twelve-months. And some of the returns that John just mentioned is around the zip codes of what we are expecting on some of these opportunities and this is going to continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of our business and one of the growth drivers that we are very excited about.
Collin Mings: Okay. And then just -- maybe can you quantify that just in terms of dollars and how do you balance that opportunity versus some of the messaging as far as wind or rash it up some disposition activity as well?
Sumit Roy: I mean disposition is different, in my mind from our asset management opportunities -- pure asset management that I was referencing, part of the reason why we've increased our disposition is to take advantage of the market that we have today by another $25 million. Quantifying this asset management, it continues to change; you continue to find new opportunities. So I think I'd be premature in putting a dollar amount to it but I can certainly share with you that the returns that we're looking at are in the high teens.
John Case: And I'll add to that, that we expect as Sumit said to become an increasing component of our business as we more actively manage the portfolio and just to remind you the dispositions are almost exclusively non-strategic assets; they are being sold-off our list which remains right at about 1%. So it's a kind of two different concepts there.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.
John Case: Thanks Matt, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again, and I'm sure we'll see most, if not all of you at May REIT. So have a good afternoon and thanks for being on our call.
Operator: And again, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.

Operator: Please stand by, we’re about to begin. Good day, everyone and welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Janeen Bedard: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income’s Second Quarter 2016 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be: John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company’s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit the during the Q&A portion of the call; in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you have an additional question please rejoin the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.
John Case: Thanks, Janeen, and welcome to our call today. We’re pleased to report another active quarter for acquisitions and healthy AFFO per share growth of 4.4% to $0.71. As announced in yesterday’s Press Release we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance from $900 million to approximately $1.25 billion and reiterating our AFFO per share guidance for 2016 of $2.85 to $2.90.
0:01:57.4 : Our balance sheet is now in the best shape in our company’s history. Based on the ongoing confidence we have in our business and our financial strength, we’ve elected to provide our shareholders with an additional 1% increase in the monthly dividend payable in September which represents a 6.1% increase over September of 2015. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks, John. I will provide a few highlights for some items in our financial statements for the quarter. Starting with the income statement; other revenue in this quarter was a negative amount negative 129,000. This was a result of a reclassification of some revenue from other revenue that was book in Q1 to rental revenue that it is reflected here in Q2. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 5.4% this quarter, due to higher stock compensation cost for our Board of Directors in the quarter. The stock grant occurred in May and our higher stock prices in spring caused this expense to be a little higher. Year-to-date SG&A is only 5.1% of revenues and we’re still projecting approximately 5% for the year. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 1.4% and we’re still projecting approximately 1.5% for the year. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we’ve continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. We’ve raised $487 million of common equity capital thus far this year our $2 billion credit facility which has a $1 billion expansion option has a balance of approximately $530 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $22.6 million of our mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remained in very good shape, with only $5 million in mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due during the second half of 2016. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. Finally, our overall leverage remains low with our debt-to-EBITDA ratio standing at approximately 5.1 times. So in summary we have low leverage, excellent liquidity and good excess to both equity and debt capital, both which are well priced financial alternatives for us right now. Let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background.
John Case: Thanks, Paul. I’ll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98%, a 20 basis points increase from last quarter. Economic occupancy was 98.9% also up from last quarter. We continue to make good progress with our re-leasing and sales efforts and expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. From the 37 properties we re-leased during the quarter we recaptured 92% of the expiring rent. As it’s typical for us we had no spending on tenant improvements in connection with our re-leasing. Year-to-date we have recaptured a 103% of expiring rent on 75 lease rollovers which remains well above our long term average. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,100 properties with expiring leases, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to our net-lease, our peer companies who also report this metric. Our same store rent increased 1.4% during the quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. We continue to expect annual same store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. Approximately 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases. We remain pleased with the growth we were able to achieve from our properties, without having to incur any significant recurring maintenance capital expenditures to generate this growth. Approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we have never had a year with negative same store rent growth. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contribute to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 246 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the second quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.6% of rental revenues and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenue. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in the second half of this year by Walgreens pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents 2% of our annualized rental revenue. The store level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties remains 2.7 times on a four wall basis and the median remained 2.6 times. Moving on to acquisitions, we completed $310 million in acquisitions during the quarter and for the first half of the year, we completed $663 million in acquisitions, at record high investment spreads related to our weighted average cost of capital. We continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. For the first half of the year, we sourced approximately $15 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy acquiring under 5% of the amount sourced year-to-date, which is consistent with our average since 2010. As I mentioned, we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance to approximately $1.25 billion and continue to acquire the highest quality net leased properties as we grow our portfolio. I’ll hand it over to Sumit Roy, to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions activities.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John. During the second quarter of 2016, we invested $310 million in 57 properties, located in 22 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.5 years. On a revenue basis, 58% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 68% of the revenues are generated from retail and 32% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 14 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our transportation services, motor vehicle dealerships and discount grocery stores. We closed 22 independent transactions in the second quarter and the average investment per property was approximately $5.4 million. Year-to-date 2016 we invested $663 million in a 154 properties located in 34 states, at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. On a revenue basis, 39% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 78% of the revenues are generated from retail and 22% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 23 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our casual dining restaurants, transportation services and motor vehicle dealerships. Of the 41 independent transactions closed year-to-date one transactions was about $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $8 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date we have sourced approximately $15 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 60% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $6 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 64% for the second quarter. Of the $300 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 65% were one-off transactions. After pricing, cap rates remained flat in the second quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 15 properties for net proceeds of $24 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.5% and realized an unlevered IRR of 10.5%. This brings us to 26 properties sold year-to-date for $35 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.4%, unrealized an unlevered IRR of 9.3%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 252 basis points in the second quarter, which were well above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. So in conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisitions guidance for 2016 to approximately $1.25 billion and we remain confident in reaching our 2016 disposition target of between $50 million and $75 million. With that, I’d like to hand it back to John.
John Case: Thank you, Sumit. As I mentioned, we have successfully issued approximately $0.5 billion in common equity year-to-date. Approximately $55 million of the equity raised was executed opportunistically through our ATM program during the final week of June and reflect at the lowest cost of equity raised in our company’s history. Today, our investment spreads related to our nominal cost of equity are well in excess of our historical investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital, which allows us to drive earnings growth as well as further strengthen our balance sheet. Our leverage continues to be at historical lows with debt to total market cap of approximately 21% and debt-to-EBITDA of 5.1 times. Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.5 billion of capacity available on our $2 billion revolving line of credit, providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. We are pleased that our sector leading credit strength was recognized in the second quarter by Moody’s and S&P, both of which upgraded us giving positive outlook while reaffirming our BAA1 and BBB+ credit ratings. Yesterday we announced our 87th dividend increase payable in September which represents a 6.1% increase over the dividend in September of 2015. We’ve increased our dividend every year since the company’s listing in 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our current AFFO payout ratio at the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance is 83.5%, which is a level we are quite comfortable with. To wrap it up, we had another good quarter and remain optimistic about our future. As demonstrated by our sector leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%. We continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in our net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisitions environment remains a very efficient marketplace and we believe we are best positioned to capitalize on the highest quality opportunities given our sector leading cost-to-capital and balance sheet flexibility. At this time, I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we’ll first hear from Josh Dennerlein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Joshua Dennerlein: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I’m curious know why the initial yields and this cap rates on Q2 investments came in at 6.3% looks it goes down from 6.6% in 1Q. Did that have to do with just asset mix that you purchased or was that a broader move in cap rates across the board?
John Case: That was really a function of the assets repurchase. In first quarter, our average cap rates was 6.5% and we round it down to 6.3% for the second quarter. So it’s really a reflection of the high quality properties which would include great real estate locations good investment structures as well as the quality of the tenant and the industry; and we also had a fairly high percentage for the quarter of investment grade tenants during just under 60%, which is higher than we typically see and that also help to drive the pricing in that. But for the year, we’re still guiding to somewhere right around 6.5%, Josh.
Joshua Dennerlein: Thanks, I appreciate that. So it sounds like you really haven’t seen any moving cap rates from my perspective we’ve just - we’ve seen the 10 year drop pretty substantially post breaks it both. So we weren’t sure if it was translating into any moves across asset types.
John Case: We’ve not seen any movements in cap rates in our sector. We kind a look at it is investment grade and non-investment grade. And on the investment grade side we’re still seen a cap rate range by anywhere from the low-fives up into the high sixes on the initial yield. And on the non-investment grade product we’re seeing anything from an initial yield high-five’s up to around just north of 8% and that’s exactly where it was a quarter ago. So we haven’t seen and react to due to the change in capital cost that’s resulted in all time high on spreads that we’re experiencing right now.
Operator: Next we’ll hear from Rob Stevenson of Janney.
Robert Stevenson: Good afternoon, guys. John, can you talk a little bit about the magnitude of the sale leaseback transactions that are in the market. I assume in your billions of dollars of deals that you’ve look at, if you look at a few of those. I mean how robust is that today? Are some of the tenants pulling back on that or you seeing an acceleration of those type of deals whether or not you guys are doing them or just to even looking at them?
John Case: Yeah, I mean, we are seeing a nice glow of sale leaseback opportunities. When you look at what we have done to date and seen, it is running near 40%. So, there is a great deal of activity out there. Overall, in terms of sourced opportunities year-to-date, we are in the proximally $15 billion, that is a good number. We can continue to see good transaction flow. And some of that flow is sale leaseback opportunities, large ones with single tenants which are well positioned to do. We we’ll see whether they happen or not. So, we are still seeing good investment opportunities.
Robert Stevenson: And given your tenants concentration, I mean, what is your tolerance these days size wise for any of these transactions? I mean, anything that would wind-up elevating somebody in your top five or seven tenants?
John Case: Well, I’ll say this, in terms of tenants, we like to see them in the mid to high single-digits. You want to maintain our diversification and we want it to be the right tenant in terms of industry. We want to see industries in the low double-digits. Now, we may have period of time where we go above those levels for tenants and industries, but we will manage back down to be diversified. So, 5% of ramp represents a transaction of about $750 million. So, that will kind of give you an idea, I think that covers it.
Operator: Next we’ll hear from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra: Thank you. I guess, I’m just trying to think, just take a picture of you guys in some of your peers I know it’s a fairly unique situation from cost to capital standpoint. Just tactically and strategically, can you walk us through how you’re thinking about using this cost to capital, whether you referenced quality assets a couple of times, but are there other sectors you can look at, sorry, sub sectors, the type of property size, and then maybe you just overlay how you think about near term accretion versus long-term?
John Case: Yeah, we only get to your first one on our cost-to-capital advantage. Real estate discipline and investment wide what’s within our investment parameters? We’ve been asked this question fairly frequently and we are not going to go out and do transactions that we are not comfortable with, just to drive accretion of earnings growth where we think the long-term returns are not going to meet our hurdle rate due to the quality of the investment. So, we are fortunate and that we are seeing plenty of opportunities that need our investment criteria and with our spreads in our distinct cost to capital advantage we are able to drive growth. So when we underwrite properties, we are really we are focusing the IRR and it doesn’t mean a hurdle rate over the long term and we are also looking at what sort of accretion does it produce today, and usually that’s the easiest hurdle. And then the challenging aspect to the underwriting process is getting something that you know and you feel confident about this going to perform over 20 year or 15 year lease term and the percentage I believe, you are going to be have good recapture on that. So that’s how we look at it.
Vikram Malhotra: But just in terms of balance sheet, I mean, you could potentially take level down even further there are new asset classes you could think about. I’m just wondering, or is it just it sound like the spread is this an all-time high or have you seen the spreads at other points as well?
John Case: Well, as we sit here today this is an all-time high. We’ve reached the levels close to this, I’ll saying since 2011 we’ve been at spreads and we’re substantially higher than our long term average investment spread over our nominal first year weighted average cost to capital. Over the history of a company that they averaged about 145 basis points over the last five years we’ve been more or like 180 basis points to 255 basis points and today they are close to 300 basis points based on our share price. So, the spreads are substantial but we are going to remain disciplined. We could acquire virtually everything we see given our constant capital advantage. But lot of what we see is property, not within our investment perimeter, they’re not let me want to own. As far as the balance sheet goes we’ve remained conservative, we only have we believed in a conservative balance sheet and it has enabled us to write out some difficult recessions over the last 20 years. Most recently the great recession where we were one of the few companies that continue to raise the dividend and that we have to reacquire. So, we are going to committed to maintaining a conservative balance sheet.
Operator: Next we’ll here from Dan Donlan of Ladenburg Thalmann.
Daniel Donlan: Thank you and good afternoon. I actually have three questions I hope I can get through them very quick. The first question was on the overall recapture rate it was slightly under 92%, I think that’s when it’s comp lowered versus where it has been historically I mean it was kind of all driven by the asset that had a period of vacancy. I know, we are talking our very diminish amount of rent. But we are just of curious if you could kind of give us a little detail and what happened with those five assets is this kind of and if there is anything we can read into that?
John Case: Dan, it really comes down to three assets. The 92% releasing spread this quarter as you said it was minimum, was about 3 basis points and lost rent are driven by just these three assets. One was a key seasonable assets it was really leased as a ground leased a best in class QSR quick service restaurant, who then improve the building and ended up dramatically enhancing the real estate value. But we went from leasing land and a building to just leasing land.  So, we had a big you would have to [indiscernible] that will down now there. There were two other assets [indiscernible] concept that accounting for the remaining negative impact on releasing spread action on these three assets the 34 remaining assets would have had a rent recapture rate of 106%. And then of course year-to-date our rent recapture rate is 103%. So until that this is a really a non-issue and certainly not to be any some sort of trend. 
Daniel Donlan: Okay. And then just had a curiosity, looking at page #25, do you have any way to quality kind of what the recapture rate is or what the retention rate is or your subsequent explorations versus your initial explorations. Is one better than the other and I wanted to follow-up on that too as well.
Paul Meurer: Yeah, Dan, it’s Paul I can speak to that a little bit. You may recall some years ago we split out initial explorations versus subsequent to indicate that the subsequent explorations do a lot better because that really is a tenant who’s already made the choice at the end of an initial 15 or 20 year term to clearly stay in that state at that property with us. And as such, there is a slightly higher likelihood that five years later they’re going to make the same decision in stay at that site. So, that was a reason we have broken this out initially. We don’t have any projections that we put on that other than to share with you that when you look into these years and you see that portion of subsequent explorations growing, that should give you some level of comfort relative to the fact that we think we’re going to do quite well with those tenants and probably going to stay at the site have a rental bumps associated with that, et cetera. But that’s why we broke it out a few years back.
Operator: Our next question will come from Tyler Grant of Green Street Advisors.
Tyler Grant: Hello guys. Just two questions from me today to start it off, if you could only invest in one property type which one would it be? So retail, office or industrial, and then on that same note why is 80% of revenue is the right allocation to retail for you guys?
John Case: Yeah, well we don’t invest actively in office, in the office that we do has come through portfolio transactions and a couple of relationships we have with major retail tenants who’ve asked us to look at on the leaseback on that headquarters. So we’re not out there actively pursuing that. As far as the difference between retail and industrial if they fit on investment parameters, we don’t have a bias and we’re not trying to target 80% retail. It’s more a function on the opportunities we see in the marketplace. So we’re seeing more retail opportunities within our investment parameters then we are industrial opportunities. But this past quarter industrial picked up a little bit, but given the market and the opportunities available, we’re going to be a predominantly retail net-lease company and whether that number is 80%, 79%, 75% 82%. We can’t tell you because that’s going to be driven by the opportunities we see in the marketplace, beyond [ph] what we are looking for.
Tyler Grant: Okay, and then just moving onto the next question. You guys currently have about 2.5% of your revenues that come from AMC the Movie theater operator. Do you think that or how do you think that consolidation within the movie theater category could potentially impact your portfolio and the related cap rates on those assets.
John Case: Yeah, I think we’ve been following this closely both their current live discussions as well as their earlier discussions over in Europe. we think consolidation by enlarge is a good thing, IMCE theaters have been performing very well for us, it’s been a very good two years in the theater industry. And we’re seeing good growth there, but we think the efficiencies the size the liquidity didn’t come with this if properly structured and profitably financed certainly would be a positive.
Operator: Our next question will come from Nick Joseph of Citi.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. What percentage of tenants give you regular updates on their financial performance?
John Case: Our retail tenants, it's about 70%.
Nicholas Joseph: And those [ph] who are on annual basis?
John Case: Yeah, I mean in some are quarterly, some are semi-annually, some are annually.
Nicholas Joseph: Okay. And so how much of your tenant sales grown over the last year?
John Case: Our --from the tenant sales growth, I don't think I have got the aggregate number of what their sales growth has been. But our EBIT - our rent coverage ratio, our EBITDAR, not sales, but our EBITDAR ratio is as I mentioned in my remarks 2.7 times on an average. And then the median is 2.6 times, and that's [ph] pre-G&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Next we'll hear from Todd Stender of Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: Paul, just to get into the balance sheet, you've got a bond maturing in September. Just want to get a sense of timing when you’re going to meet that debt maturity. I guess, when can you pay that off, and is it fair to assume maybe a way to tuck in the line of credit balance at that time?
Paul Meurer: It matures in mid-September. And Todd, when we get there we'll look at the alternatives we have for refinancing it, whether it be any of the markets we finance in or temporarily putting that on the line. We just have to look at the markets at the time. So it's hard to answer that several months in advance.
Todd Stender: Okay. And then when I just look at some of the other coupons and size of the bonds coming due in the next couple of years, when you look at a large balance and a relatively high coupon like 2019. When can you economically make the numbers work to pull something like that forward, make a tender offer or try to retire that.
John Case: We’ve looked a lot at this. And Paul, I think, is the right person to address that.
Paul Meurer: Yes. And you can imagine Todd, we look at that on a regular basis and kind of have models that we update frequently. That's pretty far out. So you can imagine these make whole provisions that are typically 25 basis point, sometimes 20 basis points built in to most of the bonds that are in the REIT market are there for a reason, they protect the bond investor relative to that yield, and they are pretty owners to overcome. So when you talk about multiple years out it becomes a little bit more challenging in terms of when that will make sense. I think that it will be closer become a little easier, and that's something we do a lot of work on to look at things when they are within more or less 18 to 24 month timeframe and shorter. But out to [ph] 2019, it becomes very difficult.
Operator: Our next question comes from Collin Mings of Raymond James.
Collin Mings: Hey, good afternoon, guys.
John Case: Hey Collin.
Collin Mings: Just continuing with the balance sheet, just can you touch on how you’re thinking about preferred equity as part of the capital structure. I think you have about $400 million that’s callable in 2017?
John Case: Yes. We have $410 million callable in February of '17. Again, we look at the market and we will consider what the most appropriate refinancing it would be, what type of capital would be, whether it's more preferred debt, equity, something else. We’ll look at all of opportunities. So we’re certainly aware of that and aware that the pricing on that is well above where we could do preferred today.
Collin Mings: Right. Just as you sit here today, any bias one way or the other just as we think about modeling that. If you think it's safe to think that you would want to keep preferreds as part of the capital structure, although be it at a lower rate, or just given where your debt costs are, that would be maybe the either way you go.
John Case: No. I don’t think we really have a bias today
Paul Meurer: No. I think it would be reasonable to model something that is a lower rate if you will, relatively to where that coupon on that preferred currently is. But what type of security is difficult to say. And the one thing, I would point out is relative to FFO projection to the extent that the preferred is called which we haven’t decided that we’re even going to do that, that would obviously impact FFO for next year as well.
Operator: And we’ll take a follow up from Dan Donlan of Ladenburg Thalmann.
Daniel Donlan: Thank you for taking the follow up. Just going back to my question on the subsequent versus initial. I was looking back at your prior expirations and it looks like the subsequent were typically about half of what expired in a given year. And as I look out to 18, 19, 2021, 2022, the bulk of your initial expirations are initial expirations. And I realize that some of these subsequent expirations will re-lease that every five years, but it still looks like the lion's share is going to be close to initial. So the question is, do you think that impacts your recapture rate on a going forward basis, or how are you looking at that? I realize that it's three, four, five years down the line, but it's just
John Case: Sumit, you want to take that?
Sumit Roy: Yes. Sure, John. So we’ve been talking about this for quite a few quarters now Dan, with every year that goes by our maturity schedules going to come down. And what we haven’t seen is a distinct differential that we can point to as a trend that says on second generation re-leasing we get substantially better re-leasing spread positive re-leasing versus [ph] first generation re-leasing. I think Paul sort of addressed some of it that, yes, what we’ve seen is, if people have exercised an option they will tend to stay there. and most of these options have built in gains or renewal bumps in rent, which could range anywhere between 3% to 5%, and sometimes it’s higher 10%. So it’s a very difficult for us to tell you that hey, the second, third generation assets that are going to be coming due, what is going to be the trend on the renewals on that front. So that’s, that’s - and it’s a fact that with every year, our average renewal rates are going to come down, our re-leasing rates going to come down.
Daniel Donlan: Okay. And as far as the weighted average lease term does, it’s at 9.8 years. I mean, is that something given the large numbers in the math, that’s it’s going to be hard to get that back above 10 again unless there's some serious M&A, or is that something you guys think about or is it just as long as you're getting good re-leasing spreads, you're fine with a shorter wall?
John Case: Well, we’re certainly pleased with the re-leasing spreads. And it’s just a math, we’ve got a $20 billion plus portfolio of properties, where each year the lease term get shorter by a year, and you're requiring $1.25 billion in 15 years, 16 years. A mature net lease company like ourselves, will have an average lease term that was down unless there is something exceptional that occurs. So we thought about this. This has been happening for a long time now. And we had built out our portfolio management group, which is the largest group within the company, and they've executed more than 2,100 lease rollovers, and we're quite experienced at that. So as the frequency will pick up in future years, we've got a great team in place, and we'll continue to grow that team with the proper talent. Many peers out there with longer lease terms don't even have that department. So here, I'd say one of our most important departments and certainly our largest department. So we've been focused on this for a while, but it's just, as we all say, it's simple math.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Lucas of Capital One Securities.
Chris Lucas: Hi, good afternoon. Like I see guys, it’s still in the morning. But Just 2 sort of general big picture questions. John, on the acquisitions front, have you seen any change to the competitive landscape that you guys are in as it relates to sources of capital for financing these kinds of transactions?
John Case: No, we really haven't. It's the same group of people that we always see. Some other public REITs every now and then, some non-listed REITs, you see the mortgage REITs. There are some private equity funds out there that invest in this sector. And then, there's the institutional capital, that’s run by experienced net lease investment managers. That could be [ph] endowment of pension fund and even sovereign wealth fund money. And they kind of change the higher-quality, higher-rated opportunities. And that hasn't changed. There hasn't been a new group of entrants in terms of competition.
Chris Lucas: Okay, great. And then just listening to you talk about some of the capital market situations that you are facing, whether it's the bond or the preferreds, I guess, I'm just wondering, what's sort of your view on interest rates over the sort of next 6 to 12 months?
John Case: Wow. One thing I've learned is I'm not very good at predicting interest rates in the future. And I haven't really met many people who are. But as we look at our own business, we want to position it for any interest rate environment. So whether they tick up, whether they continue to stay down or whether they go back down a bit, we want to have a strong balance sheet and a business model that performs well in all of those situations. Personally, there is just so much thirst for yield globally. It's hard for me to see the 10 year moving significantly, even if the Fed does raise Fed funds later this year. I'm not so sure that the influence in the 10 year is not far greater based on what's happening globally and the fund flows that are coming into the U.S. treasury market.
Operator: Next, we'll have a follow-up from Tyler Grant of Green Street Advisors.
Tyler Grant: Hi again, guys. So earlier in the call, it was mentioned that you've never had a year of negative same-store revenue growth. However, if I look at your definition, I believe that it does not include assets that became vacant during the measurement period. So if I were to look at it historically, on average, if you did include assets that went vacant during the period, how much lower would the metric be?
Paul Meurer: Tyler, it's Paul. We've done our homework on this topic, because it has come up a few times from you. The answer on average will be about 20 basis points. So when there's a year, where we say 1.3%. If you calculated the way that you calculated relative to vacant properties, it would be about 1.1%. That's our average.
Tyler Grant: Okay. That makes sense. And then just to follow up on Dan Donlan's questions regarding just leasing stats. As your portfolio gets older and your lease terms start to shrink, I would imagine in any given year that it's naturally going to mean that you have more lease expires. Is this fair to assume that as your portfolio continues to mature as a result of the more lease expiries that your same-store growth is also going to slow as well?
John Case: No it all - Not necessarily. It all - I mean, it all depends on where we're able to draw those re-leasing opportunities and what's happening with market rents and where are the rents on the properties rolling relative to those market rents and our retention rate. So I wouldn’t say it's safe to assume that, that's going to decrease.
Operator: And we'll take a follow-up from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley.
Landon Park: This is Landon on for Vikram. Just had a question about the deals that you have sourced so far this year. Can you give us a split between Self-sourced and ones that you've sourced through marketed deals?
John Case: Yes. I mean, we're - that's not something that we typically track. I'd say we're getting to sort of the relationship side of the business of what we close. We typically close 80% transactions based on direct relationships we have that we do. That's sort of our long-term average. So I don't know if that answers your question.
Landon Park: Has there been a shift one way or the other in that trend? Or it's been very consistent?
John Case: It's been pretty consistent. If anything, it's grown a little bit more towards relationship-oriented transactions and sale-leaseback opportunities.
Operator: And this concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income’s conference call. I would now like to turn the conference back over to John Case for any additional and closing comments.
John Case: Thanks, April, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. I'm sure we'll be speaking with you in the near-term future, and enjoy the rest of your summer.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Please stand by, we’re about to begin. Good day and welcome to the Realty Income First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead.
Janeen Bedard: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income’s first quarter 2016 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be: John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company’s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit the during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.
John Case: Thanks, Janeen, and welcome to our call today. And we’re pleased to begin the year with an active quarter for acquisitions and healthy AFFO per share growth of 4.5% to $0.70. As announced in yesterday’s press release we are increasing our 2016 acquisitions guidance from $750 million to approximately $900 million and reiterating our AFFO per share guidance for 2016 of $2.85 to $2.90 as we anticipate another solid year of earnings and dividend growth. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks, John. I’m going to provide highlights for a few items in our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Interest expense increased in the quarter by $2.2 million to $60.7 million. This increase was due to the recognition of a non-cash loss of approximately $5.8 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter. As a reminder, theses mark-to-market adjustments on our floating to fixed interest rate swaps will tend to cause volatility in our reported interest expense and FFO on a quarterly basis, particularly when there is significant movement in short-term forward curve rates as we saw in the first quarter. Naturally, this evaluation will fluctuate based on the outlook for interest rates. Last quarter, it resulted in a $4.1 million non-cash gain. We do adjust for these non-cash gains or losses when computing our cash AFFO earnings. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by less overall debt in our balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of bonds and over $300 million in mortgages over the last 12 months. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong and continue to tick higher with interest coverage of 4.6 times and fixed charge coverage of 4.1 times. Our fixed charge coverage is the highest it has been in well over 10 years. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was less than 4.8%, which continues to be the lowest percentage in the net-lease sector. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was 2.3%. As a percentage of revenues, these expenses came in slightly higher than normal due to temporarily higher carry costs on some vacant properties and some timing issues on tenant reimbursements which will be received in the second quarter. We continue to estimate our run-rate for property expenses in 2016 to be approximately 1.5% of revenues. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain our conservative capital structure. Last year, we established an ATM or At-the-Market equity distribution program. In the first quarter we utilized this program to issue 500,000 shares, generating net proceeds of approximately $31 million. Our $2 billion credit facility has a balance of approximately $650 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $22.8 million in mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape, with only $22 million in mortgages and $275 million of bonds coming due in 2016. And our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. And finally, our debt to EBITDA ratio stands at approximately 5.3 times, and is only 5.8 times inclusive of preferred equity. Now, let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on these results.
John Case: Thanks, Paul. I’ll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 97.8%. Occupancy declined a bit due to a number of leases expiring during the quarter, including leases rejected through the Buffets Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in March. We are working through this additional vacancy with our re-leasing and sales efforts and continue to expect to end the year at approximately 98% occupancy. Economic occupancy was 98.8%. On the 38 properties we re-leased during the quarter, we recaptured a 112% of the expiring rents, which represents our strongest quarterly recapture rate since we began recording this metric in 2014. As is typical for us, we achieved this without any spending on tenant improvement. Our re-leasing results reflect the high quality of our real estate portfolio, testament to our disciplined investment underwriting and proactive portfolio management efforts. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold more than 2,100 properties with leases expiring, recapturing approximately 98% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. This compares favorably to our net-lease peers who also report this metric. Our same store rent increased 1.3% during the quarter. And we expect annual same store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% for 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, so we remain pleased with the growth we were able to achieve from our properties. Approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we never had a year with negative same store rent growth. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent, property type, all of which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At the end of the quarter, our properties were leased to 243 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the first quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant accounting for 6.8% of rental revenues, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenues. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in the second-half of this year by Walgreens pending acquisition of Rite Aid, which represents about 2% of our annualized rental revenue. The store-level performance of our retail tenants also remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties increased to 2.7 times on a four-wall basis and the median remained at 2.6 times for the first quarter. Moving on to acquisitions, during the quarter we completed $353 million in acquisitions, at record spreads through our weighted average cost of capital. And we continue to see a strong flow of opportunities that meet our investment parameters. During the quarter, we sourced $6.2 billion in acquisition opportunities, putting us on pace for another active year in acquisition. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy acquiring just 6% of the amount we sourced, which is consistent with our average since 2010. As a remainder, our revised acquisitions guidance of approximately $900 million principally reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any unidentified large-scale transaction. I’ll hand it over to Sumit, to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John. During the first quarter of 2016, we invested $353 million in 103 properties, located in 31 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.8 years. On a revenue basis, 23% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail and 14% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 26 different tenants in 18 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our restaurants and motor vehicle dealerships. We closed 19 independent transactions in the first quarter and the average investment per property was approximately $3.4 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $6 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 48% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 52% or more than $3 billion were one-off assets. Investment-grade opportunities represented 30% for the first quarter. Of the $353 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter 37% were one-off transactions. We continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 47 year operating history. As to pricing cap rates remained flat in the first quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold 11 properties for net proceeds of $11 million at a cash cap rate of 6.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 6.6%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 255 basis points in the first quarter which were well above our historical average spreads. We defined investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year WACC. In conclusion, as John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2016 to approximately $900 million. We remain confident in reaching our 2016 disposition target of between $50 million and $75 million. With that, I’d like to hand it back to John.
John Case: Thanks, Sumit. Following the very active year we had in the capital markets in 2015 we raised $35 million in common equity during the first quarter. Approximately $31 million of the equity raise during the quarter was through our ATM program. Our leverage continues to be at historical lows with debt to market cap of approximately 24%, debt to EBITDA of 5.3 times and a debt service coverage ratio of 4.6 times. We currently have more than $1.3 billion of capacity on our $2 billion revolving line of credit providing us with excellent liquidity as we grow our company. Our sector-leading cost to capital and balance sheet flexibility allows us to drive earnings per share and dividend growth while remaining disciplined with our investment and underwriting strategy. Last month, we announced our 85th dividend increase, representing a 5% increase from this time last year. We have increased our dividend every year since the company’s listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our current AFFO payout ratio at the midpoint of our 2016 AFFO per share guidance is 83%, a level we are quite comfortable with. To wrap it up, we had a solid quarter and remain optimistic for 2016. As demonstrated by our sector-leading EBITDA margins of approximately 94%, we continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size and the economies of scale in our net lease business. Our portfolio is performing well and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. The net lease acquisitions environment remains a very efficient marketplace and we believe we were best-positioned to capitalize on the highest quality opportunities given our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and distinct cost of capital advantage. At this time, I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go first to Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good morning on the West Coast. Just hoping you could speak a little bit to the watch-list you may have, and in particular, any potential vacancies if some of the tenants like Sports Authority or Friendly’s, if all their stores went dark, what would be the delta in occupancy under that sort of bear case scenario?
John Case: Sure, I can address the watch-list then touch on vacancies. The watch-list is now at 0.8%. Juan, as you remember, we have a credit watch-list that’s 5.8%. And then, we have an overall watch-list and that overall watch-list incorporates everything, including the quality of the real estate location, industry trends, concentrations we may have, not just credit. So those are the size of the two watch-lists at this point. With regard to - when we look at the material exposures that we have, we feel like we are in very good shape. With regard to Sports Authority, which we typically do not talk about tenants outside of our top-20, they been in our top-20 before and obviously they’re in the news, so we didn’t want to address that today. Sports Authority, we have minimal exposure to, well under 1% of grant. The stores that we have are receiving significant interest from a number of national retailers, some sporting goods stores, but also retailers outside of that sector. Our cash flows on those stores, our capital coverages are quite strong. And I think this morning, as you probably saw they announced that they were going to pursue liquidation. Our guidance has incorporated our expectations with regard to Sports Authority and any other credit issues into it. So that’s why we’re sticking with - on the AFFO per share $2.85 to $2.90. So we think we’re going to end up the year at occupancy of approximately 98%. We’re at 97.8% today. And obviously we started the year off at 98.4%. The biggest hit was in the first quarter, late in the first quarter when we received the Ovation Brands’ or Buffets’ properties back. And that was the sole reason or principally the sole reason for the downtick in occupancy. And they came in late in the quarter, so we didn’t have a lot of opportunity to work those properties in terms of re-leasing and sales.
Juan Sanabria: Great. And just one follow-up question, separate topic, could you give us a sense of what percentage of restaurants where you kind of call them out in terms of the first quarter deal volume. And I know you guys had previously been a little bit bearish in your discourse about casual dining. What in particular around the brands you may have acquired was appealing to you? And if you could, maybe talk to some of the valuation numbers around that.
John Case: Yes, I mean, I’ll address casual dining. We invested in QSR restaurants as well as casual dining restaurants in the first quarter. We are consistent with what we said regarding casual dining. We’ve not made many investments in casual dining restaurants here over the last five years, just a few and none that have been material. But when we do look at casual dining restaurants, we have a very high underwriting hurdle rate. So we want coverages well north of 3 times, 4 times we can get it. We want footprints that are smaller, 6,000 square feet in that area that is fungible and we want rents that approximate market and we want to be invested at replacement cost or near-replacement cost. And we want to be invested in a concept that’s stable or improving. And most of what we’ve seen over the last five years has not met that hurdle. But when it does we meet those hurdles. We are comfortable buying casual dining restaurants.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Rob Stevenson with Janney.
Robert Stevenson: Good afternoon, guys. Can you talk a little bit about in terms of the acquisitions you made during the quarter? Was it a certain asset, certain group of asset, certain type of tenant or whatever, that sort of pushed the cap rate down into the 6% range?
John Case: Yes, the - no, it wasn’t really anything other than having to do with the quality of the assets. As you know, last year our average cap rate was 6.6% for the quarter. It was 6.6% here for the first quarter in 2016. And the cap rate is reflective of the quality of the assets. And it’s as simple as that. It wasn’t one type of asset that really drove it.
Robert Stevenson: Okay. And then, in terms of the way we should be thinking about the sort of hundred or so leases you have expiring throughout the year, I mean, what’s your expectations at this point for a conversion ratio in terms of renewing those leases versus ones that are likely to go vacant at least temporarily?
John Case: Yes. I mean, again, we think we are going to - the easiest way to answer this question is we think we’re going to end up at approximately 98% of occupancy. So this is relatively for us a light year from here on out with regard to lease rollover. So we would expect to - our historical rate has been to re-let about 70% for the same tenant, 20% to new tenants and sell about 10%. Whether we match that or not this year, I am not sure. But, again, we feel good about the prospects on those properties that we have that expire during the remaining three quarters of the year.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra: Thank you. Just on the acquisitions trajectory, you guys had a very nice quarter, the first quarter. But just looking at the guidance, most of the raise is a just flow-through from sort of what you’ve done in the first quarter. And you typically don’t see a sort of slowdown in the trajectory. Generally, second or third quarter seems to be - you seemed to have a quarter in the past. I’m just kind of wondering what - is there something different, is there something got a push-back and is this more kind of maybe the first quarter strong and then the fourth quarter strong as well.
John Case: Well, our quarterly acquisitions in the recent years have been anywhere from $125 million to $750 million. So they are very difficult to predict. And you’ve heard us use this word, Vikram, a thousand times, but their lumpy. And you can’t take one quarter and extrapolate from that quarter what acquisitions are going to be for the year. So we were really pleased with the first quarter. We think we are going to have a good year. Hence, we raised our acquisitions guidance for the year, $900 million, but there’s no smoothness to being able to project it by quarter upfront.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay, fair enough. And then, can you just update us on how you’re viewing the office - your office and industrial holdings. There has been some more mixed commentary on both sectors. I’m just kind of wondering how you view them as part of the portfolio. And if you can just update us, I believe there is a change in personnel on the industrial side. If you could update us on who is managing that now.
John Case: So let me start with office and then we’ll get into the personnel side of it. First of all, we do not actively seek office on a standalone basis. Office represents 6% of our rental revenue. Office has come into the company really in one of two ways, either through portfolio acquisitions, where 85%, 90% are more of the assets where assets that met our investment strategy or through relationships with major tenants where we had - for instance, a major retail tenant come to us and ask us to do a, say, leaseback on their office headquarters. So if we’re comfortable with the structure and the investment, we would do that for relationship purposes. So we don’t intend to grow the office exposure. Industrial right now is about 13%. And we have a high, again, hurdle rate for industrial. We’re looking for Fortune 1000 tenants, fungible buildings and significant or mission-critical building markets leased to investment-grade tenants. So on the industrial-front, this change happened quite a while ago. But Ben Fox and Greg Libby now are the two people who head up our industrial effort. And they’ve been doing that now for probably close to a year now.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. I’m wondering if you can talk about the strength of the 1031 market and what you’re seeing there, and then just pricing overall with larger portfolios versus individual assets.
John Case: Sure. The 1031 market has come back and is strong. So we’re seeing good bids in that market or aggressive pricing. I think if you took, for instance, a QSR property and put it in a $200 million portfolio. It probably trades at a cap rate that’s may be 50 to 75 basis points higher than where it would if it were trading on its own, so there is an arb between where one-off assets trade and where larger portfolios trade. The pricing on the portfolios has remained consistent as Sumit really laid out in his opening remarks.
Nicholas Joseph: And how many larger portfolios, I guess, relative to historical averages are out there today to be acquired?
John Case: We’re seeing - there’s really been no drop off in our transaction opportunity flow. We had a very good quarter at $6.2 billion. And we were optimistic about the pipeline and continue to work a number of opportunities on our larger portfolios, some are one-off assets. But no change from our previous trend.
Operator: And we’ll go next to RJ Milligan with Baird.
R.J. Milligan: Hey, guys. John, just on your comments on the casual dining sector, curious if you looked at the Bloomin [ph] portfolio, I think given your comments, maybe you looked at it, but didn’t spend much time looking at it.
John Case: Yeah. We don’t comment on specific transactions. I’ve laid out the conditions under which we would invest in a casual dining portfolio. So I think I’ve answered that.
R.J. Milligan: Okay. And, Sumit, you mentioned that you were seeing some non-investment grades going at the high 5s. I was just curious what kind of properties or industries those assets were trading at pretty low cap rates?
Sumit Roy: Yes. If you look at the QSR sector, if you look at even small franchisees, they are trading in that ZIP code and they are certainly non-investment grade. The other group that we see quite often are C-stores. They are very aggressively priced, some even in the mid-five ZIP code.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Vineet Khanna with Capital One Securities.
Vineet Khanna: Yeah. Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. Can you provide some color on the makeup of that $352 million of first quarter activity? Specifically were there any single large deals in there?
John Case: Sumit?
Sumit Roy: No, if you look at our average per property, we bought about 109 properties. It’s about $3.4 million. So it wasn’t dictated by any one very large asset transactions. We had 19 independent transactions. There were certainly some portfolios we did. 52% of what we did was a leaseback. And I think in my opening remarks I’ve mentioned that 67% of what we did were portfolio deals. That’s really what’s driving the volume.
Vineet Khanna: Okay, sure. And then just looking at a broader sporting goods retailer sector, can you talk about your general sporting goods retailer exposure, and then specifically your Gander Mountain exposure and just the health of that tenant.
Sumit Roy: So we look at the sporting goods industry, if you will, as the story of two worlds really. You got the very good operators in Academy and Dick’s and to some extent Modell’s and then you have the situation that we are seeing playing out in the public press with the Sports Authority. With regards to - and those are the ones that we believe to be very good operators, they continue to do reasonably well despite the fact that they happen to be in a discretionary industry and are competing. But they do have the omni-channel strategy. So they do have their brick and mortars. They do have their Internet strategy as well. And they continue to produce very solid results. With regards to Gander Mountain and what is our exposure there, it is - if I remember correctly, it isn’t very high. And it certainly doesn’t even come close to being in our top 20. So we do have a couple, but it’s insignificant.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Tyler Grant with Green Street Advisors.
Tyler Grant: Guys, how are you doing?
John Case: Good. How are you doing, Tyler?
Tyler Grant: Good, good. Just want to pick your brain today regarding the definition of AFFO. So to start it off, most REITs in the net lease space, when they define AFFO they add back non-cash compensation. I understand the rationale given that AFFO itself is supposed to be a non-cash measure. However, given that the equity compensation represents a significant portion of management’s compensation, do you think that it makes sense to add this back into the AFFO metric?
John Case: Paul?
Paul Meurer: Yes, I mean, Tyler we’re not going to debate how we calculate this metric kind of in this forum. What I will tell you is, what we tried to do is provide great disclosure. And specific to that would be not only that how FFO is calculated in accordance with NAREIT, but then the adjustments that we think are appropriate to arrive at what we think is kind of a cash earnings per share number AFFO-wise. And by laying out that disclosure very clearly we allow analysts to pick and choose in different manners. And certainly through the years many analysts out there have calculated CAD or FAD or AFFO or whatever they want to call it, in their own manner. And so we certainly understand if someone chooses to not include a particular category there, we just laid out what we think is the appropriate measurement of kind of a run rate for us of a cash operating earnings AFFO quarter-to-quarter.
Tyler Grant: All right. Sure. I appreciate the color. Moving on to the next question, regarding cap rates, all else equal, what would you say is the cap rate spread between AA rated assets relative to, let’s say, BBB minus rated assets or tenants?
John Case: The cap rates are really driven more by the quality of the real estate and less by the credit. So it’s very hard to answer that question and isolate it. But you can certainly have high-quality real estate leased to non-investment grade tenants that trade at cap rates that are inside of where real estate leased investment-grade tenants trade. So we don’t really get hang up on whether it’s investment-grade or not. We start with an underwriting of the real estate and does it fall within our investment parameters which we’ve laid out to the market.
Operator: And we’ll go next Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: Hi, guys, thanks. Just to hone in on some of the specific transactions that occurred, just three of them, if we could look at the carrying cap rates and lease terms, maybe get a sense of what the FedEx was acquired for CVSs. And then it looks like you sold some of the NPC assets, which I think are Pizza Huts. Just seeing if you can provide some color on that stuff?
John Case: Sumit?
Sumit Roy: Yes, so the FedEx was a forward that we entered into. And if you look at - obviously you’ve got the blended cap rate of 6.6%. But I’ll tell you, we are looking at FedEx 15-year deals in the market that trading in the mid-5s. So that’s one of the reasons why if you look at what our development cap rate or yield was, it was in that 6.8 ZIP code. It is because a couple of our forwards came into very high quality forward transactions closed. And John has mentioned this in some of the questions that he’s answered that. That is a significant delta between some of these forwards that we had entered into as well as portfolio deals that we had entered into and the one-off market that we’ve seen in today’s environment. So that’s the response in the FedEx. You mentioned that we did sell a couple of NPCs. And you are absolutely right; those are Pizza Hut branded assets. That is something that we are consciously been going through and calling our assets on. I mean, assets that we believe no longer fit our strategic objectives we are trying to call them. And it wasn’t a very big disposition quarter for us, but we expect to get rid of anywhere between $50 million to $75 million of assets through the year.
Todd Stender: And just for pricing for CVSs, looks like you picked up a few.
Sumit Roy: Yes. On some of the CVSs, we actually got them through a small portfolio deal, where we handpicked the assets that we wanted to close on. And we got them at very good cap rates, just given the fact that it was a portfolio deal. Again, if we were to simply go out there and flip out of those. I think there is certainly a fairly healthy spread that we would be able to achieve and those are very well located CVSs.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Karin Ford with MUFG.
Karin Ford: Hi, good afternoon. Just a clarification, you raised investment guidance, but you left AFFO guidance unchanged. And the reason why it was just increasing conservatism on credit issues in the portfolio?
John Case: No, it’s really, Karin, driven by when we anticipate those additional acquisitions coming online. I think they’ll be back-end weighted. So they’ll have more of an impact on 2017’s AFFO per share than they will this year. So given the fact that they’re back-end weighted, the increase did not have a significant increase on what our annualized projected numbers were for this year. It’s just a timing issue.
Karin Ford: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then second question, do you have any update on potential store closures in your portfolio in the Walgreens-Rite Aid merger?
John Case: No, we don’t. We really had very little overlap with regard to properties. We’ve got 15 properties of Rite-Aid properties that are within a 2-mile radius of the Walgreens store. So we expect minimal fallout and overall excited about this merger. The average lease term on these properties is just under 13 years, so even if one were to be closed, obviously, Walgreens would stay on the hook for lease payments that period of time.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Collin Mings with Raymond James.
Collin Mings: Hey, good afternoon. First question for Paul, maybe can you just update us, remind us on how you’re thinking about handling the 2016 debt maturities, just maybe in terms of term and size and just maybe update us on the debt market pricing right now?
Paul Meurer: Sure. So you know the schedule, but basically we have a $275 million bond coming due in mid-September and only about $22 million of mortgages remaining this year in terms of maturities. So $300 million total, call it, on the liability side. Certainly, we’re positioned liquidity-wise to deal with that, even if we did temporarily on the credit line or something of that nature. But so it’s not a big tall order if you will for balance of the year. So we are monitoring the market, we’ve been generally pleased with our equity pricing as well as debt pricing, and debt pricing in particular, I’d say it has improved over the past couple of weeks as that market settled in. Today, we could do a 10-year somewhere around 375 all-in coupon, so that’s very favorable 10-year debt pricing and something we would strongly be considering. But we’ll continue to monitor the market how the stock price does and what the bond market look and feel like over the next handful of months.
Collin Mings: Okay. And I think, Paul, you’ve indicated in previous call that maybe minimum size will be 250 for a debt offering. I mean just how comfortable would you get as far as magnitude as far as size of an offering?
Paul Meurer: I think, we would lean towards something larger to the extent that we could do something larger and provide more liquidity for bond investors today, we think on balance, you may get more favorable pricing in that manner. And by that I mean probably something $500 million area or more. But we’ll think about the appropriate size at that time. 250, I would say historically was more of a minimum to provide that sort of liquidity, but I think the market is asking for more these days. So we would consider something more in the $500-million-plus range.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Rich Moore: Hi, good morning, guys, or good morning out there. Paul, I want to follow-up if I could on that last question. And if you think more broadly about what you guys have, you have $650 million on the line of credit, the 275 bond, another $600 million, let’s say of acquisitions. So you have really more like $1.5 billion to $2 billion of capital needs for the rest of the year and I wish you would stay this way, but I don’t think interest rates always stay low and I don’t think stock prices always stay high. And I’m wondering if there is more of a sense of urgency, even if you have to sort of frontload the balance sheet a little bit with a little bit of cash to do more transactions to clear some of this?
John Case: Hey, Rich, I’ll start and then hand it over to Paul. If you look at the size of the company today, $650 million on the revolver represents about 3% of our capitalization. If you go back to the end of 2012, 30% of our capitalization was $250 million on the line. So given the growth and the size of the company, our relative exposure is no different than really what we’ve done in the past. And the balance sheet, as you know, is in excellent shape and by many measures it’s in the best shape it’s been in 10 years. So we have substantial equity. We did nibble away at the way at the equity through the ATM program in the first quarter that we didn’t want to do anything substantive and dilute our current shareholders and over-equitize the balance sheet. So we’re watching the markets quite closely for permanent funding and debt funding. But we’re quite comfortable here and with our obligations for the remainder of the year. Paul, anything you’d like to add to that?
Paul Meurer: No, the only thing I would add is that we’re very pleased to have a larger line in place. And that provides great liquidity, not only the $2 billion size, but the $1 billion accordion expansion feature on it gives us great comfort relative to our acquisition efforts and needs, and allowing us to be patient and pick our spots on the permanent capital front.
Rich Moore: Okay. All right. Good. Thank you. And then the other question I had for you is you guys had mentioned a while back that you were using obviously this opportunity with your stock price having moved up and if you take a look at bigger transactions like a non-traded REIT or maybe another public company something like that. And I’m wondering if you guys just maybe use a partner to do something little broader even and is that still something you guys are considering or pondering or is that kind of not really on the table?
John Case: Yes, Rich, this is John. You cut out for a second, but I think we got the gist of what you said. Our statement on these sort of questions is that we’re looking at all opportunities in the marketplace, so private and public that make sense for our shareholders. And we’ll continue to do so. So that kind of sums it up. I think I said that on the last call and don’t really think to add anything to that.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, just one follow-up question for me. There’s been some press articles about potential reforms to the 1031 law that allows the tax deferral of gains, maybe limiting that deferral amount or some outright repeals. Any thoughts on kind of what’s going on in Congress, your sense of what may or may not happen there and any potential implications if there is a change to the market?
John Case: We’re not anticipating any changes with regard to the 1031 taxation policies. So at this point, we’re not concerned, Juan. Washington is unpredictable, but getting change through is often pretty difficult and takes a long time.
Juan Sanabria: Thank you.
Paul Meurer: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income’s conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.
John Case: Thanks, Tracey. And we appreciate everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing everyone at the upcoming conferences including NAREIT in early June. Take care.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Realty Income Fourth Quarter 2015 Operating Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead.
Janeen Bedard: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter 2015 operating results conference call. Discussing our results with me, John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, President and Chief Operating Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's form 10-K. We will be observing a two question moments the during the question-and-answer portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. I would now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.
John Case: Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We had a solid fourth quarter which concluded an excellent year for our Company with annualized rental revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. AFFO per share during the fourth quarter increased 4.6% to $0.68, and 2015 AFFO per share increased 6.6% to $2.74. As announced in yesterday's Press Release, we are reiterating our AFFO per share guidance for 2016 of $2.85 to $2.90, as we anticipate another attractive year of earnings growth. Let me hand it over to Paul to provide additional details on our financial results. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks, John. I'm going to provide a few highlights, just a few items in our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Interest expense decreased in quarter by $7.1 million to $52 million. This decrease was driven by less overall debt in our balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of bonds and almost $200 million of mortgages last year. The decrease was also partially due to the inclusion of preferred dividends that were treated as interest expense in the fourth quarter of last year, when we redeemed our series E deferred equity shares in October of 2014. Another larger impact was from the recognition of a noncash gain of approximately $4.1 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter which caused a decrease in that liability and lowered our interest expense.  As a reminder these mark to market adjustments on our floating to fixed interest rate swaps will tend to cause volatility in our reported interest expense and FFO on a quarterly basis, particularly when there is significant movement in short-term forward curve rates as we saw at the end of the fourth quarter. We do adjust for this noncash gain when computing our cash AFFO earnings. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong, with interest coverage at 4.5 times and fixed charge coverage at 4.0 times. Our fixed charge coverage is the highest it has been and will over ten years. Our G&A in 2015 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 5%. We estimate this will remain our approximate run rate for G&A in 2016 as well. Our non reimbursable property expenses in 2015 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was only 1.4%. These expenses came in lower this year due to lower portfolio vacancies, faster releasing of vacant properties, lower property insurance premiums and fewer onetime expenses. We estimate our run rate for property expenses in 2016 to be approximately 1.5%. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain our conservative capital structure. In September we established an ATM or at the market equity distribution program. In Q4, we utilized this program to issue approximately 714,000 shares generating net proceeds of $35.8 million. And in October, we raised $517 million in net proceeds in a common stock offering. We used the proceeds at that time to pay down all outstanding borrowings on our unsecured Revolving Credit Facility. This $2 billion credit facility today has a current balance of $370 million. Other than our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only 170 million in mortgages and 275 million of bonds coming due in 2016. And our maturity schedule was well laddered thereafter. Finally, our debt to EBITDA ratio stands at approximately 5.1 times, and is only 5.5 times inclusive of preferred equity. Now, let me turn the call back over to John to give you more background on these results.
John Case: Thanks, Paul and let me begin with an overview of the portfolio, which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.4%, ten basis points higher than last quarter and unchanged from a year ago despite having managed our most active year ever for lease expirations. Additionally, economic occupancy remains strong at 99.2%. During the year we released 253 properties with leases expiring recapturing 101% of expiring rents. As is typical for us we achieved this without any spending on tenant improvements. At the end of the year we had 71 properties available for lease out of 4538 properties in the portfolio. Over the last 20 years, we have re-leased or sold more than 2000 properties with expired leases, recapturing approximately 98% of rents on those properties that were re-leased. Our same store rents increased 1.3% during the quarter and also for the year. We expect annual same store rent growth to remain approximately 1.3% in 2016. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases, approximately 75% of our investment grade leases have rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Additionally, we have never had a year with negative same store rent growth since we started reporting this metric 20 years ago. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type all of which contributes to the stability of the cash flow. At the end of the year are properties were leased to 240 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component, outside of retail, is industrial properties at about 13% of rental revenue. There was not much movement in the composition of our top tenants and industries during the fourth quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6.9% of rental revenue, and drugstores remain our largest industry at 10.9% of rental revenue. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and should be positively impacted in 2016 by Walgreens pending the acquisition of Rite Aid which represents 2% of our annualized rental revenue. The store level performance of our retail tenants remains sound. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio for the retail properties continues to be 2.6 times on a four-wall basis, and the median is also 2.6 times. Moving on acquisitions, during the quarter we completed $204 million in acquisitions, and we continue to see a high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. In 2015, we sourced approximately $32 billion in acquisition opportunities, which is our second most active year ever for sourced volume. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy, acquiring just 4% from nearly $1.3 billion of the amount sourced and continue to see a strong flow of opportunities in our target property types. We continue to expect to complete approximately $750 million in acquisitions for 2016. As always, this principally reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any large scale transactions. Let may hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit?
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John. During the fourth quarter of 2015 we invested $204 million in 104 properties, located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.7 years. On a revenue basis, 28% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 89% of the revenues are generated from retail and 11% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 17 industries. We closed 14 independent transactions in the fourth quarter, and the average investment per property was approximately $2 million. Year end 2015 we invested $1.26 billion in 286 properties located in 40 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.6% and with a weighted average lease term of 16.5 years. On a revenue basis, 46% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 45 different tenants in 21 industries. Of the 49 independent transactions closed during 2015, three transactions were about $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $7 billion in the fourth quarter. During 2015 we have sourced nearly $32 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities 60% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 40% or approximately $13 billion were one-off assets. As to pricing, cap rates remained flat in the fourth quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment-grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter we sold 16 properties for $13.9 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of 10.3%. This brings us to 38 properties sold in 2015 for $65.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized and unlevered IRR at 12.1%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 236 basis points in the fourth quarter which were above our historical average spreads. For the year spreads were 183 basis points. In conclusion, given the continued activity in our space we remain confident in reaching our 2016 acquisition target of approximately $750 million and disposition volume between $50 million and $75 million. With that I'd like to hand it back to John.
John Case: Thanks, Sumit. We had a very active year in the capital markets front. We made our finding needs. And 2015 we raised approximately $1.2 billion in equity capital positioning us well as we entered 2016. We are now at the lowest leverage levels we've been at in ten years with debt to total market cap at approximately 25%. Our balance sheet remains in excellent shape, with plenty of liquidity and financial flexibility. And our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive strong earnings and dividend growth while remaining disciplined with our investment strategy. Last night we announced our 84th dividend increase, representing a 5% increase from this time last year. We've increased our dividend every year since the Company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our AFFO payout ratio in 2015 was 82.9% which is a level we are quite comfortable with. To wrap it up, we had a great year and remain optimistic for 2016. Our portfolio is performing well, and we continue to see a healthy volume of acquisition opportunities. We remain well positioned to act on high quality acquisitions, given our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and cost of capital advantage. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And will go firs to Juan Sanabria of Bank of America.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, thanks for the time, guys. On the acquisition front could you just comment about how you're feeling about opportunities maybe versus three or six months ago? Are you looking at more portfolio deals given it seems like some of the premiums have gone away and any possibilities to partner with third parties to take down larger deals?
John Case: Sure, Juan. First of all, as we look forward on the acquisitions front, we're still seeing a good steady flow of opportunities. And, we're still confident in our $750 million acquisition guidance for this year, and that doesn't include any large scale portfolios or entity level type transactions, but we are constantly scouring the market for opportunities and considering opportunities on a large scale. As far as working with third parties, it is something we would consider. We haven't done that before, but if there were a transaction where perhaps there was a large portfolio where part of the real estate made a lot of sense for us and part of it didn't, we would certainly consider parting with someone who wanted the portion of the real estate that was not consistent with our investment philosophy.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks. And just on your cost of capital front is there any have you guys thought about taking of advantage of where your share price is today and hitting the market now ahead of any potential bigger deal flow that may be coming the way in 2016? Or have you think about that?
John Case: We're constantly monitoring all of the capital markets, equity, debt, preferred. Right now we only have about $350 million outstanding on our lines so we've got capacity of about $1.7 billion, and there's no need to access the markets unless they were particularly appealing or we had any immediate use for the proceeds. So we're paying attention to what's happening out there, looking at it to, but right now we're comfortable where we are as we speak today.
Operator: And will go next to Nick Joseph of Citi.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. I guess, sticking with acquisitions, what are you seeing in terms of pricing of portfolios compared to individual assets?
John Case: Individual assets are now priced a bit more aggressively than the portfolios, which is a flip of where we were a couple of years ago. So, we ended up looking at one off acquisitions are probably trading at cap rates of 20 to as much as 50 basis points inside of where midsize portfolios of comparable properties are trading. So there is a little bit of an [ard] there.
Michael Bilerman: Hey, John. It's Michael Bilerman. As you think about the other side of using your currency instead of just issuing new equity and raising that capital you certainly can use that equity in any sort of M&A. And I'm just curious how, you're a former banker, are you trying to shake the tree loose out of any of your competitors, just given how high your stock trades and where your multiple is in trying to drive some of that in a public to public M&A and leveraging your currency in that fashion?
John Case: We actually are constantly looking at entity level opportunities and given the multiple advantage we have, relative to the sector today, it makes sense for us to consider those opportunities. But, you've got to have to transact you got to have a willing logical seller and a willing logical buyer. So we'll see what may or may happen on that front. But it certainly is something that we're considering.
Operator: And we will go next to Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra: Thanks. Just following up on that the M&A question, just trying to understand, obviously you have the cost of capital if were to just sort of prioritize, what do you do with this cost of capital from here? If we look past at least historically, you've created obviously premiums to the broader REIT group, but that premium has not remained there for a considerable amount of time, so it seems like there's a window and I'm just trying to understand what if you were to prioritize what you do with it? If you could walk us through that it would be helpful.
John Case: Yes, well we have typically traded at a premium to the sector. The premium widens during periods of market volatility and uncertainty like we're seeing today. But for the vast majority of our history we've traded at the highest multiple in the sector. As we look at what we may do with the capital advantages from a cost perspective that we have today we're really -- we want to say consistent with our investment strategies. So, on the retail front it's looking for service oriented non-discretionary low price point businesses that have good real estate and rents that makes sense, structures that makes sense. So we think those assets and property types and tenants are better equipped to work through a variety of economic cycles and to compete with e-commerce. And then on the investor side it's high-quality real estate, leased to Fortune 1000 companies with investment grade credit ratings so those are as the buckets we're really focused on. What we don't want to do is go out and wantonly use a lot of capital to buy properties that aren't consistent with the assets that have worked for the Company over the long-term. So, we don't feel pressured to buy inferior assets at times where a multiple advantage is very significant.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay and then just if you were say hypothetically there were two portfolios of public portfolio, a public Company, and a larger, private portfolio, somewhat similar return price files, similar properties. How do you think about those two, are there factors that dry you towards one or the other at this point, and would you be considering either of them even if sort of your leverage ticks up they are not leverage neutral?
John Case: Well we love to do transactions on a leverage neutral basis, and that's what we've done in the past. Whether it be on the private side or be entity level side. So really what's going to drive which opportunities we pursue is going to be opportunities that result in the most value for the shareholders of our Company. That's how we're going to look at it. We have shown in the past that we can execute public transactions, entity level transactions, or large portfolio transactions. And we do have some leverage capacity today. As you heard that at our lowest leverage levels in the last ten years so we have taken advantage of the capital markets to really strengthen and solidify the balance sheet. So we're very well positioned to grow today where we could take on a bit more leverage than we have today. Our long-term target has been two thirds equity one third debt. As you know we're inside of that today.
Operator: And we will go next to RJ Milligan of Baird.
RJ Milligan: John, to those comments obviously attractive cost of equity here, but how do you think or Paul, how do you think about your cost of debt here? How has it changed over the past couple months? Do you have any visibility where you could issue long-term debt today?
John Case: Ten years -- This is John here. Ten year debt is in the low 4s 4.10%, 4.20%. Spreads have capped out as rates have declined so there hasn't been a big pickup there, Paul, anything?
Paul Meurer: The bandwidth, all in, has really stayed in the 4% to 4.2% range in spite of wherever the Treasury or spreads have moved.
RJ Milligan: Okay in terms of acquisitions this year, has the spread between investment grade and below investment grade shifted at all given the macro volatility? Or would you say that it is still on a risk adjusted basis more attractive to be going after the investment-grade tenants?
John Case: Well I mean we're going to continue -- the spreads really haven't changed the relationship of those spreads. We'll pursue opportunities in both sectors, the ones that meet our investment parameters and make the most sense for us. On the investment-grade side you're seeing some fairly aggressive pricing as Sumit alluded to earlier, around the 5% area on the really higher-quality product. The non-investment grade you're still seeing right around 6% on the higher-quality product. That's not much different than where we were at the end of last year. Cap rates have remained stable, but the ranges on investment-grade, go up to as high as the high six's and on non-investment grade they go up to as high as 8%. The spreads are better today from an investment standpoint given our cost of capital. So, for the year last year, we had investment spreads of 185 basis points on about the $1.3 billion that we acquired. In the fourth quarter, that was more like 236 basis points on the $204 million we acquired. Today, they're running in excess of 250 basis points. So, the margins have never been better than they are now on the acquisitions front. So, we'll be more driven by the opportunities in both the non-investment grade and investment-grade sectors, and we'll react to those versus having sort of a fixed percentage of what we want to buy each. That's consistent with how we've always done it.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Vineet Khanna of Capital One Securities.
Vineet Khanna: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So just for those tenants that provide unit level financials is there anything in those results that suggest a change in economic activity, or are there geographies that are doing better than others or anything like that?
John Case: No, and we are constantly looking at that. The tenant base is in excellent shape. There's some non-material issues as there always are that are factored into our guidance. And so right now we feel good about the tenant base and their health and condition. 
Vineet Khanna: Sure. And then as it pertains to acquisitions, are there any industries that you are looking to invest in or not invest in? And then has there been any change in sort of the buyer or seller pools?
John Case: No significant changes on the buyer seller pool, and the industries are consistent with the ones that we're in. So if you look at the 47 industries we are in today, with very few exceptions, they're going to align with in those industries. We want to stay away from discretionary industries and businesses.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Rob Stevenson of Janney.
Rob Stevenson: It looks like in the fourth quarter according to the supplemental that you guys bought 10 Rite-Aids. Are those basically straight down the middle sort of normal ten year plus leases, or have you guys started to look more opportunistically at some of the Rite Aid locations or even Walgreens locations that have five years or less in it to possibly to do a re-tenanting?
John Case: That was a sale leaseback transaction we did directly with Rite Aid who is an existing tenant of ours, and it was done before the Walgreens announcement so it worked out very well for us. So those weren't one off transactions. It was just a fortuitous timing I would say in terms of when the transaction was executed.
Rob Stevenson: Is there the capability to do anything on an opportunistic basis with short-term lease Rite Aids or even Walgreens where the current owner might be across the Street from something else from one or the other locations, might getting worried that they are going to close down on the location where you guys can buy it at an attractive rate and repurpose it to some other tenant? If that winds up…
John Case: That is not a big emphasis of our business. We pay attention to those opportunities, but we are really looking for assets with long lease terms that are well positioned competitively, and we're not going to have any sort of near-term issues for. If we saw something incredibly compelling we would certainly take a look at it where we had a kind of tenant in our back pocket, and we knew we were going to sign a 20 year lease on favourable terms, on a building that was going to become vacant or vacant, we would certainly look at that. We've done that in the past. Is not a major component of our business, but we have done that in the past.
Operator: And will go next to Ross Nussbaum of UBS.
Ross Nussbaum : Hey, John, good afternoon.
John Case: Hey, Ross.
Ross Nussbaum: It sounds like from some of your earlier comments, regarding acquisitions and in particular M&A it sounds like you are more open to M&A today than you have been in the recent past. Do you think that's a fair characterization?
John Case: I would say given the multiple advantage we have relative to the other 13, 14 companies in the sector that it's a bit more interesting today. But, at the same time, I would say that we want to end up with assets that are consistent with our investment philosophy. So we're not signaling that we go out there just to do a large transaction, take on assets that we couldn't, we'd consider to be of risk in the intermediate to long-term.
Ross Nussbaum: Okay. And, you and I have talked about this topic before but how do you think about net asset value or property value versus investment spread? So even if you theoretically could buy another public player at a multiple that would be accreted to your FFO, what if that meant paying a reasonably high, I don't know what the right word is, premium to the actual value of the assets when you know you can go into the private market all day long and pay actual NAV or property value? How do you balance that thinking?
John Case: We want to be paying NAV whether we're buying in the private market or whether we're buying in the public market. There would have to be something incredibly compelling about the opportunity strategically for us to do that, but we're focused both on spreads and accretion as well as the value of the assets. So we would not want to do anything that would be NAV dilutive.
Operator: And will go next to Amit Nihalani of Oppenheimer.
Amit Nihalani: Hi, good afternoon. Can you guys comment on the difference in cap rates for industrial versus retail?
John Case: Yes, Sumit, industrial versus retail?
Sumit Roy: We haven't really seen much of a movement in cap rates for the type of industrial assets that we pursue which is Fortune 1000 clients with ten plus years. In terms of the cost you're paying right around that $65 to $75 to $80 per square feet for brand new concrete tilt up type of buildings, and that seems to still be the case today. With retail, as depending on the product type it ranges from anywhere between 150 to 250 square feet all the way up to 400, 450 for a C store. So, and again with regards to pricing despite all the volatility that we're seeing in the market, we have not seen cap rates move in one direction or the other. They stayed fairly steady for both those products I'd say over the last six to nine months.
Amit Nihalani: Got it and just bigger picture any changes to the watch list or anything else we should be aware of on that front?
John Case: No. The watch list is down to 1% of revenues which is the lowest it's been in the last five years. Again the portfolio is in good health. There are no material issues for us.
Operator: And will go next to Tyler Grant of Green Street Advisors.
Tyler Grant: Hello, guys. Just a quick question for me. What do you see as being the right size for realty income in terms of assets?
John Case: The right size? In terms of assets? I don't think there is necessarily a right size, but we will continue to grow the Company consistent with our investments strategies and take advantage of the opportunities out there in what is a vast marketplace. So, we do not have a target in terms of size. It's really more about delivering earnings growth and dividend growth and total shareholder return.
Tyler Grant: All right. Sure. In terms of do you think that there would be anything more attractive about just having $25 billion worth of assets instead of having call it $18 billion worth of assets?
John Case: No. I don't think so. This is a very scalable business. When you look at our EBITDA margin that's nearly 94%, it's sector leading. We're delivering more of our revenues to our shareholders than the rest of the sector. Our G&A margin of 5%, very efficient. With size and scale comes increased efficiencies, which really lead to I think a competitive advantage based on size. But we wouldn't grow just to grow, we would grow to create earnings growth and dividend growth with assets consistent with our investment philosophy.
Operator: And we will go next to Todd Stender of Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: The deal flow you're seeing continues to be pretty steady and robust. Can you provide what the mix is maybe just share what the percentages if you look at where the opportunities came from, investment opportunities, came from last year whether they are marketed details, existing relationships or pension funds even bringing you opportunities?
John Case: Sure. So Sumit, do you want to take that?
Sumit Roy: Yes, sure. So Todd, in terms of the portfolio and one-off mix, I would say it's about 25% of what we sourced last year versus even in 2015 was about the same. 25% is one off, 75% portfolio deals. So when you start to focus then on the portfolio deals what we've started to notice is a lot more companies that were sort of hesitant in years past to even engage in conversations dealing with sale lease backs became far more open to those types of conversations, and in fact some of them even resulted in transactions that we were involved in, in last year. Whereas in 2014, most of the product that we saw were from companies that were very familiar with the sale leaseback market and most of the volume driven were by either other sellers of large portfolios both private and public and/or companies that had done sale-leasebacks in the past. So the only real change in terms of the product mix I would say that we saw was new entrants coming in that had not engaged in conversations in years past. But outside of that, one-off versus portfolio, the mix is about the same. It was 26% in 2014 and 25% in 2015. So, I'd say the mix is about the same.
Todd Stender: Is it more compelling, Sumit, just because of pricing -- commercial real estate prices have been so good people are at least considering it now?
Sumit Roy: I would say pricing is definitely one piece of it, but I would also say that there has been a fair amount of external pressures by investors, etcetera rattling the cages and talking about what is it that a particular operating company should focus on. The debt markets have helped. The fact that our cap rates have compressed have helped, but I think the single biggest issue has always, the single biggest driver in my mind has been some of the investors talking about monetizing real estate and getting back to the core business. I think that has been the single biggest factor.
Operator: And we will go next to Rich Moore of RBC Capital Markets.
Rich Moore: So, Sumit, are you sort of saying that -- and, John, that the -- remember when we had all these retailers that wanted to do spins, spins of their real estate, and that is sort of not happening now. The government has kind of shut that down, so is that group of potential sale-leaseback guys coming to? Are you seeing more of that, those pre-spin guys that can't do the spins anymore?
John Case: Yes, I think that was actually favorable news to the net lease industry and companies like ours to the extent they want to monetize their real estate they're going to be talking to us. I do think to add on to what Sumit was saying is that these companies that have large real estate holdings that are not real estate companies are under pressure to increase their own returns on investment and carrying that real estate when it could be sold to someone like us or someone in our sector can certainly enhance their return on investment, so there is that pressure and we're seeing that. The recent news with regard to the ability to do these spins is certainly a net positive to the sector.
Rich Moore: Okay, good, thank you. And then it's interesting because you guys probably don't sit and look at the stock market all day long like a bunch of us on the phone do, but pretty much the only thing green on my screen is you guys. That means the market is worried about something, and I'm curious how you guys monitor for bankruptcies? I mean what's the chance among your tenant base that you can have a surprise in there and how close are you in touch do you think with the health of each of these retailers?
John Case: So we have a -- as you know, you've covered us for a long time, as you know Rich, we have our own internal credit and research team, and we are constantly analyzing and scouring the portfolio in terms of credit and industry trends as well. Currently, our watch list is 1%. Tenants that we have potential credit issues with are just under 6% of the entire portfolio, but most of that doesn't make it on to the watchlist because it's really good real estate and we'd like to have it back, and we think there's upside there. So in terms of our coverages they've held steady right around 2.6, 2.7 we're not anticipating any sort of a tenant -- material tenant the issues. So we to track that very closely and don't see anything there.
Operator: We will go next to Dan Donlan of Ladenburg Thalmann.
Dan Donlan: Thank you, good afternoon. John given your comments on M&A I think you said that public debt the REITs would have to have as that are consistent with your investment philosophy. How many REITs out there do you think have such assets?
Rich Moore: Dan, you are cutting out.
Dan Donlan: Sorry. Can you hear me now better?
John Case: Yes.
Dan Donlan: Sorry about that. Given that you said that as you look at some public to public M&A that another Company would have to have assets that are consistent with your investment philosophy. I was just kind of curious how many REITs are out there that you think have assets that are consistent with your investment philosophy?
John Case: There are a number of them. Are there any that are completely pure? Maybe one or two, but in terms of the REITs that have assets that are consistent with what we're looking for and have a material amount of them, maybe they represent 50% or more. There are a lot of companies out there.
Dan Donlan: I then just kind of curious on the casual dining front. It's been a sector that you guys have steered clear of since the last recession, was just kind of curious, your appetite there. Just going back to Rich's question, given the inability of these REIT conversions to happen there's a lot of restaurants out there that that still own a lot of their own real estate, so just kind of curious your thoughts there?
John Case: Yes so right now, casual dining for us is about 3.5% of our overall revenues, and some of the stumbles the Company has made in the past have been related to casual dining. And we've learned what we want on that front, and so we have a fairly high bar in terms of what we would consider there. We want operating concepts that are stable to growing. We want box sizes that if we ever get them back are of the size that we can be more easily re-let. We want market rents. We want something close to replacement cost as well, and we want coverages that are in excess of what our portfolio averages somewhere around three times. So if we find those types of opportunities, and of course the real estate needs to be attractive as well, we'll pursue them. So, the fact that we've not done many of them is more a function of quality and structure of some of the transactions that have been done versus us saying we won't look at casual dining, because we will look at casual dining. But the parameters around what we will invest in our fairly tight.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Collin Mings of Raymond James.
Collin Mings: First question for me you guys mentioned the watchlist remains low and hasn't really changed much. But can you maybe just highlight what the themes are as you think about the planned dispositions for this year? And could we see some shift maybe towards some more occupied versus vacant properties? And then just as it relates to that issue, going back to Rich's question, could some of the dispositions be maybe in that pool of tenants that aren't necessarily on the watchlist but maybe in lower quality given some of the economic concerns other?
John Case: Yes, I mean on the dispositions front, I think in terms of what would be selling, it will look similar to what it looked like in 2015, maybe a bit more occupied than vacant. We had more vacant than we typically have. And the types of properties on the dispositions front are casual dining, childcare, older generation, non-discretionary -- I'm sorry, discretionary tenants in theory or real estate locations perhaps with credit issues. Or they are higher quality properties, but we're looking to reduce our exposure to certain tenant or to a certain sector. So on the sales front I think you'll see a little more occupied then vacant in terms of the ratio, and we're looking to sell 50 million to 75 million this year, and that's incorporated into our guidance.
Collin Mings: I guess along those lines just as far as how does your economic outlook maybe factor into that at all? I think last year there was some acceleration in your disposition activity. Is there anything from a broader economic perspective that might again cause you to accelerate or want to jettison some more some of that exposure that you highlighted that you are relatively more concerned about?
John Case: No, again when you look at the size of the watch list and it's in your 1%, it's fairly small. So possibly we've had I think our most active year on the dispositions front was about $135 million and we've been as low as 50 million, 60 million. We're kind of thinking 50 million to 75 million, but we remain the right to be flexible there. We certainly did factor in macroeconomic conditions, but it's really that then taken down to the micro level and does it make sense for the reasons I went through to sell an asset or not.
Operator: And this concludes the question and answer portion of Realty income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.
John Case: Okay, thank you very much, Cassandra. Thanks everyone for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you at the conferences coming up and everyone have a good afternoon. Take care. Bye.
Operator: And this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-10-29 14:30:00) =====
Executives: Janeen Bedard - Vice President, Administration Executive Department John Case - Chief Executive Officer Sumit Roy - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer Paul Meurer - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Analysts: Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Collin Mings - Raymond James & Associates Nick Joseph - Citigroup Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets Dan Donlan - Ladenburg Thalmann & Company Inc. Chris Lucas - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Realty Income 3Q 2015 Earnings Call. As a reminder today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Janeen Bedard: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income third quarter 2015 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.
John Case: Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We are pleased with another solid quarter and our position as we move in to the end of the year and the beginning of 2016. Our AFFO per share annual growth during the quarter was 9.4% and a record quarterly amount of $0.70. As announced in yesterday's press release we are raising and tightening the range of our AFFO per share guidance for 2015 from $2.69 to $2.73 to the new range of $2.72 to $2.74 given the company strong year-to-date performance and continued scalability of our business platform. A very high percentage of our revenue continues to flow bottom line. We are also introducing our 2016 AFFO per share guidance of $2.85 to $2.90 representing annual per share growth of 4.4% to 6.2%. I will now hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results.
Paul Meurer: Thanks John. As usual, I’ll provide a few highlights of our financial statements for the quarter and began with the income statement. Total revenue increased 9.8% for the quarter; this increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at September 30 was approximately $992 million. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $64 million. This increase was due to the $250 million 12-year notes we issued in September of last year and $250 million term loan issued at the end of last quarter. As well as the lower amortization of mortgage premiums as our outstanding mortgage balance continues to decline. We also did recognize a non-cash loss of approximately $5.2 million on interest rate swaps during the quarter. As a remainder, we enter into an interest rate swap on the new term loan we issued in June with led to the larger non-cash loss this quarter. On a related note our coverage ratios, both remained strong with interest coverage at 4.2 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.8 times. Both of these metrics are pro forma for the paydown of the credit facility balance with proceeds from our common stock offering earlier this month. General and administrative or G&A expenses were approximately $10.9 million for the quarter. Included in G&A expense this quarter is approximately $70,000 in acquisition costs. And reminder that we include these acquisition costs in our calculation to both FFO and AFFO. Year-to-date our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5.3%. We estimate this 5% will remain our approximate one rate for G&A for the remainder of the year. As efficiencies in our business model continue to drive improving EBITDA margins. Property expenses which were not reimbursed by tenants totaled $3.4 million for the quarter. Year-to-date our property expenses as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 1.5%. We estimate this 1.5% will remain our approximate one rate the property expenses for the remainder of the year. As these expenses have continue to come in lower this year with lower portfolio vacancy, faster releasing of vacant properties, lower property insurance premiums and fewer one-time maintenance expenses. Provisions for impairment of approximately $3.9 million during the quarter including impairments on one property held for sale, one held for investment, and two sold properties. Gain on sales were approximately $6.2 million in the quarter and just a reminder we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Adjusted Funds from Operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.70 per share for the quarter, a 9.4% increase versus a year ago. We again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter and now it equates to a current annualized amount of $2.286 per share. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we’ve continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. In September, we established an ATM or at-the-market equity distribution program to offer and sell up to 12 million shares giving us the ability to issue equity capital on an opportunistic basis. Through quarter-end, we had not yet issued any equity through this program. During the quarter, we did raise $152 million of equity capital through our direct stock purchase plan. And earlier this month we raised $517 million in net proceeds in a common stock offering, we used the proceeds to pay down all outstanding borrowing on our $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rates and continued to be rated BAA1, BBB+ at a weighted average maturity of 6.5 years. We again did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity so our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter and decreased to approximately to $695 million.  Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $2 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due for the balance of this year and our maturity schedule is well laddered thereafter. Currently, our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 28% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2% of our capital structure. And our debt to EBITDA ratio after the equity offering is approximately 5.1 times. Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on these results.
John Case: Thanks Paul. I’ll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.3%, a 10 basis points improvement from last quarter. At the end of the quarter we had 74 properties available for lease out of 4,473 properties on our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.3%, and occupancy based on square footage was 99%, increasing 10 basis points and 20 basis points respectively from last quarter. We continue to see an active leasing environment and expect our occupancy to remain around current levels for the end of the year. We had leases expire on 95 properties during the quarter and we re-leased 97 properties. Additionally, five vacant properties were sold during the quarter, so our vacant property count decreased by seven properties relative to last quarter. 86 properties were re-leased to existing tenants and 11 were re-leased to new tenants, we recaptured 99% of expiring rents without any spending on tenant improvements as it’s typical for us.  We have a lot of experience in the theory of our business. Over the last 20 years we have re-leased or sold more than 2,000 properties with expired leases. Our same-store rent increased to 1.1% during the quarter and 1.3% year-to-date, we expect annual same-store rent growth to be approximately 1.3% this year and next year. As many of you know the timing of our rent increases are irregular and will vary from quarter-to-quarter. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases. So we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties, approximately 75% of our investment grade releases have been only growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography and to a certain extent property type. At the end of the third quarter our properties were leased to 236 commercial tenants operating in 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. Our diversification contributes to the stability of our cash flow 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at 13% of rental revenue. That was really not much movement in the composition of our top tenants in industries during the third quarter. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 7% of rental revenue and drug stores remain our largest industry at 11% of rental revenues. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 44% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants. This drops from 48% last quarter due to the completion of Dollar Trees acquisition or Family Dollar in July which is now rated BB. This percentage will continue to fluctuate and will be positively impacted by two pending acquisitions of our non-investment grade-rated tenants by investment grade-rated tenants.  The store level performance of our retail tenants remain sound, our weighted average rent coverage ratio for the retail properties continues to be 2.6 times on a four wall basis and the median is also 2.6 times. Moving on to acquisitions, during the quarter we completed $124 million in acquisitions and we continue to see a high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. Year to date we had sourced $24 billion in acquisition opportunities and we are on track for our second most active year ever for sourced volume. We remain disciplined in our investment strategy acquiring less than 5% or $1.1 billion of the amount sourced year-to-date. A large portion of the acquisitions completed so for this year occurred earlier than we had originally expected which had a positive impact on our 2015 earnings growth. We continue to expect approximately $1.25 billion in acquisitions volume for 2015. Our initial guidance for 2016 acquisitions is approximately $750 million which possibly reflects our typical flow business and does not account for any large-scale transactions.  I’ll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit?
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John. During the third quarter of 2015 we invested $124 million in 47 properties located in 22 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7% and with a weighted average lease term of 10.9 years. On a revenue basis 35% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 52% of the revenues are generated from retail and 48% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 18 different tenants in 13 industries; some of the most significant industry is represented transportation services, motor vehicle dealerships and quick service restaurants. We closed 10 independent transactions in the third quarter and the average investment for property was approximately $2.6 million. Year-to-date 2015 we invested $1.1 billion in 195 properties located in 36 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with the weighted average lease term of 16.7 years. On a revenue basis 50% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 18 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our health and fitness, drugstores and quick service restaurants. Also 35 independent transactions closed year-to-date, three transactions were about $50 million. The transactions will continues to remain healthy, we sourced more than $4 billion in the third quarter, year-to-date we’ve sourced more than $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 62% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 38% or approximately $9 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 36% for the third quarter. Of the $124 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 77% were one-off transactions. We continued to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over 46-year operating history. As to pricing, cap rates remain flat in the third quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. Our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold eight properties for $21.5 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.2% and realized an unlevered IRR of 14.2%. This brings us to 22 properties sold year-to-date for approximately 52 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.6% and realized an unlevered IRR of 13%. Our investments spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 212 basis points in the third quarter, which were above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less the nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. In conclusion the remain confident of reaching our acquisition and disposition goals of approximately 1.25 billion and 65 million respectively for 2015. With that I'd like to hand it back to John.
John Case: Thanks, Sumit. We’ve been active on the capital markets during the year to need our capital needs. Year-to-date we have raised approximately 1.2 billion in equity capital at an average per share price of approximately $48.50. This includes the $517 million equity offering earlier this month at Paul mentioned. Our balance sheet is an excellent shape with plenty of liquidity and financial flexibility. Our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive earnings growth while investing in high-quality assets. We increase the dividends paid this quarter by 4% on a year-over-year basis. We’ve increased out dividend every year since the company’s listing 1994 growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of just under 5%. Our AFFO payout ratio in the third quarter was 81.4% which is a level we are quite comfortable with. The rapid our portfolios performing well and we are pleased with where we stand as we ahead into the end of the year and into 2016. We continue to realize the efficiencies associated with our size in the economies of scale of our net lease business. We believe our EBITDA margin is the highest in the sector at 93%. We continue to see high volume of acquisition opportunities and our balance sheet is an outstanding condition of exceptional financial flexibility to fund future growth opportunities. At this time, we would like to open it up for question. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good afternoon guys. Just with your 2015 guidance, what factors are driving the still relatively large delta as we approach the end of the year and apply for the fourth quarter? I was wondering if you can give us a sense for what you expect dollar-wise for a percent in the fourth quarter?
John Case: So the large Delta with regard to FFO is a result of swap and the impact that has on FFO and we don’t see that one in AFFO. So it is very difficult to predict forward curve. So you see that it did have a $4 million impact this year it could go down from there so you wanted to make sure we love to range bought out the handle, what we though would be reasonable in terms of movement there.
Juan Sanabria: And then any color on percent rent for the fourth quarter? Any expectations you're thinking about?
John Case: Over the trailing 12 months we’ve received around 4 million in percentage rent, larger quarters are post quarter typically, fourth quarter won't have a large percentage rent we are not expecting the fourth quarter to have a large percentage rent figure in it. So but again those are irregular and we can give surprise as we were in the second quarter with regard of percentage rents. So go ahead.
Juan Sanabria: Just one more quick question on guidance. For 2016 the AFFO is actually higher than FFO. Is that related to swaps again? Because normally it's the inverse, at least if you look at 2015?
John Case: Yes, Juan it is related to that and Paul do you elaborate on that?
Paul Meurer: Yes, so one piece of that is the swaps and making some assumptions to account for potential non-cash gain or loss there. The other issue is less mortgage premium amortization because our mortgage balance has gone down significantly as you can see over time. And then the third piece would be a little bit less capital expenditures spend that we projected for next year 
Juan Sanabria: Great. A last more bigger picture question. With the Walgreens-Rite Aid merger, any thoughts on potential store closures, given overlaps that may be required as per the FTC and competition? And then do you expect the management team to maybe look at any real estate monetizations?
John Case: Let me take a crack at that one. Obviously we view the merger as a net positive for the company, we believe it's a credit and value enhancing event, Realty Income is likely to improve the credit quality, or definitely will improve the credit quality of the portfolio with an additional 1.8% at least of our rent becoming investment grade rated. S&P affirmed the BBB rating yesterday but did put Walgreens on negative outlook, which is normal in these M&A situations. As you recall, when we bought ARCT we were put on negative outlook while S&P waits to see how you execute and finance the transaction. There will be no impact on our revenue as a result of the impossible divestitures, Walgreens will have the contractual obligation to pay the rent through the term. The pundits in the market over the last two days have estimated that anywhere from zero to 400 stores could be closed, so that's quite a range. But on our Walgreens assets we have an average lease term of 13 years. On our Rite Aid assets we have an average lease term of nine years. And there’s really little property overlap and the two portfolios of the 58 Rite Aid locations we own, 15 of those and within a two-mile radius of a Walgreens store and the average lease term is about eight years. So we feel really good about that and we’re pleased with both companies performance. We’ll take our - depending on acquisitions between now and the end of next year, it will take our exposure - percentage of revenues from Walgreens up to somewhere in the high eights probably, right around 9%. But if we are going to have a tenant, that’s a little higher that we typically like the concentrations to be. But if we’re going to have a tenant there we like that it’s Walgreens. And from a drugstore industry perspective there will be no change and our exposure will still be at around 11%.
Juan Sanabria: Okay, thank you very much John.
John Case: Okay, thanks, Juan. I appreciate it.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Collin Mings with Raymond James & Associates.
Collin Mings: Hey, good afternoon, guys.
John Case: Hey, how are you doing Collin?
Collin Mings: First question for me, looks like that the industrial mix picked up a bit during the quarter, obviously relatively low acquisition volume compared to the last few quarters. Can you talk a little bit more about that? It looked like the FedEx exposure ticked up a little bit.
John Case: Yes, so as you know, the acquisitions compositions and amounts vary quite a bit quarter- to-quarter. This quarter we had 52% retail and 48% industrial and there was a FedEx in there. So we did check on some additional revenues from FedEx. It's going to fluctuate in the second quarter we had well in excess of 700 million in acquisition and we had quarters where they’ve been close to zero and quarters where they’ve exceeded billion dollars. It’s certainly volatile. But there's really nothing to read into that, when we look at what we’ve done year-to-date 87% has been the retail and we continue to have 79% of our revenues come from retail property. So you are not going to see that number change much. So it's better than average and it’s just relevant here in the third quarter. 
Collin Mings: Okay. And then I guess you touched on this in those remarks, but given the deceleration in the pipeline, again obviously some larger deals in the second quarter. You still feel pretty good about where your pipeline stands right now and not really any meaningful change in the composition of it? Is that fair?
John Case: Yes, that’s very fair. We are going to have our third best year ever in terms of consolidated acquisitions. We are going to have our second best year ever in term of sourced acquisition opportunities. So there is a lot of momentum in the business and I wouldn't characterize this declining momentum might characterize the typical fluctuations quarter-to-quarter and acquisition volume. So again it's very difficult to predict, but we are certainly comfortable with where the business is and the momentum we have.
Collin Mings: Okay, and then as far as just on the ATM recognizing it is going to fluctuate depending upon where the stock price is, but what should we think about and how aggressive you might be looking to deal with that in any given quarter?
John Case: Yes, I mean we are probably be at 1% or less of our equity markets cap in a quarter, it's not something we're going to used to replace offerings with that it allows us to matching on their acquisitions, be more opportunistic with regard to raising equity and to fund that equity at a much, much lower cost than we do a typical offering, but we will continue to do offerings such as we did post third quarter end.
Collin Mings: Okay, that's helpful. And then one last one for me and I'll turn it over. Bigger picture, any changes to the watch list? Or anything else we should be aware of on that front? I know the last couple quarters you've referenced it being pretty stable. Just touch on that real quick.
John Case: Yes, it’s pretty stable at 1.1% and not everything on there we’ll end up selling so we are as you heard slipping inside, ramping up our dispositions a bit on what we had originally planned for this year from $50 million to $65 million. We are achieving excellent results on our sales and these are – some of them have issues associated with them perhaps credit, real estate issues, coverage issues, industry issues and some we are just selling because we have maybe some concentration issues and you don’t want to reduce our concentration levels, but the fact that we are able to sell these year-to-date at a 77 cap rate, 72 cap rate in the third quarter and achieved an IRR unlevered 14%. I think kind of shows you the quality of our portfolio because we are calling off kind of the lower quality assets in general. So I hope that shows the market that we will get a strong portfolio if that's where those properties we want to dispose of the trading.
Collin Mings: Okay. On that point, as you referenced that cap rate, is it safe to say as you think about the 2016 guidance that you threw out there, that the dispositions that you look to complete in 2016 would likely be at a similar cap rate to what you've done here in 2015?
Paul Meurer: I would think so I mean we budget something little bit more conservative in the high seven and close to 8%, but again it’s going to be a function of the macroeconomic environment and which is more than enough. We are able to – where interest rates in the macroeconomic environment will be next year.
John Case: But I think overall yes I think it’s safe to say we’ll continue to execute the levels we executed at this year.
Collin Mings: Great, appreciate the detail.
John Case: Okay, thanks a lot.
Operator: And we will go next to Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Nick Joseph: Thanks. The $750 million of acquisitions in 2016, what investment spread is assumed in guidance?
Paul Meurer: Yes, we are looking at cap rates that are probably right around what we are achieving now so they are consistent with – we are assuming there are no material changes in cap rates today. So assume those sort of high sixes area, in terms of spreads Paul you want to hit on that in terms of cost of capital. I think we will continued to be in the area north of our long-term average of 150 basis points or 140 basis points will be in the upper 100s maybe up to 175 basis points.
Nick Joseph: Thanks and then just going back the mix between retail and industrial in terms of the acquisitions. Do you expect a similar mix to this year.
John Case: Overall, I think that safe to say, again we see for more opportunities on the retail side and retail oriented 79% et cetera earlier about revenues are coming from our retail properties and do not expect that the change materially next year.
Nick Joseph: And then finally, can you touch on the initial cash cap rate difference between what you've seen for retail acquisitions and industrial acquisitions this year?
John Case: Sumit, do you want to handle that?
Sumit Roy: Yes, sure that’s a very difficult question to answer because it definitely depends on the tenant, on the length of the leads on what kind of especially on the retail side on what kind of an asset it is, but if you what think in terms of an investment grade tenant with 15-year, 20-year lease with growth, they trade right around where in the same ZIP Code and it is very difficult to say that one asset class trade that higher price. Now when you obviously translated on a price per square feet basis et cetera industrial we are looking at high quality industrial assets right around that $70, $75 per square feet ZIP Code and in retail once again depending on whether it’s a Walgreen’s or whether it’s a similar investment grade rated lets called Dollar General they are going to have a different range, anywhere between 175 to 225 to 250.
Nick Joseph: Thanks that’s helpful.
John Case: Thank you.
Operator: We’ll go next to Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: Thanks. For Sumit, for the properties acquired in the quarter, can you give us the range what the lease terms were? The average was 10 years, so that's in line with your existing portfolio, but to look at anything on the shorter side?
Sumit Roy: Yes, look I think we did have some in the high single-digits and a lot of them bunched around that area from the high single-digits around 13, 14 there were a couple of assets that had not 15-year lease that’s part of the reason why we were able to get a slightly better yield.
John Case: You’ll see sometimes in smaller portfolios you might have an average lease yield – an average lease term Todd 12-years but we are going to have some maybe seven, eight years and there certainly in larger portfolios as well. So we target 10-years and above its typically the natural lease terms range from 10 to 25 I think year-to-date but just under 17 years which is a good number for us. And that continue to focus on that in the long-term range in area to be in.
Todd Stender: That's helpful. Was it just the one FedEx you acquired in the quarter?
Paul Meurer: Yes, that’s correct
Todd Stender: Okay. Can you help us with pricing? As a comp, what the cap rate was? Length of lease? And was this more of a FedEx ground facility?
Paul Meurer: It was the FedEx ground that we are not allow to give an specific details on that transaction were subject to confidential reality agreement with FedEx with regard to this specifics and pricing.
Todd Stender: Okay, no problem. For Paul, when you look at your cost of equity, certainly you have the overnight markets open to you. You have the ATM in place, although you haven't tapped it. But the direct purchase plan, you've raised a fair amount of equity this year through that. Is there a low-cost, like an ATM-equivalent cost, to raising that amount of equity?
Paul Meurer: Yes, its actually our cheapest form of raising equity, closer to 1% average cost there of issuance compare to an ATM with this going to be more like 1.5% to 2% and then your overnight offering there going to be more than that obviously. So it is a product that will remain and utilizing with largely with existing shareholders as well as part of that, their ability to reinvest. But not to any significant amount. As John mentioned we’ll be doing a little bit of that activity in quarter going forward. But any larger equity raises would be dependent upon acquisition volume.
Todd Stender: Great, thanks. Lastly, when you look at the Rite Aid properties, if you were to assign a Walgreens cap rate to those going forward, do you guys look at it in terms of how much cap rate compression happened at one fell swoop?
John Case: Yes, I mean if you look at the market today, there's about a 50 to 75 basis points differential between where Rite Aid and where Walgreens would trade. So you’ve got yield of anywhere depending on other factors 50 to 75 basis points higher on a Rite Aid and you got a Walgreens. So you expect that to condense based on Walgreens acquisition.
Todd Stender: Great, thanks John.
John Case: Thank you, Todd.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Rich Moore: Hello, guys, good morning or good afternoon. Did you pull back at all on your acquisition activity due to the softness that we saw in both the debt and equity markets in the third quarter?
John Case: No, we didn’t I mean this is just a function of the opportunities we saw that met our investment parameters. And there’s a lot of volatility from quarter-to-quarter and the amount and quality of acquisition opportunities we see. So, we are very pleased with where our own balance sheet is. We got a lot of financial flexibility and significant liquidity. So we did not specifically pull back on the acquisitions activity as a result of some of the volatility we saw on the marketplace.
Rich Moore: Okay, great, thanks, John. I'm curious, Paul, on the bonds that you're doing or that you might do. Are these going to get bigger do you think? I think of you guys having $5 billion of debt roughly, that kind of thing, and 10-year laddered maturity. So I'm thinking of larger bond transactions when you do them. The last couple seemed smaller and I'm wondering are you going to carry more on your line of credit? Or are you going to do a bigger bond transaction going forward you think?
Paul Meurer: They may get bigger at times of course, as we get larger as a company, you could certainly see larger issuances certainly in the minimum of $250 million to be index eligible something we would always pursue. But at point in time when you go to issue the bond it really depends on what your needs are at that particular time. And if you don't have say $500 million cash needed at that moment, you are not going to issue $500 million bonds that’s happened a few time. And furthermore we haven't quite seen any pricing improvement having a slightly larger offering size. If we would start to understand that you get a little bit better pricing from the debt investors for a larger liquid offering, that something we made and pursue more.
John Case: Yes, it’s been an interesting conversation we’ve had and certainly something we’ve studied Rich and that is do you get paid for larger more liquid offerings and certainly a lot of our fixed income investors would prefer those and say that you do. But when you look at the case studies available and we work with our bankers, you don't see a pricing advantage. But that being said larger company as Paul said, doing larger transactions. I think you’ll see our average transactions certainly grow beyond $250 million. And you could see some $0.5 billion bond deals in our future.
Rich Moore: Okay, is there a negative to going to market too often? Like if you had to do $1 billion and you did four, one each quarter of $250 million, is that a negative?
Paul Meurer: If that was scenario, for example, I think the preference would be to do say, two $500 million rather than four $250 as your fixed income investors would prefer the larger liquidity in each particular issuance, but you can't always project what your needs are going to be in the state of the bond market, the acquisition deal flow timing and that sort of thing of course. 
Rich Moore: Okay, gotcha. And then I wanted to ask you guys, too, about development if I could. I'm trying to figure out exactly -- when I look at the supplemental -- exactly what's happening with development. If I was on page 13, you have investment in 18 development properties in the quarter. Then when you look on page 15, you have 11 properties currently underway. So I'm assuming seven were delivered in the quarter? Is that correct?
John Case: That’s correct.
Rich Moore: Okay, and then as you look forward, that remaining investment on page 15, the $58 million, how should we think about the timeframe over which that's going to occur? On top of that, how many more we might add on a quarterly basis, new properties to the list?
Sumit Roy: Yes, so as of right now, as it says on page 15 we’ve got $58 million of additional commitments to spend and based on the pipeline the next quarter we don't expect to add any new additional development so that number should remain pretty static of course we are going to stand off of that 50 and so you would expect that to go down. In the event, we do get back with some tenants et cetera with regards to redevelopment et cetera. That’s the only reason why that $58 million will change.
Rich Moore: All right, so I should pro rata that $58 million over the next year? Or I guess it's through January, so I guess through the next quarter or so.
Sumit Roy: I have the run rate today, yes.
Rich Moore: Okay. All right, good and thanks guys.
John Case: Thanks Rich.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann.
Dan Donlan: Thank you and good afternoon.
John Case: Hi Dan.
Dan Donlan: Hey. I was wondering if you guys could touch a little bit on the operating expenses and why that continues to come in below your expectations. Your recovery ratio seems to be fairly high relative to what it has been historically.
John Case: Yes, with regard to – are you telling that with regard to G&A or property or both.
Dan Donlan: Frankly both, but just on the property operating expenses, 1.5%, that's a lot lower than what it has been historically.
John Case: Yes, so really we realized probably $4 million to $5 million in savings due to fewer defaults this year and lower vacancy I think an improved stronger portfolio it’s reducing our property expense obligations that the company is responsible for. We are also helping to drive that is much quicker resolution of lease rollovers improved our property insurance premiums as well to become a larger company with scale on. On the G&A front, if you go back and kind of our headcount about three years ago we got some pretty significant additions and headcount and year after that they were fairly significant. And we are really positioning the company to handle the growth that we had anticipated and it would continue. Those hiring have fallen each year. We’ve put really skilful people in place I think and having more efficient organizational structure and more efficient systems which allow us to have better G&A margin. So there are some other items related to that, but that's what it's really about. So when we budgeted this year, we budgeted some headcount and did not end up having to add to the company which helped us come in at $2 million to $4 million below where we thought we were going to be on that item. So that's what really is driving the property expenses and G&A expense margins.
Dan Donlan: Okay, so you're not handing out jelly of the month club, end-of-year bonuses or anything like that, I guess?
John Case: That’s right.
Dan Donlan: So just kind of curious, Paul, on the leverage. At 5.1 times on net debt to EBITDA, looking at my numbers, it seems to be the lowest you've been in quite some time. Is there any type of concerted effort on your part, or on the Company's part, to maintain a lower level leverage than you have over the last couple of years? Or is it simply a function of timing?
John Case: Its really a function of timing, I am not Paul obviously but I want to talk about this sort of philosophy. We are comfortable with the company two-third equity, one-thirds debt right now we are closer to 70%, 71% equity today little more conservatively capitalizing that saw an attractive opportunity to executed in overnight offering at pricing that would be attractive and highly accretive to our investments and we had a use for the proceeds and we want to precision the balance sheet and a very clean and look and ready to find our anticipated acquisitions going into 2016. So this is not a level, this is not a new level that really represents the change in leverage policy for us Dan just a average of the recent launch equity offering.
Dan Donlan: Okay, understood. Is there any type of -- is there any seasonality to 2016's acquisitions? Do you think they'll be more front-end loaded or more back-end loaded or ratably over the year?
John Case: Which we could answer the question this year we thought there going to be more back end loaded giving a couple of larger portfolios we will working on and when those tenants want into close and then two changed and all suddenly we went from expecting back end loaded acquisition here that switch to front end loaded acquisition here. Its really difficult to predict, so in model right now we just add that 750 million based on a pro rate structure throughout the year. It wont happen that happen that way. There will be quarters where there’s big numbers and there will be quarters where there small numbers. Unfortunately I'm not smart enough to tell you which quarters are going to be big and which quarter are going to be smaller.
Dan Donlan: Okay, fair enough. Then from a portfolio standpoint, has the private letter ruling that's gone away, the IRS or FCC or whoever it is, has said they're going to stay away from this stuff, this op-gov prop-co type of structure that people have done. Have you seen any increase in inbound calls to you guys because of this change in policy from the government?
John Case: Yes, we continue to be involved in a number of conversations on that front. We did interpret that as a net positive. Because if you are going to monetize real estate, the IRS has taken that stance, then you sale-leaseback, financing, transactions with companies like ours is the appropriate and best execution we believe. Has there been a sea wave of additional discussions? No, but there is been a slight uptick and we continue to be fairly optimistic that one or two of those will hit and be significant 
Dan Donlan: Okay, thank you very much, appreciate it.
John Case: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And we’ll go next to Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.
Chris Lucas: Good afternoon, guys. John, following up on a couple of the last questions, on the philosophy side, I guess I was wondering if you might be able to remind us what your thoughts are in terms of max category exposure that you would be willing to take and max single tenant exposure that you guys would take?
John Case: Sure, Chris. So what we’ve said single tenant is that we’re comfortable in the mid single-digit range, so call that count of up to 7%, under certain circumstances we would be comfortable going above that, but over the long run, we would like to manage that exposure back down because the diversification is highly important to us on our strategy. So you’ll see that we kind of assuming that the Walgreens-Rite Aid transaction closes, we’ll have a tenant that’s in the upper eights in terms of percentage of revenues. So that will be a tenant that we look very, very closely at it in terms of increasing our exposure in fact we would not want to increase that exposure unless there was just something exceptional in terms of an incredibly attractive investment opportunity and then we have discussions with our team here and with our board to see if we even wanted to do that. On the industry side it's always been, kind of in the lower double digits, sort of 10% to 12% range and we want to remain in that area and right now we are in that area but the diversification is something that we think is important in our type of business.
Chris Lucas: Okay, and then you talked a little bit before about the spread differential between the Walgreens and the Rite Aid leases. Other than credit and obviously lease term length, but are there lease items that are also included in that price differential?
John Case: When you say lease items.
Chris Lucas: Go ahead, sorry.
John Case: Yes, there is more growth in the Rite Aid leases, and there is the Walgreens leases. So I don’t know that's what you were asking about or not, but there are some minor differences in terms of the two types of leases but not major.
Chris Lucas: Okay. Then going back to Dan's question about the private letter ruling arena, have you guys looked at the infrastructure business at all as an opportunity that Realty Income might look at?
John Case: We are seeing so many opportunities and the investments that fall with our investment parameters today that's not something we are really looking at. We do have a group and team here that we're constantly looking at what other alternatives in terms of properties may makes sense for us to pursue, but we are really comfortable with where we are right now and we certainly don't have any plans to go into the infrastructure business.
Chris Lucas: Okay, and then last question, probably for Paul. On the EBITDA or coverage ratio, can you give us a sense of what percentage revenue is actually included in that calc?
Paul Meurer: What percentage of revenue is actually…
Chris Lucas: Yes, I'm assuming it's not 100% of the revenue that you're collecting, right? It's some proportion of the tenants that report that information to you?
Paul Meurer: Well, I’m sorry. Yes, I thought you are talking about debt to EBITDA ratio percentage.
John Case: Yes, so we get that information from kind of the majority of our retailers.
Paul Meurer: That’s just under 70%.
John Case: 70%. Yes, and so that’s where that’s coming from, so it’s not 100% and it’s around 70%.
Chris Lucas: Great, thank you, guys.
John Case: Thank you. End of Q&A
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen that does concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income’s conference call. I’d now like to turn the call back over to John Case for concluding remarks.
John Case: Thanks, Aaron. We appreciate everyone joining today and look forward to seeing most of you in a few weeks at NAREIT. Have a good afternoon and thanks again. Take care.
Operator: And this does conclude today’s conference everyone. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter Operating Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard Vice President. Please go ahead.
Janeen Bedard: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income Second Quarter 2015 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.
John Case: Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We had a very active second quarter and we are pleased to report excellent results from an acquisitions, capital markets and occupancy standpoint. Additionally we were gratified to be added to the S&P 500 Index in the second quarter. Our AFFO per share growth was 6.3% and a record quarterly amount of $0.68 as announced in yesterday's press release we are increasing our FFO and AFFO per share guidance for 2015 given the Company's positive year-to-date performance and the continued scalability of our business. We believe we are the most efficiently run net lease company with the highest EBITDA margin in the sector today. We are raising our 2015 FFO per share guidance to $2.72 to $2.77 from $2.67 to $2.72. We are raising and tightening the range of our AFFO per share guidance to 2.69 to 2.73 from $2.66 to $2.71. As we continue to anticipate another solid year of earnings growth. Now I will hand it over to Paul to provide additional detail on our financial results.
Paul Meurer: Thanks John. As usual, I will provide some brief highlights of our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 11.1% for the quarter; this increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as healthy same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at June 30th was approximately $983 million. On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $58.7 million. This increase was primarily due to our two bond offerings last year the $350 million 10 year notes issued in June and $250 million 12 year notes issued in September. We also recognized a non-cash loss of approximately $900,000 on interest rate swaps during the quarter. On a related note our coverage ratios, both remained strong with interest coverage at 4.0 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.6 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses were approximately $12.6 million for the quarter. Included in G&A expenses is approximately $192,000 in acquisition cost. And note that we do include these acquisition costs in our calculation to both FFO and AFFO. Year to date our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5.3%. Our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 is now approximately $52 million down from our prior estimate of $55 million as we realized lower than expected expense growth given the efficiencies of our business. Property expenses which were not reimbursed by tenants totaled $3.3 million for the quarter. And our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 remains unchanged at approximately $20 million. Provisions for impairment of approximately $3.2 million during the quarter includes impairments we recorded on three properties classified as held for sale and two properties classified as held for investment. Gain on sales were approximately $3.7 million in the quarter and just a reminder we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.69 for the quarter, a 7.8% increase versus a year ago. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.68 per share for the quarter, a 6.3% increase versus the year ago. Dividend paid increased 4% in the second quarter and we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of $2.28 per share. Now let me briefly turned to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative capital structure. As you know in early April we raised approximately $276 million of new equity capital in conjunction with our addition to the S&P 500 Index. The index inclusion was an excellent opportunity to raise capital at a very low cost by offering shares to the index funds needing to buy our stock on that day. We raised an additional $106 million of equity capital during the quarter through our direct stock purchase plan. Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rates and continued to be rated BAA1, BBB+ at a weighted average maturity of 6.7 years. At the end of the quarter we recapped and expanded our unsecured acquisition credit facility from $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion comprised of a $2 billion revolving credit facility and a $250 million term loan which is due in 2020 when we have no scheduled unsecured debt maturities. At our current BBB+ BAA1 credit rating the borrowing rate on the revolver is LIBOR plus 90 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 15 basis points which overall represents a 20 basis point reduction for the all in drawn borrowing rate of the previous facility. We very much appreciate the capital commitments from the 21 banks that participated in the syndication of this larger facility for us. Our new $2 billion credit facility had a $430 million balance at June 30th. We did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity so our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $757 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $40 million in mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015 and our maturity schedule is well lathered thereafter. Currently our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 32% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt to EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 5.9 times. Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on the quarter.
John Case: Thanks Paul. I’ll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.2%, a 20 basis points improvement from last quarter. At the end of the quarter we had 81 properties available for lease out of 4,452 properties on our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.2%, and occupancy based on square footage was 98.8%, both up 10 basis points from last quarter. We continue to see good leasing activity and expect our occupancy to remain around current levels for the end of the year. We have leases expire on 80 properties during the quarter and we re-leased 81 properties. 73 of those properties were re-leased to existing tenants and 8 for re-leased to new tenants recapturing 106% of expiring rents. This compares favourably to our historical recapture rate of approximately 98% of expiring rents. Additionally four vacant properties were sold during the quarter. Our same-store rent increased 1.5% during the quarter and 1.4% year-to-date. The industry is contributing the most to our quarterly same-store rent growth for health and fitness and motor vehicle dealerships. We expect same-store rent growth to remain about 1.4% for the foreseeable future. 90% of our leases have contractual rent increases. So, we remain pleased with the growth we are able to achieve from our properties leased to both our investment grade and non-investment grade tenants. Approximately 75% of our investments grade leases had rental rate growth that averages about 1.3%. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type. At the end of the second quarter, our properties were leased to 235 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. Our diversification contributes to the stability of our cash flow. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at 13%. This quarter we reclassified 14 assets previously classified as manufacturing properties representing approximately 2% of rent for our investor category which better reflects these properties’ uses and better clarify our portfolio composition. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants without service, non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. Today more than 90% of our retail revenue comes from businesses with these characteristics which better positions them to successfully operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete with ecommerce. At the end of the second quarter, our top 20 tenants continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. Our largest channel is Walgreens which now accounts for 7.1% of rental revenue, the increase from 5.5% at the end of the last quarter. We continue to like Walgreens’ business their high quality real estate locations and the rent growth we received. We also were confident in the strength of these properties given the visibility we have into their unit level performance. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 4.9% of rental revenue. This quarter we added a new name to our top 20 tenants. Life Time Fitness is now our 13th largest tenant representing 2% of that. During the second quarter, we executed a sale lease back transaction with Life Time Fitness. Life Time Fitness is the tenant we had been meeting with and pursuing for about 10 year now. We followed them through challenging and favourable economic conditions and have been impressed with the performance of their business. We also believe their well located real estate and excellent surrounding demographics and the service orientation of their business make them a great addition to our portfolio. Drug stores remain our largest industry at 10.7% of rental revenue and increased from 9.6% at the end of the first quarter. The drug store industry continues to be an area we favour given the ageing of our population and today's healthcare trends. The convenient store industry is our second largest at 9.4% of rental revenue. Dollar stores are at 9.1% down 20 basis points from last quarter as many of you may know Dollar Tree completed its acquisition of Family Dollar this month subsequent for our second quarter end. As part of the transaction in FTC identifying 330 of the combined 14,000 stores for the divestiture, there was no financial impact on our rental revenue as a result of these divestitures. Pro forma Dollar Tree will represent 4.3% of rental revenue health and fitness is our fourth largest industry at 7.2% of rental revenue a 40 basis points increase from last quarter. Health and fitness is the sector we have been invested in since 1998 and it has performed very well for us we continue to like health and fitness given the favourable demographics supporting this industry. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 48% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. The store level performance of our retail tenants remain sound, our weighted average rent coverage ratio for the retail properties is 2.6 times on a four wall basis and importantly the median is also 2.6 times. Moving on to acquisitions we had a very active second quarter investing 721 million at an initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and initial average lease term of over 18 years. This is the second highest quarterly volume and property level acquisitions in the Company's history. Our straight line cap rate during the quarter was 7% which reflects the attractive rent growth of the acquisition. For the first half of the year we completed 931 million in acquisitions at an initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and an initial average lease term of nearly 18 years. Cap rates remain aggressive but stable. However our investment spreads continue to be favorable and remain above their historical norms. We continue to see a high volume of acquisition opportunities. During the quarter we sourced about 10.5 billion in acquisition opportunities which brings us to 20 billion in sourced opportunities for the year. Given our acquisitions activity to-date and the high volume of opportunities we continue to see we are increasing our acquisitions guidance for 2015 to approximately 1.25 billion from our previous estimate of 1 billion. We continue to selectively sell non-strategic assets and redeploy that capital into properties that better fit our investment strategies. During the first half of the year we sold 14 properties for $30.5 million. We sold our least non-strategic assets at a cap rate of 7.8%. We continue to expect a minimum of 50 million in dispositions for 2015 and that figure could go up a bit. Now I'll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in more detail.
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John. During the second quarter of 2015, we invested 721 million in 100 properties located in 33 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 18.2 years. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property including all expenses borne by Realty Income. On a revenue basis, 49% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants and the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment grade or not rated. 98% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 2% are from industrial. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants and 13 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are health and fitness, drug stores and home improvement. Of the 16 independent transactions closed in the second quarter two transactions were about 50 million. Year to date second quarter 2015 we invested 931 million in 166 properties located in 35 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 17.5 years. On the revenue basis 52% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants and the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment grade or not rated. 92% of the revenues are generated from retail and 8% are from industrial these assets are leased to 27 different tenants in 16 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our health and fitness, drug stores and quick service restaurants. Of the 25 independent transactions closed year to date three transactions were about 50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy, we resources more than 10 billion in the second quarter. Year-to-date we have sourced approximately 20 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, 66% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 34% or approximately 7 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 21% for the year-to-date. Of the $721 million in acquisitions closed in the second quarter, approximately 5% were one-off transactions. We remained selective and disciplined in our investment approach closing on less than 7% of deals sourced and continued to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships. As to pricing, cap rates continued to remain tight in the second quarter with investment grade properties trading from around 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. As John highlighted, our disposition program remained active. During the quarter, we sold five properties for 8 million at a net cash cap rate of 8.1% and realized an unlevered IRR of over 11.6%. This brings us to 14 properties sold year-to-date for 30.1 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8% and realized an unlevered IRR of 12.3%. Our investments spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy averaging 140 basis points in the second quarter, which were around our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less the nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Year-to-date based on the weighted average cost of the long-term capital raised our estimated investment spreads were approximately 200 basis points, notably above our historical average. In conclusion the second quarter investments remain solid at 7.21 million while sourcing more than 10 billion in transactions. Our year-to-date spreads remained about historical levels. We continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We are also taking advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to dispose assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2015 to approximately 1.25 billion. With that I'd like to hand it back to John.
John Case: Thanks, Sumit. We are pleased to have taken advantage of the capital market conditions during the first half of the year, that satisfied the majority of our capital needs for acquisitions year-to-date, raising 484 million in equity capital at an average per share price of approximately $50 and issuing a $250 million unsecured term loan at 2.7%. Additionally our new $2 billion revolving credit facility was recapped at a lower rate than our previous revolver and provides for additional financial flexibility as we continue to grow our company. Our sector leading cost of capital continues to allow us to drive earnings growth while investing in high quality assets. We increased the dividends pay this quarter by 4% on a year-over-year basis. We have increased our dividend every year since the Company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of almost 5%. Our payout ratio in the second quarter was 83.7% which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. Finally to wrap it up, we continue to maintain excellent momentum in our business. We continue to have very active dialogues regarding potential acquisition opportunities with existing and perspective tenets. We remain well positioned to execute on acquisitions with approximately 1.6 billion available on our new $2 billion revolving line of credit. At this time, I would like to open it up for questions, operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Josh Dennerlein: This is actually Josh Dennerlein with Juan Sanabria. Two questions for you guys. First, can you talk about the specific cap rates, rent coverages and annual rent bumps for the Walgreens in Life Time Fitness portfolios?
John Case: No, we're not allowed to talk about the specifics of the Walgreens transaction based on non-disclosure agreement, we've executed with them.
Josh Dennerlein: Okay. How about Life Time Fitness, any -- could you maybe talk about how you thought about alternative values and residual values for the assets?
John Case: Yes I can walk you through Life Time Fitness, obviously it is an industry we like we've been in that industry since 1998. There continues to be a secular shift to healthy lifestyles and we're seeing that in the health and fitness facilities. We see that, with both baby boomers and millennials. And health club usage continues to rise. We saw attractive risk-adjusted returns in this investment. It's well structured with a strong cash flow coverage of 3.2 times and a drop in sales to breakeven on our property to 45%. If you look at the last recession the great recession Life Time same-store revenues fell by just under 3% in 2008 and about 7% in 2009 and then turned positive in subsequent years. So, they performed quite well during some very challenging times. The properties that we own are located in the affluent dense markets with high on average household incomes of 74,000 within a 5 mile radius and in densely populated areas with 217,000 people within a 5 mile radius of our properties. We were able to execute this transaction at about a 20% discount to replacement cost and have a portfolio of properties that are well above the average sales. And EBITDAR levels of the overall cause so we were quite pleased with it. The going in cap rate was 6.5% the straight line cap rate which would reflect the growth and the cash growth in the lease over the lease term was about 8%. So, we were pleased with the growth. As we look at the transaction, we really viewed it more as something and when you ask 10 years of financial and operating history and our credit and research team analogue that quite subtly. And we were convinced that these would continue to be operated as health and fitness clubs. If there had to be a residual use the most likely residual use would be office if they could not be used as health clubs but there are other companies that have operated large health clubs of this size including Club Core, Equinox and Bay Club. So they could be potential tenants as well. So, if we were to convert these to office, they are probably looking at something from $50 to $75 a foot to make these office properties but that's not really having looked at it.
Operator: We will go next to Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Nick Joseph: I'm curious, what the impact is of interest rate volatility in terms of your conversations with potential sellers?
John Case: Well it comes up some there's been a fair amount of it and it comes up in discussions where we're talking about pricing and it is something certainly that witnessed a down swing, sellers are trying to put pressure on us and when there's an upswing in the 10 year treasury rate we are certainly are pushing for more yield with regard to our initial cap rates and our overall cap rates.
Nick Joseph: You've historically seen a correlation between increased volatility and less acquisition volume or do you think it's more just on the pricing?
John Case: No, I mean we've been in an environment that has been volatile with regard to interest rates as you've seen and we've sourced year-to-date $20 billion in acquisition opportunities which puts us on a pace that would break our all time high in terms of sourced acquisition opportunities.
Nick Joseph: And then tell us about the decision to issue the five year debt versus doing a longer dated maturity?
John Case: Yes, sure we did issue the $250 million of five year unsecured note with our bank growth and it was really done for several reasons. One is we did have a window in our maturity schedule at five years and one of the issues with the banks has been that we typically not kept a lot of outstandings on our revolver. And they were looking for more funded balances, so when we had 21 banks step up and connect to a recast new expanded facility of $2 billion and we wanted to make sure we were meeting some of their demands and some of their desires as well and something they had asked for was a concurrent term loan with a revolver and they were much more comfortable and desirable on a five year term than a 10 year term where we also have a window on our maturities. So, that drove it and very attractive pricing, pricing well inside of where we could have gotten a five-year unsecured note issued in the unsecured debt market.
Nick Joseph: Thanks, and then I guess with over 400 on the credit facility and then 150 million coming due later in this year. Should we expect a 10 year offering later?
John Case: We're going to look at our capital options as the markets evolve over the remainder of the year and determine how we want to fund the business based on what the market share was. So it could range from all types of capital now from 10 year longer to equity as well.
Operator: We'll go next to Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra: Just to clarify on Life Time. Can you may be I guess you looked at some of the other tranches or portfolios or with tranches within Life Time that were being marketed. What were maybe some of the differences it sounds like maybe the term of the rent pumps were different from something that one of your peers took about?
John Case: The portfolios were all very similar. And we were obviously pleased with the portfolio we received and were able to work with Life Time in structuring that portfolio and it met our demands and it also met the desires of the Life Time team.
Vikram Malhotra: But your rent bumps were higher or your term was different from the other portfolios?
John Case: Our lease term was 25 years which I think is different than the lease term on some of the other portfolios I believe.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay and then as you look at these couple of portfolio you've done. Is there -- are they under a master lease and can you -- do you have the ability to if you choose to maybe sell a few of the assets?
John Case: Yes they're under a master lease but we have no intention of selling the assets that are in that portfolio.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay and then just maybe last one if you look forward if you look at your guidance obviously it bakes in about 150 million a quarter which is a bit lower but I'm assuming that’s just kind of the baseline acquisitions the relationship driven ones. And so over and above that there could be other portfolios that you may close?
John Case: Yes the acquisitions status we have provided for the year assumes our one-off transactions as well as our smaller portfolio transactions and we did not factor in any large sale lease back or very large portfolio transactions?
Vikram Malhotra: And just what cap rate are you assuming for the back half of the year?
John Case: As we look forward we think cap rates will be in the mid to high 6s for the type of properties we buy.
Operator: We’ll go next to Tyler Grant with Green Street Advisors.
Tyler Grant: You guys have done a good job raising the bar for the net lease sector on real estate related disclosure. With that said it seems that a good next progression should be to improve disclosure related to the quality of the lease contracts. So for example the percentage of tenants that report unit level financials investment amounts relative to replacement costs or the proportion of assets that are not operating but are paying rents. Can you provide some numbers for lease data points now and maybe for similar data points that you believe are worth mentioning. And then also going forward what's the feasibility of providing this type of data systematically within your quarterly financials?
John Case: Yes I mean we will continue as we have done this quarter to add data to our supplemental investor package which we agree with you is the most robust in the industry. A lot of our competitors are not providing anywhere near the level of information we are. And we certainly have issues with some of the information that present competitive issues for us to consider. So we're going to see where the industry involves to our and continue to add and tweak our supplemental package. But in terms of just a full dump of everything we're not anticipating doing that for competitive reasons at this point.
Tyler Grant: And I guess if I look at it even if we got aggregate numbers. So for example the converge ratio of 2.6 that you guys disclosed. What percentage of your retailers are actually providing you with financials so that you can arrive at that figure?
John Case: Yes so just under 70% of our retail tenants providers’ sales and profit and loss information. So that should give you an idea of what that number is.
Operator: We'll go next to Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann.
Dan Donlan: John or Sumit we're just curious the releasing spread of 107 was up nicely versus the first quarter and seems to be quite higher than I would have expected given kind of the nature of your business. Can you maybe talk about why the leasing spread was so positive was it any one tenant or any detail would be helpful?
John Case: Yes I mean the primary reason why as we were able to retain 90% of our existing tenants this quarter. And those tenants typically have options to renew those options have a fairly significant cost to them. So they exercise the options to renew and that resulted in the high rent relative to the expiring rent.
Dan Donlan: Okay. And then just...
John Case: Go ahead.
Dan Donlan: Yes, and I was asking another question, the -- as far as your tenants that are not rated, could you maybe give us a percentage of those tenants that are not rated because they don't have any debt in other words they would be investment grades but they just don't have any debt or do you have any metrics on that?
John Case: Well, we do and I don't have them off the top of my head there are a number of tenants you're talking about the 52% non-investment grade rated tenants?
Dan Donlan: Right.
John Case: I would say that you can get that figure but we don't have that right now. I mean some are rated and are below investment grade and some are simply not rated and have excellent balance sheets but are just not rated.
Dan Donlan: Okay. And then I guess a question for Paul. The $20 million of un-reimbursed property expenses seems fairly high, given that you've only recognized, I think 7.3 million year-to-date. So just kind of curious, is there some type of seasonality in this number or are you just being conservative or is there some type of onetime items you're expecting?
Paul Meurer: And that's good observation. So, the property expenses have come in a little bit lower maintenance utilities, bad debt expense is lower kind of across the board. There is a little bit of seasonality, typically the second half of the year, un-reimbursed property expenses are higher. But to be candid that 20 million is a number we're monitoring and we suspect that, that could be a high estimate we shall see as the year progresses but the second half for the year typically is a little bit higher.
Dan Donlan: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just on the G&A, coming down 3 million, you briefly touched on it but, we are just kind of curious, if you could give us a little bit more detail, I mean, did you just not need to hire as many people or kind of what was more detail would be helpful?
John Case: I can provide that, we did realize some specific cost savings that we had not anticipated in October, when we originally constructed the G&A budget for this year and those were really in our legal area with insurance. And with our annual report and when you handle that this year and those on a combined basis were seven figure number with regard to savings. We also saw that we are more appropriately staffed for our activity than we had expected to be last October. Over the last four years, we have increased our headcounts here by 50% and we have added a lot of skilled excellent staff members, team members who have done a great job. So, we're really beginning to realize the efficiencies and the scalability of our business and this was a conscious decision we made several years ago, that build the team, anticipating the growth in the sector and certainly our continued growth. So, that's what you're seeing in that G&A line. And we're certainly pleased to see it. And I would expect our G&A margins to continue to be at this level or even continue to decline.
Dan Donlan: And then just last one for Paul more or John. Just kind of curious on the decision to swap out that the term note you really don't have a lot of floating rate debt and I can understand being conservative but why not just have a little bit more floating rate debt at this point in time, what's the thought process there?
Paul Meurer: We looked at that, in fact when we were making that decision, we took a look at our peer group inclusive of not only the net-lease sector but our S&P 500 peers and what our floating rate debt exposure looks like in our balance sheet, we compared very favourably, even if we had not swapped out that term loan, we would still be very much in the low-end of that spectrum in terms of exposure to variable rate and floating rate debt in our balance sheet. But ultimately we came to the decision that we wanted to continue to handle the balance sheet as we have historically, which is to lock in longer term generally unsecured fixed rate alternatives there that much fund, our acquisitions and not to be exposed to any rising interest rates going forward and the volatility that that's associated with. But right now other than our credit facility the only exposure we have to variable rate debt is the $15.5 million of mortgage debt exposure.
Operator: We'll go next to Todd Lukasik with Morningstar Capital.
Todd Lukasik: Just one on the same-store rents, I noticed motor vehicle dealerships were a large contributor up 17% in the quarter, can you just explain how you got such a big jump? Is that just bigger re-leasing spreads upon expiration and renewal or it is something else going on there?
John Case: Really it was a function of percentage rents that drove that. Trading with those which is our largest motor vehicle dealership kind of had a particularly strong first half of the year and as we see economy recover, we've seen RV sales grow quite a bit and as a result they took in some percentage rents which derive that number.
Todd Lukasik: Is that something that resets the base rents higher then or is that potentially a headwind at some time in future quarters?
John Case: No, it doesn't reset the base rent.
Todd Lukasik: And then I think historically you guys have had a bit more preserved equity in the capital structure. I'm just wondering if you could go through your thought process on that is it likely to increase again on a go-forward basis there is preferred too expensive at this point relative to other funding sources?
John Case: Right now, it is not priced appropriately, it's something we always looked at and we do have about 2% out there in preferred right now. But it's been more efficient and effective for us to use alternative forms and capital given where that market is right now. There's certainly windows in that market where it's attractive and we will consider reassuring but currently that opportunity does not exist.
Todd Lukasik: Okay and then just one last one from me. Can you comment on what percentage of the transactions that you evaluate and maybe also the percentage of transactions that you close if the number is different? That are off market as opposed to being marketed to a number of potential buyers or is there everything just so competitive that it is all on market stuff?
John Case: Well I mean most of what we did this year has been relationship oriented. It's over 90%, but that doesn't mean we were the only firm to look at the acquisition. That could be a strictly negotiated transaction with the tenant or seller which some have been but it also could mean they accepted our price at a lower price in order to do business with us given the strength of our relationship or they gave us a last look at the pricing on the transaction and an opportunity to top the competitor based on the relationship. The two large sales lease backs that we did this quarter were really during primarily on relationship basis although as we have already discussed, the Life Time was shown doing select few players in this sector.
Operator: We're going next to Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: Just to beat a dead horse on the Life Time deal, I recall you get to pick and choose somewhat when the BJ's wholesale portfolio went to a few buyers, was that the case with this deal, I mean how much more real estate could you have acquired and did you get first look?
John Case: There were just a select few firms in this business that got the first look, so we were not the exclusive one. And we did have an opportunity to help construct the portfolio that we ended up with.
Todd Stender: And then just as part of the underwriting with the tenant now that's owned by private equity firm, is there an extra margin of safety that you factor in versus say doing a sale-leaseback with an owner that may have a longer term ownership time horizon?
John Case: No, we certainly approached the private equity driven transactions with caution for a good reason. Generally there time horizon is shorter in terms of their investment in the business than a corporate tenant driven transaction. However in this case the senior and executive management team are likely be to remain major owners of the company and continue to own it. So, that was a bit unique, but even given that you heard me earlier, Todd, walk through the metrics. We structured this transaction very conservatively so we feel very comfortable with that. But we certainly have the added comfort of knowing that the CEO and the management team are heavily invested in the equity of this company going forward.
Todd Stender: Okay, thanks John. And Paul, your line is credit, obviously expanded. It now has a $430 million balance. How do you evaluate how big a balance remains comfortable I guess in your eyes, is it relative to how much availability you have? Is it a percentage of total debt? What kind of measurement steps do you use?
Paul Meurer: Overall, we are always going to look at the overall leverage in the organization. And that would be a piece of that leverage, right? So, you can’t just look at it by itself. The nice thing about having a larger facility, as it just generally gives us more flexibility. It allows us to I don’t want to say time to permanent capital markets but at least be available when something is attractive either in equity or in bonds or whatever it might be and having a larger line carrying a little bit more balance still doesn’t jeopardize the liquidity that we like to have available there for our acquisition efforts. So it is just is a net positive for us in terms of our acquisition approach going forward having that liquidity and then having the flexibility to do something when the timing is right relative to the market. But we don’t look at it by itself we look at it as a piece of the raw capital structure and that our primary exposure if you will to variable rate debt.
Todd Stender: Okay and then looks like you used the five year term loan at a pretty low coupon to fund some of the Q2 acquisitions. That would done at a cap rate closer to six than say your traditional 7% is it fair to say that we won't be seeing those low cap rates in your acquisitions going forward just because you'll be probably tapping longer term capital?
John Case: Yes I think from a cap rate standpoint what we'll be looking at are cap rates for the remainder of the year and the mid to upper 6s. And we really didn’t find that finding acquisition sort of luring the year at more aggressive cap rates at shorter term debt because the cap rates were lower it was really more a function of what I explained earlier and that once that we had the five year window in our maturity schedule and the banks were very supportive about having a balance outstanding through them since our historical utilization of the line of credit had been minimal.
Operator: We'll go next to Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Rich Moore: And Paul I have a question for you too on the expenses and the tenant reimbursements. We calculate an expense recovery ratio and so we look at the percentage that you get back and that jumped in the quarter because you got a bunch of tenant reimbursements and a lot of extra operating expenses. Is that the right way to think about it because as you do more acquisitions right you're going to assume some of sort of tenant recovery rate that isn’t 100%. And then why do you think that would have jumped in the second quarter?
Paul Meurer: Yes I saw that dialogue in your piece and any look at as we have mentioned EBITDA margins for the business I think is a very good way to look at it. Because we think we’re very efficient not only in our G&A but in our property expense side. There is no trend there Rich each lease has its own element of negotiation or if it is an existing lease that we assume relative to the nature of what might be reimbursed or what we may or may not be responsible for. So there is no real trend to look to there in terms of expenses being reimbursed any more or less now or going forward. Other than to say that we expect that to be continue to be a very efficient line item less than 2% of our overall revenues in the portfolio in the property expense area.
Rich Moore: And then as you get acquisitions I assume going forward you're not going to get 100% recovery. So we got to think about as we grow your portfolio with acquisitions we got to put some of that as non-recovered expenses as well?
John Case: It depends on the type of acquisitions we're doing. The majority of them are all recoverable, so we would not anticipate that percentage 2% moving very much in fact it may come down a bit especially given some of the recent acquisitions we've made.
Rich Moore: Then I'm curious when you guys when you did your 200 basis points spread calculation to the cost of assets with the cost of capital. What stock price did you initially said it was a long-term sort of view. But I mean like what roughly was the stock price used to get something like that?
John Case: Yes so it was just a shade under $50 it was 49.70. If you look at the V-Lock of our capital for the first six months of year and look at our spreads on our acquisitions year to date based on that number. The spreads are 170 basis points, so 80% we funded 80% of the acquisitions we've done year to date and based on the cost of the actual funding we viewed our spreads to our weighted average cost of capital were 200 basis points which was the number you heard too as I said earlier. Does that answer your question?
Rich Moore: Yes it does, yes thank you John. So as I think about yes it does very much thank you as i think going forward then at the current share price they are not substantially below then I mean a little bit below that. But I guess it wouldn’t hurt your spreads significantly even the issue equity here?
John Case: Our cost of capital overall right now is running just below 5% so it's still attractively priced. So, if we can continue to buy assets at initial spreads 150 to 175 basis points based on our anticipated cap rates for the reminder of the year, those cap rates are still -- those spreads are still comfortably above our historical averages so we’d be pleased with that. Our cost of equity is reasonable at this level. And certainly our debt costs while they have come up a little bit we can still issue 10 year debt right around 4%.
Rich Moore: Okay. Good, thanks. And then the last thing I had was on your build to suite or your development pipeline it seems like just I'm assuming it is moving in and out of there because you had fewer projects, I think with higher cost. I mean do you have any sort of summary of what happened in the quarter, I mean, deliveries that kind of thing?
John Case: Sure, Sumit can handle that that fluctuates, it's a little higher and we have just under 92 million under development right now. And we have funded it at this point about 25 million of that.
Sumit Roy: Yes that's exactly right, John. You have got 65 million of unfunded obligations. Most of the developments that you're seeing Rich is with our FedEx expansions. That continues to be a higher yielding investment for us and those are investments that, it allows us to continue to push out the leases beyond the original exploration when we do an investment for them. Along with FedEx we're also ding investments in AMCs that continues to be a good investment and we do have some build to suit on the retail side that I do not wish to disclose the name at this point but those continue to be a higher yielding form of our investment opportunity set.
Rich Moore: Okay and so each quarter, Sumit, what do you think you’d add roughly to the pipeline?
Sumit Roy: Each quarter, our run rate has been right around this 90 million unit it has fluctuated from anywhere between 70 units it's been as high as 110. So, about 90 million seems to be rightly would like to be a bit more, given the size of the company, I think you've heard John mention that we would like to see it go as high as 250 but we've not been able to achieve that so the run rate historically has been right around what you see it today.
Operator: We will go next to Collin Mings with Raymond James.
Collin Mings: I guess my first question just as far as the mix of industrial going forward, I know obviously few large deals impacted the mix here in the second quarter but can you just talk about in the deal pipeline as you are looking at the more industrial deals and has there been any shift to how you think about the investment great mix historically pretty high on the industrial front so just put just more color on that if you could?
John Case: Yes, we're really reacting Collin to the opportunities we see in the marketplace. So, we have very high retail numbers year-to-date and for the quarter and we continue to see attractive industrial opportunities but some of those opportunities are very aggressively priced today and we've elected to pass on them. So it's hard to predict the future but we will continue to be active on the industrial front and look at the opportunities that our investment parameters and are priced appropriately for us. And we will certainly continue to look at those investment grade and non-investment grade retail investments as we've done.
Collin Mings: Okay and then I guess, kind of switching gears, just as far as I'm casual dining I am just curious here about I mean you guys have brought exposure down I think it was north of 10% a few years ago now down to about 4%, can you just remind us how you are thinking about that sector particularly just in context of going out there looking to sell assets at a 55 cap?
John Case: Yes, I mean we continue to look at the QSR and casual dining sector they each separately represent 4% of our revenues and we've always been cautious on casual dining as you know, as you alluded to. For our casual dining investment for us, we want to see an operating concept that has positive trends, we want to see really healthy coverage, coverage beyond what we seen in our overall portfolio, probably three times or greater. We want to see rents that are approximately at market and we want to be add approximately replacement cost on our investments. So, we have a high hurdle there, we have looked at some casual dining investment opportunities and we continue to do that. We haven't seen any on a large scale portfolio basis that meet our parameters for I'd say quality and pricing but we would certainly consider the right type of casual dining transaction.
Collin Mings: Okay. Now that's helpful color. Then just real quickly, can you give us any what the watch list is as a percent of revenue, I don't know, if I missed that, and has there been any shift on that front?
John Case: Yes it's still at 1.2% which represents about 150 million in properties and what I have said earlier was on the dispositions front, if anything, I mean we had budgeted for 50 million in dispositions, if anything that could check up a bit, and we may sell a little more and that is obviously coming from that watch list, so we prepare it down just a shade, but it's been kind of steady right around 1.2% for the last several quarters.
Operator: We'll go next to Ross Nussbaum with UBS.
Ross Nussbaum: Hi guys it's been a long call, but I've got two questions for you, the first is on your re-leasing spreads, or I guess more specifically, the spreads when you re-leased to a new tenant. If I think back 10-15 years ago, to the Realty Income I grew up with, there was a lot of talk about making sure that the rents on acquired properties on the portfolio were around market and that was one of the considerations for acquisitions. So, I guess it's a little disappointing to see these properties getting re-leased at down 30% to 35%, what exactly is going on with -- it's not a completely insignificant number of properties that it's such a dramatic roll down in rent?
John Case: So, if you are looking at the year-to-date, I guess that's in our supplement as where you're getting that information on Page 24, for everyone re-leasing to new tenants, with and without vacancy you're seeing a 30% low down in rents. The issue there is simply, those are -- that's the market, I mean we're also disappointed that it's not higher overall our re-leasing spreads are positive at a -- just under 103%. We've executed more than 1,900 lease rollovers in the Company's history and have a lot of experience at this the majority of the assets that we do re-lease are re-leased at a positive spread and year-to-date 105% of expiring rents to the same tenant.
Ross Nussbaum: Where -- maybe the follow-up is if I looked at the entire portfolio today, do you have a sense of what the market-to-market is on the entire portfolio?
John Case: With regards with rents?
Ross Nussbaum: Yes.
John Case: Yes I mean there you can see it that we're roughly at market rents, it's slightly on the entire portfolio just slightly above. So, there's not a very big differencial between our contractual rents and market rents.
Ross Nussbaum: Second question I had is on the Walgreens acquisition, I know there's not too much you can say, but if I extrapolate based on the cap rate of the Life Time Fitness deal and the average cap rate which you bought properties, it would suggest that the Walgreens pricing was close to 6 or could it have been below, I guess my question would be why does it makes sense at this point in the cycle when the private market -- the 1031 market is going bananas. Why pay up for the creme de la creme corner Walgreens location -- why is that the transaction that makes sense versus perhaps stepping a little further down the credit curve, or just passing on that opportunity completely?
John Case: Yes well, that was a well structured transaction for us and I can't go into details on it, but it looks certainly more favourable than what you see in the 1031 market. And that's an industry and a tenant that we like a lot, you've heard us discuss quite a bit given what's happening in the healthcare industry and with our ageing population and the performance of that company. So, it was an attractive investment and I would say this, we don't do large institutional sale lease back transactions without rental rate growth. [Multiple speakers] In the private market, 1031market it's back as you alluded to and we're seeing quite pricing there at the 5% area. We've even seen some four handles there, so, there is a certainly premium for the one offs that don't necessarily exist for the larger portfolios and then certainly a relationship element to our business with them as well.
Operator: We will go next to Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.
Chris Lucas: John, just a follow-up question on the comments you just about sort of the intensity or the competitiveness of the 1031 market just wondering does it make sense to sort of start ramping up your disposition program to take advantage of some of that arbitrage?
John Case: What we are seeing now is we have been in a period for a while where there has been a portfolio premium where people were teaming to get more capital out the door. That pricing has not become less expensive what's happened is the banks have returned to the market for the one off and the smaller portfolios and are lending quite aggressively. So you’ve seen that 1031 market pricing surge and they are fairly equivalent across the board there is very few opportunities as the one that I just described where the arb there is more significant. But we don’t want to sell properties and we don’t want to own long-term and so we're not seeing enough of an arb yet to crank crest back up. But it's something we look at every quarter so that’s a good question.
Chris Lucas: And then just for you or for Paul just sitting where we are today with the capital market conditions as they are. If you had to make a decision about raising equity a bit more long-term unsecured debt which -- would you have a preference for either under the current conditions?
John Case: We'd be comfortable with either given the strength of the balance sheet and the pricing of both yes we’d be comfortable with either right now.
Chris Lucas: And then maybe a little more detailed question on the term facility, Paul is there flexibility or ease that the capital markets present every opportunity to easily prepay that and replace it with some more permanent capital?
Paul Meurer: Yes it is fully pre payable without penalty at any time.
Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income’s conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.
John Case: Thanks Ricky and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you this fall at the various conferences and we hope everyone has a great end to their summer. Thanks again.
Operator: That does conclude today’s conference. We thank you for your participation.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-04-30 14:30:00) =====
Executives: Janeen Bedard - Vice President, Administration Executive Department John Case - Chief Executive Officer Sumit Roy - Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer Paul Meurer - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer
Analysts: Nick Joseph - Citigroup Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley Collin Mings - Raymond James Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets Dan Donlan - Ladenburg Thalmann Chris Lucas - Capital One Securities
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Realty Income First Quarter 2015 Operating Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Janeen Bedard: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's First Quarter 2015 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.
John Case: Thanks, Janeen and welcome to our call today. We're pleased with our first quarter results with AFFO per share increasing by 4.7% to record quarterly amount of $0.67. As announced in yesterday's press release we are reiterating our 2015 AFFO per share guidance of $2.66 to $2.71 as we continue to anticipate another solid year for earnings growth. We've had an active first four months of the year. We were added to the S&P 500 Index in April becoming the first net lease REIT to join this index. In January we were added to the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index as a result of increasing our dividend every year for 20 consecutive years. In addition we raised 379 million in equity capital at an attractive cost to fund our acquisitions activity. Now I will hand it over to Paul to provide an overview of our financial results. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks John. As usual, I will comment and provide brief highlights regarding our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 11.4% for the quarter; this increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at March 31st was approximately $936 million. On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $58.5 million. This increase was primarily due to our two recent bond offerings, the $350 million 10 year notes we issued last June and $250 million 12 year notes issued in September. We also recognized a non-cash $1.1 million loss on interest rate swaps during the quarter. On a related note our coverage ratios, both remained strong with interest coverage at 3.9 times and fix charge coverage at 3.4 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses were approximately $12.9 million for the quarter, essentially unchanged from the prior year. Included in G&A expenses approximately $94,000 in acquisition cost. Our G&A as a percentage of total rental and other revenues is only 5.4% and our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 remains the same at approximately $55 million. Property expenses which were not reimbursed by tenants totaled $4 million for the quarter. Our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 remained approximately $20 million. Provisions for impairment of approximately $2.1 million during the quarter includes impairments we recorded on one sold property, one property classified as held for sale and one property where the building was replaced. Gain on sales were approximately $7.2 million in the quarter and just a reminder as always we do not include property sales gained in our FFO or in our AFFO. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.68 for the quarter a 4.6% increase versus a year ago and adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.67 per share for the quarter a 4.7% increase versus a year ago. Dividends paid increased 2.6% in Q1 and we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.274 per share. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we've continued to maintain a conservative and safe capital structure. As you know in early April we raised approximately 276 million of new equity capital in conjunction to the S&P 500 Index. The index inclusion was an excellent opportunity to raise capital at a very lost by offering shares to the index fund needing to buy stock on that specific day. Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rate and continued to be rated BAA1 BBB+ at a weighted average maturity of seven years. Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had a $370 million balance at March 31st. After the equity offering and our acquisition activity in April the facility balance today is approximately $400 million. We did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some at maturity so our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter end decreased to approximately $785 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure to rising interest rates that we have is on just $15.5 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $68 million of mortgages and $150 million of bonds coming due in 2015 and our maturity schedule as well later thereafter. Currently our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 29% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt to EBITDA at quarter end was approximately 5.7 times. Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on the quarter.
John Case: Thanks Paul. I’ll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to perform well. Occupancy base on a number of properties was 98% a 40 basis points decline from last quarter. At the end of the quarter we had 86 properties held for lease out of nearly 4,400 properties in our portfolio. Economic occupancy was 99.1% a 10 basis points decline from last quarter and a 10 basis points improvement year-over-year. Occupancy based on square footage was 98.7%. We had a number of properties come off lease during the first quarter which impacted primarily our physical occupancy. Our leasing team will continue to address these properties as part of our standard portfolio management process. We continue to expect our occupancy to remain around 98% through 2015. Of the 43 properties we re-leased during the quarter 30 were leased to existing tenants and 13 were leased to new tenants, recapturing 99.2% of expiring rents. Additionally five vacant properties were sold during the quarter. Our same store rent increased 1.4% during the quarter. The industry is contributing most to our quarterly same-store rent growth for convenience stores, health and fitness and quick service restaurants. We expect same-store rent growth to remain about 1.4% for the foreseeable future. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type. At the end of the first quarter, our properties were leased to 236 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states and Puerto Rico. 78% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial and distribution properties at 11%. Our diversification contributes to the predictability of our cash flow. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. Today more than 90% of our retail revenue comes from businesses with these characteristic which better positions them to successfully operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete with ecommerce. At the end of the first quarter, our top 20 tenants represented 54% of rental revenue. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. With Circle K's acquisition of the Pantry, two of our top 20 tenants consolidated into one allowing the U.S. government to enter our top 20 at 1.2% of rent. Now 10 of our top 20 tenants have investment grade credit ratings but rental revenues from these 10 investment grade rated tenants represent 60% of the rent from our top 20 tenants. Within our portfolio no single tenant accounts for more than 5.5% of rental revenue so diversification by tenant remains favorable. Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.5% of rental revenue that actually remains our second largest tenant at 5.2% of rental revenue. Drugstores and convenience stores are our two largest industries each at 9.6% of rental revenue. Drugstore is about 10 basis points from last quarter while convenience stores are down 20 basis points from last quarter. Our third largest industry is Dollar stores at 9.3% down 20 basis points from last quarter. As many of you know, Dollar Tree is expected to close its acquisition of Family Dollar later in the second quarter. The FTC has substantially completed its review of the acquisition and identified 340 of the combined 14,000 stores for divestiture. We continued to expect no financial impact on our rental revenue given the minimal portfolio overlap that our Family Dollar locations have with Dollar Tree and the long leased durations of our locations. We continued to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 48% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. This revenue percentage is up from 46% at the end of 2014 primarily as a result of Couche-Tard's acquisition of the Pantry converting the Pantry our former 15th largest tenant from non-investment grade to investment grade status. However, this percentage should move down a bit to the mid-40s later in the second quarter as a result of Dollar Tree’s pending acquisition of Family Dollar. In addition to tenant credit, the store level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. Our weighted average coverage ratio on our retail properties was 2.6 times on a four wall basis, and importantly the medium is also 2.6 times. Moving on to acquisitions, we continue to see a very high volume of acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced about 9.5 billion in acquisition opportunities and completed 210 million at a cash cap rate of 6.9%. So we remain selective in our investment strategy. There continues to be a lot of capital pursuing these transactions and we continue to see cap rates check down a bit for the higher quality properties we're pursuing. However our investments spreads relative to our cost of capital continue to be quite attractive. Subsequent to the first quarter end we closed an additional 302 million in acquisitions bringing us to a total of 512 million in acquisitions for the first four months of the year. We expect acquisitions volume for 2015 to be at the high end of our previous acquisitions guidance range of 700 million to 1 billion given what we’re seeing today. We continue to selectively sell assets and redeploy that capital and to properties that better fit our investment strategy. During the quarter, we sold nine properties for $22.1 million. We continued to anticipate dispositions to be around 50 million for 2015. I’ll hand it over to Sumit to discuss our acquisitions and dispositions in more detail now. Sumit?
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John. We are in the first quarter of 2015, we invested 2010 million in 83 properties, approximately 2.5 million per property located in 24 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 6.9% and the weighted average lease term of 15.5 years. As a reminder, our initial cap rates or cash are not GAAP which tend to be higher due to straight lining of rent. We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property including all expenses borne by Realty Income. On a revenue basis, 60% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants and the rest of the revenues are from retail tenants that are non-investment grade or not rated. 74% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 26% are from industrial and distribution assets. These assets are leased to 15 different tenants in 12 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our diversified industrial, quick service restaurants and automotive services. Of the nine independent transactions closed in the first quarter only one transaction was about 50 million. Transaction still continues to remain healthy, resource more than 9 billion in the first quarter. Of these opportunities, 54% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 46% or approximately 4 billion were one-off assets.  Investment grade opportunities represented 55% for the first quarter. Of the $210 million in acquisitions closed in the first quarter, approximately 41% were one-off transactions. 94% of the transactions closed were relationship driven. We remained selective and disciplined in our investment approach closing on less than 3% of deals sourced and continued to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 46 year operating history. As to pricing, cap rates continued to remain tight in the first quarter with investment grade properties trading from low 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. As John highlighted, our disposition activities remained active. During the quarter, we sold nine properties with 22 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.7% and realized an unlevered internal rate of return of over 12.5%.  Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy averaging 248 basis points in the first quarter which was significantly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. In conclusion, the first quarter investments remained solid at 210 million while sourcing more than 9 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above our historical level as a tight cap rate environment in the first quarter was more than offset by our improving cost of capital. We remain selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We continue to seek advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we believe that our acquisitions for 2015 will be at the high end of our previous acquisitions guidance range of 700 million to 1 billion. With that I’d like to hand it back to John.
John Case: Thanks Sumit. Our activities continued to result in healthy per share earnings growth which supports the payment of the liable monthly dividends that increase over time. We increased the dividend this quarter by 2.6%. We’ve increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of almost 5%. Our payout ratio in the first quarter was 83.7% which is a level we continue to be comfortable with.  Finally to wrap it up, we’re pleased with the results for the quarter and with the investment opportunities we continue to see in the acquisitions market We remain well positioned to execute on acquisitions with approximately 1.1 billion available on the credit facility today. Our cost of capital advantage continues to support our ability to drive healthy earnings accretion for our shareholders. At this time, I would like to open it up for questions, Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We’ll take our first question today from Nick Joseph from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Nick Joseph: I am wondering if you expect any impact to your portfolio from Walgreens’ announcement of the 200 store closings.
John Case: Nick this is John here. I think that Walgreens is looking at closing 200 underperforming stores while at the same time opening up 200 new stores. Our average lease term with Walgreens is 14 years and we have good performing stores we only have about five coming due in the next three or four years and those are all strong performers. If they were to close one of our stores of course they would be responsible for paying rent through the term of the lease. But we’re not expecting any impact from that at all. We continue to like that business quite a bit as you know.
Nick Joseph: And then in terms of the updated guidance at least that acquisitions trending towards the high end, can you update us on the capital plan for the remainder of the year given where the balance sheet is today?
John Case: So it will be a function of where we are on acquisitions for the remainder of the year. We have front loaded our equity a fair amount this year as you know partly as a result of the S&P inclusion, so we've raised 379 million in equity to date I would see over the balance of the year we’ll tend to go in the direction of fixed income markets but we’ll look at both equity and debt markets and determine at the appropriate time what makes the most sense for the company from a funding perspective. But given where we are with the balance sheet and what we’ve done year-to-date we’ve got a lot of flexibility there.
Operator: Our next question will come from Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra: I was just wondering if you could give us the cap rate, the overall cap rate on the acquisitions I think was 6, 7 if you could break that out between the retail and the industrial assets?
John Case: Sure. Sumit, do you want to handle that.
Sumit Roy: So on the industrial side, the cap rate was in the low 6 zip code and on the retail side it was in the very low 7, just right above 7 so blended that was 6, 7 on the acquisitions.
Vikram Malhotra: And then on the additional assets that you bought subsequent to the quarter, could you just give us some more color as to maybe just high level which sectors or what type of asset they were?
John Case: We will release the details on those acquisitions on our second quarter earnings call in July as we typically do. What we can say is that it was principally attributable to a large sale leaseback transaction with an existing tenant. And we're have limited in terms of what we can say about it at this time. We thought it would be helpful to disclose amount in April to put context along with our guidance for the year in terms of acquisitions.
Vikram Malhotra: And then just looking at the investment grade exposure overall, I am sure it’s every quarter things can move around. But just high level it seems like that percentage has maybe creeped up the last few quarters. I am just kind of wondering if you just have a sort of governor in some sense I mean you’re close to 48% now, where do you think that number could go over the next year or so.
John Case: We’re comfortable at 48%. We don’t have a litmus test or a target. We execute both the non-investment grade and investment grade transactions that are investment strategy within our investment parameters. I will say that as a result of the Dollar Tree acquisition of Family Dollar you will see the investment grade percentage tick down to the mid-40 to probably be around 44% at the end of the quarter because Family Dollar will go from investment grade to non-investment grade. But I think it will remain in the 40s and generally the mid-upper 40s for the remainder of the year. I don’t think it will change substantially. We’re happy with the credit profile of the portfolio and again we’ll execute both the non-investment grade and investment grade opportunities that make sense for us. So that at this point driven by the opportunities we’re seeing in the marketplace.
Vikram Malhotra: And then just last one obviously I know it’s very small percentage of the portfolio that will come up for re-leasing. But just have you seen any of the tenants or any desire to maybe move down in terms of whenever renewals come-up?
John Case: Typically the renewals are for the existing tenants around five years and for new tenants about seven years, that’s held strong for last five, ten years and we’re not really getting much feedback that that’s changing. So we’re not seeing much pressure for shorter lease terms nor we able to extend those lease terms much further into the future than five and seven years.
Operator: Our next question will come from Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Collin Mings: Just a couple of questions here, first, you guys provide maybe an update on where the watch list stand I think last quarter you referenced it maybe 1.5% of revenues, any changes to that, any changes in the composition?
John Case: It’s 1.2% of revenues today. It’s about a 150 million in properties. There is a fair amount of casual dining and child daycare on that. This really hasn’t changed substantially since the last quarter.
Collin Mings: And then as far as the acquisition is completed year-to-date but at least during the 1Q, can you may be talk about the breakout between rent bumps and what you’re getting for the investment grade versus non-investment grade.
John Case: Yes, it’s pretty much in line with what they’ve done historically. On investment grade overall they’re averaging around 1%. On the non-investment grade they are around 1.7% somewhere around there. So not much of the change in terms of rent growth from the acquisitions we did in the first quarter versus what we’ve done over the last few years.
Collin Mings: And then maybe just remind us just bigger picture here John, as you think about where assets trading right now relative to replacement cost. I think in the past you’ve highlighted some of the deals that are getting out there. These assets are trading well above replacement cost. I mean how does that look in the current environment and how much of a consideration is that if you’re thinking about the different deals that are coming across your desk.
John Case: It’s a significant consideration for us. When we have 9.5 billion of acquisition opportunities like we did in the first quarter yet we execute 210 million, we’re being very selective and a lot of that is driven by structures and pricing that is being given by the markets of these sellers that we’re not willing to match. And that that certainly includes a fair amount of not only rents that are well above market but also replacement cost that are sometimes 150% to 200% pricing of replacement costs 150% to 200%. So there's some pretty aggressive structure in getting done and that’s while you see us continue to be quite selective.
Collin Mings: And then just maybe one last one from me, this goes back talking about the deals that are relationship driven I think in the past you’ve suggested maybe 20, 25 basis point greater yield than some of the non-relationships deals. Does that spread still hold true? And then is there any differential between some of the retail and non-retail assets when you think about that maybe 25 basis points advantage you get.
John Case: It’s really up to 20 basis points or so and we don’t see a difference between the retail and the industrial assets. It holds true for both classes of assets.
Operator: Our next question will come from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: If you were to rank the factors that are contributing to driving cap rate lower I guess across all the property types in that lease other than low interest rates, would your competitors are signing value too? We’re certainly familiar with what’s important in realty incomes portfolio but how are competitors thinking about this space, are they’re looking at the investment grade tenants the lease duration, what’s contributing to that to make net lease a lot prominent than it once was.
John Case: Yes, it’s really all over the place but the reason it’s so competitive today Todd because of the function of the yields offered and that’s clearly driven by the interest rates and alterative investments, but we see a lot of players work in this space five years ago coming at and aggressively buying assets. And in some cases I would say that there is not a lot of discipline on some of the acquisitions we see done away from us. So there seems to be an aggressive search for yield.
Todd Stender: And how about large deals you’re looking at certainly are comps for your guys, you go back to ARCT in inland, I think you highlighted that the stuff you've already acquired in Q2 as a portfolio. What do the portfolio premiums look like, how does that kind of compare to historically divest and maybe in the last two to three years.
John Case: Well, we've seen really an evaporation of the portfolio premium because of resurgence in the 1031 market and lenders lending to that buyer class. So we’ve seen the cap rates on the one-off transactions reach the cap rate that we were seeing on the portfolios and in some cases some asset classes that are even more aggressive. So we're seeing may be the beginning of a reversal where the art is from portfolio to on-off transactions. But that clearly today is non-premium pricing for you know portfolio transactions of several hundred million.
Operator: We will take the next question from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Rich Moore: First thing on other revenue, Paul, that was up and I am curious what I guess that was and then what happens going forward?
Paul Meurer: You know it's a typical number I think that it's best to be modeled not a zero as recommended in the past, right, because it's a active portfolio, it's large and you know we actively manage this such that you're going to find income there periodically from easements, proceeds from insurance situations on properties, takings, main takings of may be a small piece of land from an investment, interest income, so it's kind of a mismatch that you're going to have some level of a run rate there. And then the reason was a little bit larger in this particular quarter was a whole back of some funds that we had set aside in an acquisition that was returned to us in the first quarter that the tenant did not need for some tenant improvements they had planned to do in a property that we were acquiring towards the end of last year. So that pops it up a little bit more than usual.
Rich Moore: So you did like 3 million last year so if you do you know 3 million to 4 million this year that’s kind of a reasonable number.
Paul Meurer: That feels about right, that's correct. And I wouldn’t annualize the number you are looking at here in this first quarter because it did have one unusual $400,000 item in it but otherwise you're going to have some income in that line item every quarter.
Rich Moore: And then John, you talked last quarter about, on your development plans about wanting to grow your built-to-suit portfolio and receive a couple of hundred million annually and I think it's a little bit larger this quarter than it was, I mean what if you added you know what are you working and do you still growing it to a fairly substantial size as reality?
John Case: Yeah, well you know we're pleased that we've been able to raise it to just under 75 million at the end of the quarter. We continue to look for opportunities to continue to grow that and given the returns we have on those investments and the higher yields. So we're looking at industrial properties and retail sort of a balance of the two and you know good lease terms and cap rates that are in excess of 9% versus closer to 7% high 6% on the straight acquisition side.
Rich Moore: So what would be annual?
John Case: We would like to see that thing. What's that?
Rich Moore: Sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt you.
John Case: No, I was just going to say we would like to continue to grow that -- as the year goes on.
Rich Moore: So what kinds of things did you add, do you have any examples of the sorts of projects you are working on?
John Case: Yes, in industrial we had a number of expansions with FedEx, you know we had a large retail discount store that’s a ground up development that we started as well. So it's pretty representative of the portfolio.
Operator: Our next question will come from Dan Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.
Dan Donlan: John I was wondering if you could talk a little about Page 16 of the supplemental, just looking at the fix charge coverage ratios that you guys gave there, what percentage of the portfolio, looks like it's 2.6 average EBITDA to rent ratio, what percentage of the portfolio does that represent?
John Case: The 2.6?
Dan Donlan: Yes sir.
John Case: Yes it represents the retail portfolio; we got sales and P&Ls on about 65% of the retail tenant. Most of the balance that we don’t get those on are investment grade tenants.
Dan Donlan: That was going to be my next question, what percentage of the non-investment grade do you not get in on, it sounds like it might be basically nothing.
John Case: Yes, very, very small.
Dan Donlan: And then that is a, that's a four wall coverage, could you may be guesstimate what you think you might be if included you know may be corporate overhead?
John Case: Yes I mean it would probably see may be 2 to 3 somewhere in there, for G&A.
Dan Donlan: And then I guess for Paul, just kind of making sure the, just so I understand the balance sheet, is the CIP that you guys have, is that, is that roll through in the other assets line item?
Paul Meurer: Yes it does.
Dan Donlan: And then just kind of curious as to your thoughts on may be doing some 30 year paper, I know you've done it before in the past are you guys open to that, is that market attractive, is it open to you guys?
Paul Meurer: It’s certainly open and I would say as a general comment it’s always something of interest longer term, given that we like the match fund longer term with our liabilities versus as you know our long-term asset. So it’s really just a function of how it feels and worth price in a times, it’s very aggressive and is very, very compelling. So it’s something we would always consider. You may recall that last time we did it, it really was the result of a reverse increase from the life company who specifically reached out to us wanting to place third year paper with us and then we surrounded that with some other investors to create a natural trade at that time. But it’s something we will look at each and every time when we consider typically for us long-term fixed rate liability.
Dan Donlan: And then just kind of maybe bigger picture I guess John or Sumit, what are you seeing from retailers or companies that have large real-estate, exposure on their books maybe they’re getting pressure from the investors to monetize. Do you see that continue to play out, is there other potential transactions out there that aren't so large that you think you can take down and what’s your appetite for this type of deals on a going forward basis.
John Case: Those [spots] continue to multiply and their discussions going on, we can’t go into particulars on those but we would expect to have a couple of opportunities over the next year or two. These things take a long-time. The companies that we’re talking to that we’ve been talking to about this concept for a multiple years but it really seems to be gaining momentum with the activist investors coming in more pressure on some of the boards in management teams to more efficiently utilize their real-estate and potentially monetize it. So the number of discussions we always had these discussions, and say the number of these discussions and the seriousness of these discussions is both my much greater today. So we would expect to execute on something over the next year or two on that front.
Dan Donlan: And is there some type of high water mark from percentage of rent perspective that you just don’t want to go above or if you really, really like the deal are you okay with maybe increasing the tenants exposure to 10% of rents, how should we think about that?
John Case: I think we would be comfortable for the right tenant, right company, right transaction to go beyond the revenue percentage levels that we are at today. We are at 5.5% at Walgreens and then 9.6% in terms of industry. I could see industry and tenant going beyond that in the near-term and they we try to work our way back down to 10% plus or minus industry revenue exposure and mid single-digits in terms of tenant revenue exposure. So we really like that diversification it’s always been an important element of the story. We’ve never been more diversified than we are today but we would not turn in attractive transaction like that away for a period time to exceed those levels.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.
Chris Lucas: John, just kind of following up on a couple of earlier questions, really to the development program I guess could you remind us sort of how guys play there and how scalable your infrastructure is if you look to grow this and how you look to expand that program. So what roles are you playing in that process, is it just capital or there are other things that you’re providing here?
John Case: It’s a capital, we’re not acting as the developer, we have a relationship with the number of national development companies and we'll fund development or provide a take out. It’s always -- with the signed lease on hand. So there is no speculative development, so it’s really a capital function and I think because of that I think it’s quite scalable.
Chris Lucas: So, as it relates to the process development versus acquisitions, is there no more time spent on the development relative to the acquisition?
John Case: No, there is more time spent by our team. We got to monitor the development process. We work with outside advisors in terms of monitoring the construction and development and then we have our own team and our own people also involved in that. So there is more time, more effort from the management team from our team here in San Diego on development properties versus acquisitions generally speaking.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen that concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income’s conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks. Thanks Elisabeth and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today’s conference. And we thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q4  (2015-02-18 16:30:00) =====

Analysts: Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Todd Stender – Wells Fargo Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets Vikram Malhotra – Morgan Stanley Nicholas Joseph – Citigroup Cedric Lachance – Green Street Advisors Todd Lukasik – Morningstar
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Realty Income Fourth Quarter 2014 Operating Results Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I’d like to turn the conference over to Ms. Janeen Bedard. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Janeen Bedard: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income’s Fourth Quarter 2014 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-K. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.
John Case: Thanks, Janeen, welcome to our call today. We're pleased with our fourth quarter results with AFFO per share increasing by 4.8% to $0.65 and 2014 AFFO per share increasing by 6.6% to $2.57. As announced in yesterday’s press release, we are reiterating our 2015 AFFO per share guidance of $2.66 to $2.71 as we continue to anticipate another solid year of earnings growth. Paul will provide you with an overview of our financial results. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks, John. As usual, I will briefly comment on our financial statements and provide some highlights of our financial results for the quarter and the year starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 14.5% for the quarter and 19.6% for the year. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year, as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at December 31 was approximately $920 million. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased to $96.5 million in the quarter, as depreciation expenses obviously increased with our portfolio growth. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $59.1 million. This increase was primarily due to our two recent bond offerings, the $350 million tenure notes we issued in June and a $250 million 12 year notes issued in September.  On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong with interest coverage of 3.8 times and fixed charge coverage of 3.4 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses were approximately $15.6 million for the quarter, and $51.1 million for the year, both were decreases from last year, due to lower acquisition transaction costs, as well as lower stock compensation cost.  Overall, our total G&A in 2014 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues represented only 5.7% of revenues. Our projection for G&A expenses in 2015 is approximately $55 million or about 5.5% of revenue.  Property expenses which were not reimbursed by tenants totaled $4.2 million for the quarter and $16.8 million for the year. Our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 is approximately $20 million. Income taxes consist of income tax paid to various states and cities by the company and they were approximately $1.1 million for the quarter and $3.5 million for the year. Provisions for impairment of approximately $2 million during the quarter includes impairments we reported on one sold property and two properties held for sale at December 31. Note that approximately $510,000 of this impairment is recognized in discontinued operations on the income statement. An accounting treatment that is necessary because the property was held for sale at the end of last year when the discount accounting rules changed.  Gain on sales were approximately $25 million in the quarter and $42 million for the year and just a reminder, as always we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.64 for the quarter, a 4.9% increase versus a year ago and $2.58 for the year, a 7.1% increase over 2013. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution and dividends was $0.65 per share for the quarter, a 4.8% increase versus the year ago and came in at $2.57 for the year, a 6.6% increase over 2013. Dividends paid increased 2.1% in 2014 and as previously announced last month we declared a 3% increase to our cash monthly dividend which was paid to shareholders this month. Our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.268 per share. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we’ve continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. As previously disclosed, we regained our $220 million of preferred e-stock, which had a coupon of $6.75% back in October. Recall it in mid-September, we issued $250 million of 12-year bond prized at a yield of 4.178% to pre-fund this preferred redemption. This transaction overall resulted in annual cash expense savings of almost $5.7 million. Obviously, we are pleased with our continued access to low cost long term capital in the bond market. Our bonds which are all unsecured in fixed rate and continue to be rated Baa1 BBB+ have a weighted average maturing of 7.2 years. Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had a $223 million balance at December 31 and currently we have $382 million of borrowings on the line. We did not assume any mortgages during the quarter. We did pay off some of the maturity to our outstanding net mortgage that at year end decreased to approximately $836 million. Not including our credit facilities the only variable rate debt exposure to rising interest rates that we have is only just $39 million of this mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shaper with only 120 million to mortgages and 150 million of bonds coming due in 2015 and our maturity schedule as well laddered thereafter. Currently our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 30% and our preferred stock outstanding is less than 2.5% of our capital structure. And our debt to EBITDA at year end was only 5.8 times.  Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background.
John Case: Thanks, Paul. I’ll begin with an overview of the portfolio, which is performing well and continues to generate a tenable cash flow for our shareholders. Occupancy increased 10 basis points from last quarter and 20 basis points year-over-year to 98.4% based on the number of properties with 70 properties available for lease out of over 4,300 properties in our portfolio. This is the highest our occupancy has been since 2007. Occupancy based on square footage was 99.2%, a 10 basis points improvement from last quarter and 20 basis points year-over-year. Economic occupancy was also 99.2%, a 10 basis points improvement from both last quarter and year-over-year. 2014 has been one of our most active years every for lease rollover activity with leases expiring on 220 properties. Of these properties, we released 173 to existing tenants and 30 to new tenants, recapturing 99.3% of expiring rents on the properties that were released. In addition, we sold 17 vacant properties during the year. In the fourth quarter we experienced 54 lease rollovers, of these we released 40 to existing tenants and 10 to new tenants recapturing approximately 97% of expiring rents on the properties that were released. Eight vacant properties were sold during the fourth quarter. Our same store rent increased 1.7% during the quarter and 1.5% in 2014. The industry is contributing most to our quarterly same store rent growth or convenient stores, health and fitness, and quick service restaurants. We expect same store rent growth to remain at about 1.5% for the foreseeable future. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant, industry, geography, and to a certain extent property type. At the end of the fourth quarter, our properties released 234 commercial tenants in 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 79% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties, while 21% is from non-retail properties, the largest component being industrial and distribution. This diversification continues to enhance the predictability of our cash flow. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with the service, non-discretionary and/or a low price point component to their business. Today, more than 90% of our retail revenues come from businesses with these characteristics, which better position them to successfully operate in all economic environments and to compete with e-commerce. At the end of the fourth quarter, our top 10 and top 20 tenants represented 37% and 53% of rental revenue respectively. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. There were no changes to the composition of our tenants in our top 25 since last quarter. Nine of the top 20 tenants have investment grade credit rating. The rental revenue from these non-investment grade rated tenants represents over half of the rent from our top 20 tenants. Within our portfolio, no single tenant accounts for more than 5.4% of our rental revenue. The diversification by tenant remains favorable.  Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.4% of rental revenue, unchanged from last quarter. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 5.1% of rental revenue, which is also unchanged from last quarter. Convenience stores remain our largest industry at 9.8% of rental revenue, down 20 basis points from last quarter. Our second largest industry is Dollar stores at 9.5%, down 10 basis points from last quarter. As many of you know, the competition between Dollar Tree and Dollar General to purchase Family Dollar recently ended with Family Dollar shareholders approving the merger with Dollar Tree. Family Dollar is our fifth largest tenant at 4.5% of rental revenues. We view this outcome as an incremental positive given the minimal portfolio overlap Family Dollar has with Dollar Tree and there will be no impact on our tenant diversification metrics. The FTC [ph] is currently reviewing the merger, but we remain confident that the performance and long lease duration of our Family Dollar locations should ensure that the divestitures have no impact on our rental revenue. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 46% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. Again, we define an investment grade rated company that’s having an investment grade rating by one or more of the three major rating agencies. This revenue percentage is up from 40% a year ago. We continue to generate solid rental growth from these investment grade tenants. Nearly 70% of our investment grade leases as a percentage of rental revenues have rental rate increases in them which average approximately 1.4% annually, which is consistent with our historical portfolio of rental growth rate. Overall, investment grade tenant rental growth is about 1%. In addition to tenant credit, the store level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. Our weighted average rent coverage ratio on our retail properties is 2.6 times on a four wall basis, and importantly the median is 2.7 times. Moving on to acquisitions, we continue to see a very high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced nearly 4 billion in acquisition opportunities and for the year we sourced 24 billion, making this our second most active year ever for sourced transaction. There continues to be a lot of capital to pursuing these transactions and we continue to remain selective in our investment strategy, investing at attractive risk adjusted returns and investment spreads for our shareholders.  During the quarter, we completed $158 million in property level acquisitions at a cash cap rate of 7.1%, bringing us to $1.4 billion in acquisitions for the year at an initial cash cap rate of 7.1% as well. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital continues to be well above our historical average. Today, we are investing at spreads over 250 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital. Given the active environment we’re seeing, we are raising our 2015 acquisitions guidance. We now expect acquisitions volume of $700 million to $1 billion, an increase from our initial acquisitions guidance for the year of $500 million to $800 million.  As expected, we had a very active quarter for dispositions as we sold 18 properties for $53 million during the fourth quarter. During the year, we sold 46 properties for $107 million more than double our initial expectation of $50 million at the beginning of the year. And we are again reiterating our initial disposition guidance for 2015 of approximately $50 million. Now, let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss in more detail our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit?
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we invested $158 million in 82 properties, approximately $1.9 million per property located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.6 years. As a reminder, our initial cash cap rates or cash not GAAP which tend to be higher due to straight lining of rent.  We define cash cap rates as contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property including all expenses borne by Realty Income. On a revenue basis, 32% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants and 68% of the revenues are from non-investment grade retail tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail, and 13% are from industrial and distribution. These assets are leased to 23 different tenants in 19 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented our quick service restaurants, grocery stores and drugstores. For the year 2014, we invested $1.4 billion in 506 properties which equates to approximately $2.8 million of properties located in 42 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with the weighted average lease term of 12.8 years. Of the total amount, approximately $434 million was invested in non-investment grade retail properties. On a revenue basis, 66% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail, 8% are from industrial, distribution and manufacturing, and 6% are from office. These assets are leased to 62 different tenants in 32 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are Dollar stores, home improvement and drugstores. Of the 80 independent transactions closed in 2014, only three transactions were above $50 million. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced approximately $4 billion in the fourth quarter. For 2014, we have sourced more than $24 billion in potential transaction opportunities. 2014 was the year with the second largest volume sourced in our company's history. Of these opportunities, 82% of the volume sourced were portfolios and 18% or approximately $5 billion were one-off assets.  Investment grade opportunities represented 49% for the fourth quarter. Of the $158 million in acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, approximately 33% were one-off transactions. 88% of the transactions closed in the fourth quarter were relationship driven. We remained selective and disciplined in our investment approach closing on less than 6% of deals sourced and continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our extended operating history. As to pricing, cap rates remained tight in the fourth quarter with investment grade properties trading from low 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from high 5% to low 8% cap rate range. As John highlighted, our disposition activities remained active. During the quarter, we sold 18 properties for $53.4 million at a net cash cap rate of 5.7% and realized an unlevered IRR of just over 12%. For 2014, we sold 46 properties for $106.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.9% and realized an unlevered IRR of 11.6%. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy averaging 211 basis points in the fourth quarter and 195 basis points in 2014, which were significantly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spread as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. In conclusion, the fourth quarter investments remained solid at $158 million. For the year 2014, we invested $1.4 billion while sourcing more than $24 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above our historical level as a tight cap rate environment in the fourth quarter was more than offset by improving cost of capital. We continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters.  We also took advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. As John mentioned, we are raising our acquisition guidance for 2015 from $500 million to $800 million to $700 million to $1 billion. With that, I would like to hand it back to John.
John Case: Thanks, Sumit. We continue to generate healthy per share earnings growth while maintaining a conservative capital structure. Our fourth quarter FFO and AFFO per share of $0.64 and $0.65 represented increases of 4.9% and 4.8% respectively from a year ago. Our 2014 FFO and AFFO per share of $2.58 and $2.57 represented increases of 7.1% and 6.6% respectively from a year ago. We are reiterating our 2015 FFO per share guidance range of $2.67 to $2.72, an increase of 3.5% to 5.4% over 2014 FFO per share. As mentioned earlier, we are also reiterating our AFFO per share guidance of $2.66 to $2.71, an increase of 3.5% to 5.4% over 2014 per share figures. Our focus continues to be the payment of reliable monthly dividends that grow over time. We have increased our dividend every year since the company’s listing in 1994 growing the dividend at a compounded average annual rate of 4.7%.  Our track record was recognized last month with our addition to the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index, which measures the performance of companies in the S&P composite 1,500 that have increased their dividend every year for at least 20 consecutive years. We are one of only six REITs included in this index and we remain committed to consistent growth of the dividend. Our payout ratio was 84.5% based on the midpoint of our 2015 AFFO guidance which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. This compares similarly with our 2014 AFFO payout ratio of 85.3%. Finally to wrap it up, we are pleased with our performance for 2014 and we remain quite optimistic for 2015. As reflected in our increased acquisitions guidance, we continue to see healthy volumes of acquisition opportunities but we will remain selective and disciplined with our investment strategy. We remain well positioned to execute on opportunities with just over $1.1 billion available on the credit facility today. Additionally, our cost of capital advantage continues to support our ability to drive healthy earnings accretion for our shareholders. At this time, I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We’ll take our first question from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.
Juan Sanabria: Hi, good afternoon guys. Just a question on the strategy with regards to your industrial exposure, how should we be thinking about that either growing or staying the same as a percentage of the pie going forward and what kind of pricing are you seeing for those assets specifically? And is it really just to an investment grade focus on those types of assets?
John Case: Yeah. One, we continue to focus on exclusively investment grade industrial. And at the end of the year, last year we had about 14% of our acquisitions came from industrial and distribution. We are still predominantly retail, 86%. We are seeing a bit of cap rate compression in the marketplace and that includes industrial, but we are actively seeking Fortune 1000 tenants with investment grade ratings and mission critical or significant locations with investments at/around replacement cost, at/around long-term - at/around market rents with growth with the long-term lease. So that’s typically the profile of what we are seeing and cap rates for that product range from probably the mid 5s right now to the high 6s. But we will continue to do that, but it will represent a minority of our investment activity.
Juan Sanabria: Okay. Should it grow at a piece of a pie or kind of hold steady from the current levels?
John Case: Right now it’s holding steady and I think over the near to intermediate term, it will hold steady to grow at slight bit.
Juan Sanabria: Okay, thanks. And I just wanted to ask about the increase in your acquisitions guidance, is there anything in particular that drove that? Are you feeling or seeing more portfolio deals or is it more one-off relationship transactions? And just sort of tangential follow-up, I think you noted the fourth quarter had some quick service in restaurant deals. From memory, I think you guys have been a little bit cautious on casual dining restaurants. Any change of tact there may be with the lower oil price or is it just specific to those deals in the fourth quarter?
John Case: With regard to QSRs, we’ve been fine now for quite some time. This company started in 1969 with an investment in a Taco Bell and over the last five years we’ve invested $2.2 billion in non-investment grade retail where we are underwriting to four wall cash flow coverages, quality tenants, high traffic quality locations and we’ve never gotten away from that though. We supplemented it with the investment grade strategy but we continue to be very active. The most active we’ve been in our history over the last five years in buying on investment grade retail. So we will continue to do that going forward. As far as acquisitions guidance, the first part of your question, we’re seeing both more one-off and small portfolio sourcing opportunities as well as some larger portfolios. So the driver in our acquisitions guidance change has been more activity, continued brisk sourcing activity, it’s given us more confidence for the year and therefore we raised the midpoint of our acquisitions guidance by $200 million. I’ll add that we did not adjust our AFFO per share estimates because we believe this incremental activity will be more backend loaded and we’ll have more of an impact in 2016 and 2015.
Juan Sanabria: Thanks, John. Appreciate the color.
John Case: Okay. Thanks, Juan.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender: Hi, thanks guys. Just to get a sense of any trend that stick out for the $4 billion of sourced deals that you looked at in Q4, what was the mix of property types and any characteristics may be you can point to and was any of this located overseas maybe what your appetite is for international right now?
John Case: Yeah. So virtually all of it was domestic and 90% of it was retail properties. So that will give you a good overview of what the servicing activities look like. Sumit, do you have anything to add on that front?
Sumit Roy: No and there was a large portfolio that we saw that had some international assets there as well, but it was a very small piece of the pie, the $4 billion.
Todd Stender: Okay, that’s helpful. And just looking at the sources of capital right now, you tapped this stock purchase plan and DRIP I believe might be in there too for $100 million in the quarter, is this truly a capital source? Should we be thinking about your ability to may be tap a $100 million a quarter if your stock performs well?
John Case: Something we implemented about a year and a half ago, the waiver discount program and it’s been very successful for us. We did issue $100 million in the fourth quarter. We also get a little bit of activity on our DRIP as well. Going forward, it’s something that we will opportunistically access. It’s an efficient way for us to raise equity, the cost of that equity is about 1.3% versus a little over 6% for a regular way offering. So it’s cheaper for the company and it allows us to match fund some of our acquisition activity. So we will continue to utilize it where it makes sense in the future, but we also won’t abandon regular or equity offerings.
Todd Stender: Is there an authorization for that John or is there a limit of how much you can do or does the board weigh in on how much they want to issue?
John Case: Yeah. The board has to authorize it and may have – and we have authorization of up to 6 million shares which should last us for a while.
Todd Stender: Okay, that’s helpful. And I may have missed this getting on late, but what’s holding it back from increasing your guidance given the $200 million increase in your acquisition guidance?
John Case: Yeah. I was just talking to Juan about that. It’s really timely. The incremental acquisitions we believe will close late in latter part of 2015 so they will have an greater impact on our 2016 AFFO and FFO versus 2015. So we felt comfortable leaving our guidance where it is.
Todd Stender: Great. Thank you.
John Case: Thanks, Todd.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard Moore: Hi, good afternoon or may be good morning guys. I’m curious on the line of credit, you guys added $150 million, was that just to pay off mortgages that came due? Is that what that was?
Paul Meurer: No, it will be…
Richard Moore: Since the end of the quarter, Paul?
Paul Meurer: What’s that? Since the end of the quarter, yeah. It would be primarily used for acquisitions during the first quarter.
Richard Moore: Okay. So that was $150 million of additional acquisitions. And do you have additional acquisitions under contract?
John Case: Yes, we do.
Richard Moore: Okay, great. Thanks. And then I was curious guys, the development and expansion properties I know it’s not terribly many but it look like you delivered nine in the quarter, do I read that right out of the supplemental? And then how do you think about these properties going forward with 2014, it seems that are left to although it get just finished and go away and you don’t have any more of these coming or do you do this periodically?
John Case: No, we’d like to maintain a fair amount of activity in that effort. The returns are about a 150 basis points higher in terms of initial yields and what we realize on acquisitions. Currently, we have $45 million in development underway of which we funded just over $12 million of that. About half of that is new development, about half of those assets are redevelopment and expansion of existing properties, but it’s been a very attractive business for us from a return standpoint. And we actually like to see that Rich grow to a couple of $100 million which we think is just fine on a balance sheet of our size, $16 billion in assets.
Richard Moore: Okay. Got it.
John Case: I’ll just say there will be a consistent theme of the business and continue.
Richard Moore: Okay, great. Thank you. So did you deliver $9 million in the quarter, is that right? Did I understand that correctly when I look at the supplemental?
John Case: Yeah. Sumit?
Sumit Roy: Yeah. Part of it is, we are constantly putting in redevelopment dollars. So at any given time, I think there were 23 assets for the quarter where we invested those $13 million. But in terms of actual delivery, those would only take into account new development and we don’t actually have that stat in front of us.
Richard Moore: Okay. So when you talk new development by the way you’re talking built-to-suits I assume?
Sumit Roy: That’s exactly right.
Richard Moore: Okay.
John Case: Yeah. I mean it’s important to note that all of the tenants in place and none of this is speculative development.
Richard Moore: Okay. Who are the kinds of tenants typically just out of curiosity?
John Case: It ranges from some of our health club tenants, our distribution sector tenants, some general merchandisers and a couple of theaters on the expansion and redevelopment side.
Richard Moore: Okay, great. Thank you very much guys.
John Case: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra: Thank you. Just a quick question on competition, some of your peers have mentioned more or increasing levels of competition from some of the non-traded folks over the last few months. Just wondering if you are seeing any incremental or may be even lower competition at the granular side and may be in the portfolios or may be at the portfolio side in terms of [indiscernible]?
John Case: Yeah. We’ve had one major player obviously step back from the market and they played at the granular level as well as on larger portfolio. So we are seeing a bit of an impact from that, but nothing too significant. What we’ve seen is more foreign institutional capital come into the market and really with greater debt we have seen return of the 1031 buyer. So the individual buyers are much more active today for granular assets and more aggressive than they were just a year ago. So some of what we’ve seen go away around the non-traders aren't quite as active as they were a year ago. It’s kind of been offset mostly but not entirely by the return of the 1031 buyer and more foreign institutional money coming into the sector on the higher quality properties.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. Thanks. And then just on your watch list, we’ve heard in the retail space in general whether it’s in strips or in malls, there have been some tenants that have been under pressure, some have closed stores. I’m just wondering if your watch list has changed in anyway perhaps by category or any tenant over the last quarter or so?
John Case: Not really. When you look at our watch list, you have a pretty healthy portion of that coming from two industries and that’s casual dining and child day care. Our watch list continues to represent about 1.5% of our revenues, it’s not that large. And as we watch those properties, we’ll make decisions whether to sell those leave them on the watch list or return them to the regular portfolio. So we haven’t really seen any changes in the composition. We’ll say that overall the tenant base continues to perform quite well. There is enough economic growth activity out there. The consumers are in better shape. We really by and large have no significant tenant issues right now. So they are as healthy as they’ve been in quite some time.
Vikram Malhotra: Okay. Thank you.
John Case: Thank you.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citigroup.
Nicholas Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate the color on the updated acquisition guidance. What this guidance assume for the cash cap rates and investment spreads for the 2015 acquisitions?
John Case: Yeah. The initial cash yields are right around 7% and on the investment spreads, we are assuming something consistent with what we did last year, so averaging right around 195 basis points.
Nicholas Joseph: Great. Thanks. And then across your portfolio, what do you expect the net impact of lower oil prices to be on your tenants?
John Case: Well, we are actually seeing a little of that. We had decent percentage rents in the last year in January and we are seeing the consumer with more disposable income stemming out. While we do own convenience stores, about 9.8% of our rental revenues are from convenience stores. They continue to perform well and inside sales have picked up which is where their margin is, and where they make most of their money. On gasoline sales, their profit is fairly fixed irrespective of price. So the same store portfolio continues to perform well. So we are seeing it, I think we’ll continue to see it as long as these prices hold where little extra money in the packets of consumers will help the Dollar Stores and the C-stores, some of these other areas.
Nicholas Joseph: Great. Thanks.
John Case: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we’ll go next to Cedric Lachance with Green Street Advisors.
Cedric Lachance: Thank you. When I look at your cap rates throughout the year in 2014, it remained relatively stable. They’ve always been around give or take 7% on the acquisitions. By contrast, the investment grade tenancy that were acquired in each quarter declined, so from 85% to 30% from the first quarter to last quarter. Would you say that you are purposefully trying to keep your initial yields around 7% and therefore are now willing to do more non-investment grade tenants or is it just a function of what was on the market during the year?
John Case: It’s a function of what’s on the market, which assets are offering the best risk adjusted returns. When you look at pricing, it’s not only impacted by investment grade or non-investment grade, it’s also impacted by how much development that we do in the period, what are the average lease terms. So you look at the fourth quarter, you will see lease terms that were longer than they were in the third quarter and that’s reflected in the cap rate. The longer lease terms are going to be at more aggressive cap rates. And then on the development side, it constituted more activity in the third quarter and that’s reflected – those are higher yields and that’s reflected in our average cap rate for the third quarter. So it’s really hard to sort of extrapolate trends there because the mix shifts each quarter. I think it’s better to look at the long-term trend and while we did see some cap rate compression last year and towards the end of the year, it slowed down, Cedric. So I think that 7% on average, it’s been right around there for the first part of 2015.
Cedric Lachance: Okay. So you talked about foreign capital entering the fray or being more interested in the higher quality properties. Have you thought about forming joint ventures with that capital in order to go after some of those lower yielding assets?
John Case: We haven’t approached any of them at this point. I think what you are seeing is a lot of capital looking for yield flowing into U.S. some of it’s coming into the sector and there is a fair amount of that capital deployed. So I am not sure that looking – these are well heeled sovereign wealth funds and other foreign institutions that don’t really need a capital partner.
Cedric Lachance: But they may need an operating partner or a partner that may identify acquisitions a lot better than they can, is there a role for you to play?
John Case: Yeah. Most of these are working through U.S. based institutional investment managers that run net lease money. So they bought these properties before they sourced and they identify them. So they are not working without a U.S. asset advisor and the fact that it’s not leased. They don’t feel that they need as much of an operating partner as they would if they were in a more actively managed portion of the real estate business. But it’s something that could make sense at some time.
Cedric Lachance: Okay. And then just a final question in regards to cost of capital, I think your investment spreads versus where you’ve able to invest historically are certainly at a high point or very close to high point. By contrast I’d say your acquisition guidance for 2015 is fairly conservative. Given that the spread is so wide or at least so wide as it is today, why not be a very aggressive buyer at this point in time and capture the benefit of that spreads in large numbers?
John Case: Our consistent theme has been to remain disciplined with regard to our investment strategy. And so we are really pursuing assets that fit our investment strategy. We are talking about 10, 15, 20 year leases and we want assets that are going to perform well over the long run, not necessarily just offering attractive spreads a day, potentially be an issue down the road. So we see transactions getting done that are aggressively structured from a pricing, coverage replacement cost, market rent standpoint and we are not going to chase those transactions because we think there is some risk in downside intermediate term and longer term to those types of transaction.  So we are really approaching it with a long-term view here and we think our investment strategy is something that will serve the company well over the long run. So clearly given our cost of capital advantage relative to the rest of the sector and our availability of capital, we could acquire a lot more than we’re acquiring. But again, we don’t want to deviate from the assets that make the most sense for us and we don’t want to get overly aggressive on the structures either.
Cedric Lachance: Okay. Thank you.
John Case: Thanks, Cedric.
Operator: And we’ll take our next question from Todd Lukasik with Morningstar.
Todd Lukasik: Hey, good afternoon guys. I just had a question on releasing activity and I’m assuming in the quarter and in the year that, that was all retail assets. I guess it looks like around 2018 you’ll start to see more of the non-retail assets up for renewal. I’m just wondering do you guys had any expectations at that time in terms of what will happen to releasing spread if you expect it to stay the same or may be go up or go down a little bit.
John Case: Well, we would expect the leasing spread to be similar to what we have in the existing portfolio maybe a little bit higher. We get to – in 2018 I think it is our first non-retail property role and I think that as we do our long-term planning, long-term budgeting, we are assuming a recapture rate of right around 100%. We would hope that it would be a little north of that Todd but we will see when we get there.
Todd Lukasik: Okay. And then just a question with the re-leasing to the new tenants, is it fair to assume that the majority of those leases that do end up going to new tenants are leases that are up for initial renewal as oppose to subsequent renewal or is that something that spread out across both of those?
John Case: It is a little bit weighted towards initial renewals, yeah.
Todd Lukasik: Okay.
John Case: That’s a good question, yeah.
Todd Lukasik: Okay, great. That’s all I have. Thanks.
John Case: Okay. Thanks, Todd.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to John Case for concluding remarks.
John Case: Thanks, Taylor, and thanks everyone for joining our call today. We look forward to speaking to you at some of these conferences coming up over the next few months. Have a good afternoon.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-10-30 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Janeen Bedard - Associate Vice President John Case - Chief Executive Officer Paul Meurer - Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Sumit Roy - Chief Operating Officer and CIO
Analysts: Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley Todd Lukasik - Morningstar 
Operator: Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2014 Operating Results Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Janeen Bedard, Associate Vice President. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Janeen Bedard: Thank you, operator. And thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income’s Third Quarter 2014 Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Investment Officer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Case.
John Case: Thanks, Janeen. And good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our call. We're pleased with our third quarter results with AFFO per share increasing by 6.7% to $0.64. As announced in yesterday’s press release, we are reiterating our 2014 AFFO guidance per share of $2.55 to $2.57 so we anticipate another solid year of earnings growth. Paul will provide you with an overview of the earnings numbers. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks John. As usual, I will briefly comment on our financial statements and provide some highlights of our financial results for the quarter. I’ll start by highlighting a few line items in our income statement. Total revenue increased 16.6% for the quarter. This increase reflects our growth primarily from new acquisitions over the past year, as well as same-store rent growth. Our annualized rental revenue at September 30th was approximately $912 million. On the expense side, interest expense increased in the quarter to $52.8 million. This increase was primarily due to our two recent bond offerings, the $350 million tenure notes issued in June and a $250 million 12 year notes issued in September. Interest expense was also impacted this quarter by the reclassification of approximately one month of preferred dividends as interest expense. Because we issued the redemption notice for our outstanding Preferred E Stock before quarter-end, we needed to reclassify the Preferred E Stock as a liability at quarter-end and about one month of preferred dividends as interest expense. This increased interest expense during the quarter by $1.2 million. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong with interest coverage at 3.7 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.3 times. General and administrative expenses in the quarter were approximately $11 million, a $5.6 million decrease from a year ago. G&A expenses year-to-date were $35.5 million, a $4.9 million decrease from the first nine months of last year. This decrease in G&A comes from lower acquisition transaction cost, $589,000 year-to-date versus $1.7 million of transaction cost for acquisitions in 2013 as well as lower stock compensation cost. We had a one-time unusual $3.7 million expense during the third quarter of 2013 due to accelerated vesting of our long-term stock compensation. Our projection for G&A for 2014 remains approximately $50 million. Our G&A year-to-date as a percentage of total rental and other revenues remains well at only 5.3% of revenues. And our current projection for G&A expenses in 2015 is approximately $53.5 million. Property expenses were $12.8 million in the quarter. However, this amount includes $8.3 million of property expenses reimbursed by tenants. So the property expenses that we are responsible for were approximately $4.5 million for the quarter. Our projection for 2014 of property expenses that we will be responsible for has increased slightly to approximately $17 million from a prior projection of $16.5 million. And our current projection for property expenses that we will be responsible for in 2015 is approximately $19 million. Provisions for impairment includes $495,000 of impairments we recorded on one sold property and three properties held for sale at September 30. Gain on sales were approximately $11 million in the quarter. And just a reminder, we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO. Excess of redemption value over carrying value preferred shares redeemed refers to the $6 million non-cash redemption charge for the unamortized original issuance costs which were paid when issuing and preferred E shares back in 2006. Funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.64 for the quarter, this would have been $0.67 per share, but it was reduced by $0.03 due to the redemption charge on the Class E preferred shares. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution and dividends was also $0.64 per share for the quarter. We again, increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. Our monthly dividend now equates to current annualized amount of approximately $2.197 per share. Briefly, turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. As you know in mid-September, we raised $250 million of 12 year bonds priced at a yield of 4.178%. Obviously we are pleased with our continued access to low cost, long-term capital in the bond market. The primary purpose of this offering was to redeem our $220 million of preferred E stock, which had a coupon of 6.75%. So, this transaction resulted in annual cash expense savings of almost $5.7 million. Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rate and continue to be rated BAA1, BBB plus have a weighted average maturity of 7.5 years. Our $1.5 billion acquisition credit facility had only a $45 million balance at September 30th. However, $220 million preferred E redemption closed earlier this month. So, the facility has an effective balance of $265 million. We did assume approximately $7 million of additional in place mortgages during the third quarter, but we also repaid $56 million of mortgage principal during the quarter. So, our outstanding net mortgage debt at quarter-end decreased to approximately $844 million. Not including our credit facility, the only variable rate debt exposure to rise in interest rate that we have is on just $39 million of mortgage debt. And our overall debt maturity schedule remains in very good shape with only $8 million of mortgage principal payments due in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $120 million in 2015. Our next bond maturity is only $150 million due in November of 2015 and our maturity schedule is well latter thereafter. Currently, our debt to total market capitalization is approximately 32% and our preferred stock outstanding is less than 3% of our capital structure. And our debt-to-EBITDA at quarter-end was only 5.9 times. Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on these results.
John Case : Thanks, Paul. I’ll begin with an overall of the portfolio, which is performing well and continues to generate dependable cash flow for our shareholders. Occupancy remains consistent with the previous quarter at 98.3% based on the number of properties with 74 properties available for lease out of 4,284 properties. Occupancy has held steady for three consecutive quarters now and is up 20 basis points from one year ago. Occupancy based on square footage and economic occupancy are both 99.1%. Based on what we're seeing today in our schedule rollover, we expect our occupancy to remain fairly stable for the remainder of the year. The third quarter was our most active quarter this year for lease rollover activity in the portfolio with leases expiring on 81 properties. Of these assets, we released 70 to existing tenants, 7 to new tenants and sold 4 properties recapturing a 100% of expiring rents on the properties we released. Our property portfolio management activities speak to the unique and extensive experience we have seen in our business full cycle where leases signed more than 20 years ago are rolling. Over our 45 year operating history, we have successfully executed more than 1,700 lease rollovers. We have a team of 36 professionals, many of whom have been with the company for over a decade working in our property portfolio management department. We believe our expertise in this area is a significant asset to our company. Our portfolio continues to be diversified by tenant industry, geography and to a certain extent, property type. At the end of the third quarter, our properties were leased to 231 commercial tenants and 47 different industries located in 49 states in Puerto Rico. 78% of rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties, while 22% is from non-retail, the largest component being industrial and distribution. This diversification continues to enhance the predictability of our cash flow. At the end of the third quarter, our top 10 and top 20 tenants represented 37.5% and 53.5% of rental revenue respectively. The tenants in our top 20 continue to capture nearly every tenant representing more than 1% of our rental revenue. There have been no material changes to the composition of tenants in our top 20 since last quarter. None of the top 20 tenants have investment grade credit ratings. The rental revenue from these non-investment grade rated tenants represents over half of the rent from our top 20 tenants. Within our portfolio no single-tenant accounts for more than 5.4% of rental revenue, so the diversification by tenant remains quite favorable. Walgreens continues to be our largest tenant at 5.4% of rental revenue, which is up slightly from last quarter. FedEx remains our second largest tenant at 5.1% of rental revenue, which is also up slightly from last quarter. Our 20th largest tenant represents only 1.2% of rental revenue and our 30th largest tenant accounts for just over 0.5% of rental revenue. We also added four new tenants to our portfolio this quarter, further diversifying our tenant base. As far as industries, convenience stores remain our largest industry at 10% of rental revenue and have continued to decline as a percentage of rental revenue for 14 quarters in a row. Our second largest industry is Dollar stores at 9.6%, down from 9.8% last quarter. As many of you know, there has been a lot in the news regarding the top three players in the Dollar store industry. With Dollar Tree and Dollar General competing by Family Dollar. The process remains fluid and one we continue to monitor. Family Dollar shareholders will determine the ultimate outcome here. We would expect the FTC's ruling on any trust concerns associated with the merger to impact the outcome. We remain quite comfortable with our Dollar Store portfolio. We continue to like the deep discount orientation of the Dollar store industry as lower and middle income consumers remain focused on value shopping. Family Dollar and Dollar General remain the dominant players in this industry. Our Family Dollar and Dollar General portfolios have an average lease term of 13 years with the unit level cash flow converge well above the overall average cash flow coverage in our retail portfolio of 2.6 times. A Family Dollar merger with either side should not have a material impact on our operations. Moving onto property type, retail continues to represent our primary source of rental revenue, currently at 78%, with industrial and distribution at 10%; office at 7%; and the remainder evenly divided between light manufacturing and agriculture. We continue to focus on retail properties leased to tenants with a service; non-discretionary; and/or low price point component to their business. Today more than 90% of our retail revenue come from businesses with these characteristics, which better positions them to successfully operate in all economic environments and to compete with e-commerce. Our weighted average remaining lease term continues to be approximately 10.5 years. Our same-store rents increased 1.4% during the quarter and 1.5% year-to-date consistent with our expectations for the foreseeable future. The industry is contributing most of our quarterly same-store rent growth for convenient stores, health and fitness and quick service restaurants. We continue to have excellent credit quality in the portfolio with 46% of our rental revenue generated from investment grade tenants. Again, we define an investment grade rated company as having an investment grade rating by one or more of the three major rating agencies. This revenue percentage is up from 40% one year ago. We continue to generate solid rental growth from these investment grade tenants. Nearly 70% of our investment grade leases as a percentage of rental revenues have rental rate increases in them which average approximately 1.4% annually, consistent with our historical portfolio rental growth rate. Overall, investment grade rental growth is about 1%. In addition to tenant credit, the store level performance of our retail tenants remains positive. On average, our rent coverage ratio on our retail properties is 2.6 times on four wall basis. Moving on to acquisitions. We continue to see a very high volume of sourced acquisition opportunities. During the quarter, we sourced over 7 billion in acquisition opportunities and year-to-date nearly 21 billion, making this already our second most active year ever for sourced transactions. There continues to be a lot of capital pursuing these transactions and we're seeing some very aggressive pricing in transaction structures in the market today. We continue to remain selective and disciplined in our investment strategy, investing at attractive risk adjusted returns and spreads for our shareholders. During the quarter, we completed $182 million in property level acquisitions at a cash cap rate of 7.4%, bringing us to $1.24 billion in acquisitions for the year at an initial cash cap rate of 7.1%. We're pleased with the yields, returns and spreads we're achieving. Given our low cost of capital, we continue to be able to invest at accretive levels. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital continue to be well above our historical averages. So we are investing at spreads that are nearly a 100 basis points wider than our long-term average. We anticipate closing approximately $1.4 billion in acquisitions this year, making 2014 our second most acquisitive year ever in our company’s history. Given the current environment, we’re establishing initial acquisitions guidance for 2015 of $500 million to $800 million. As you know, it’s notoriously difficult to predict future acquisitions activity. Volumes can be lumpy and can change significantly from quarter-to-quarter. However, we continue to see a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities. Given the backdrop of this acquisitions environment, we are increasing our asset sales this year from $75 million to approximately $100 million to take advantage of a more aggressive market for buying; this is twice our initial expectation of $50 million at the beginning of the year. During the quarter, we sold 11 properties for $33.5 million which brings us to 28 properties sold to-date for $53 million. These are our non-strategic assets being sold at attractive pricing. Let me hand it over to Sumit to discuss in more detail our acquisitions and dispositions. Sumit?
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John. During the third quarter of 2014, we invested $182 million in 49 properties located in 26 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.2 years. As a reminder, our initial cap rates or cash not GAAP which tend to be higher due to straight lining of rent. We define cash cap rates contractual cash net operating income for the first 12 months of each lease following the acquisition date, divided by the total cost of the property including all expenses borne by Realty Income. On a revenue basis, 53% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 96% of the revenues are generated from retail and 4% are from industrial and distribution. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 15 industries. Some of the most significant industries represented are home improvement and drugstores. Year-to-date 2014, we invested $1.24 billion in $439 properties located in 42 states at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and with the weighted average lease term of 12.6 years. Of the total amount, approximately $329 million was invested in non-investment grade retail properties. On a revenue basis, 70% of total acquisitions are from investment grade tenants. 86% of the revenues are generated from retail, 7% are from industrial, distribution and manufacturing and 7% are from office. These assets are leased to 51 different tenants in 27 industries. Some of the more significant industries represented are Dollar stores, home improvements and drugstores. Transaction flow continues to remain healthy. We sourced more than $7 billion in the third quarter of 2014. Year-to-date we have sourced approximately $21 billion in potential transaction opportunities, which as we mentioned last quarter would put us on pace to make 2014 the year with the second largest volume sourced in our company's history. Of these opportunities, 75% of the volumes sourced were portfolios and 25% or $5 billion were one-off assets. Investment grade opportunities represented 48% for the quarter. Of the $182 million in acquisitions closed in the third quarter, approximately 48% were one-off transactions. 69% of the transactions closed in the third quarter were relationship driven. We remained selective and disciplined in our investment approach closing on less than 6% of the deals sourced and continue to capitalize on our extensive industry relationships developed over our 45 year operating history. As to pricing, cap rates remained tight in the third quarter with investment grade properties trading from mid 5% to high 6% cap rate range and non-investment grade properties trading from low-to-mid 6% to low 8% cap rate range. As John highlighted, we had a very active quarter for dispositions and have increased our dispositions guidance to approximately $100 million to take advantage of the propitious cap rate environment. During the quarter, we sold 11 properties for $33.5 million at an unlevered IRR of just over 12%. This brings us to 28 properties sold year-to-date for $53.3 million at an unlevered IRR of approximately 11% and a net cap rate of 8.1% on the leased properties sold. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were very healthy, averaging 224 basis points in the third quarter and a 190 basis points year-to-date, which was significantly above our historical average spreads. We define investment spread as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. We are continuing to make investments above our historic spreads, whilst improving our real estate portfolio, tenant quality, credit quality and overall diversification. In conclusion, the third quarter investments remained healthy at $182 million. Year-to-date we have invested $1.24 billion, while sourcing approximately $21 billion in transactions. Our spreads remained comfortably above historical level as a tight cap rate environment in the third quarter was more than offset by improving cost of capital. We continue to be very selective in pursuing opportunities that are in line with our long-term strategic objectives and within our acquisition parameters. We also took advantage of an aggressive pricing environment to accelerate disposition of assets that are no longer a strategic fit. We remained confident of reaching our updated investment and disposition goals of approximately $1.4 billion and approximately $100 million respectively for 2014. With that, I would like to hand it back to John.
John Case: Thanks Sumit. Regarding our capital raising activities, as Paul mentioned, we've been quite active in the capital markets year-to-date. We have raised over $1.2 billion in permanent and long-term capital to finance our business. The majority being equity with the remainder being 10 and 12 year unsecured bonds. So, our balance sheet continues to be in excellent shape with two-thirds equity and one-third debt and that debt being predominantly long-term fixed rate. We currently have more than $1.2 billion available on the line to support future acquisitions activity so we continue to have excellent liquidity. Regarding earnings and guidance, we continue to generate healthy per share earnings growth, while maintaining a conservative capital structure. Our third quarter FFO and AFFO per share of $0.64 represented increases of 8.5% and 6.7% respectively from the period one year ago. As mentioned earlier, we are reiterating our 2014 AFFO guidance per share of $2.55 to $2.57, representing earnings growth of about 6% to 7%. We are anticipating another solid year for earnings growth next year and we are initiating 2015 guidance with AFFO per share from $2.66 to $2.71 implying year-over-year growth of approximately 4% to 6% over the midpoint of our 2014 range; and FFO per share of $2.67 to $2.72 which at the midpoint of the range represents an increase of approximately 4% over the midpoint of our 2014 range. Our focus continues to be the payment of reliable monthly dividends that grow over time. During the third quarter, we declared the 77th dividend increase since the company’s listing in 1994. Over this 20-year time period as a publicly traded company, we’ve grown the dividend by a compounded average annual growth rate of 4.6%. We remain committed to the durability and consistent growth of the dividend. Our payout ratio year-to-date has been 85.5% of our AFFO which is a level we continue to be comfortable with. As I am sure many of you saw in our separate press release yesterday, we’re pleased to announce Steve Sterrett, CFO of Simon Property Group as the 8th Member of our Board of Directors and 7th independent Board Member. We welcome Steve to Realty Income and look forward to working with him as a Member of our Board. Steve has spent 26 years at Simon Property Group, the largest real-estate company in the world and has spent the last 14 years as the CFO building a reputation of excellence in the industry. His depth of experience and relevance in our industry will enable him to be a valuable contributor to our Board. Finally to wrap it up, we continue to be pleased with our performance for the year. We’re seeing healthy volumes of acquisition opportunities and we’re on track to have our second most active year for acquisitions in our company’s history. We will remain selective and disciplined with regards to our investment strategy and we'll continue to acquire high quality properties quite accretively with our cost of capital advantage and at attractive risk adjusted returns for our shareholders. At this time, I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. 
Juan Sanabria - Bank of America: Hi, good afternoon guys. I was just hoping you could give us a little color on the 2015 acquisition guidance, sort of how you came to that number and then background on any spreads or cap rates we should thinking about with regards to that number? And just optically, I know you've kind of stated and stressed that you want to be selective, but just how we should be thinking about that versus the number you put out there for 2014 for the year?
John Case: Okay Juan. Let me just spend a moment on acquisitions. We continue to see inactive pipeline of sourced acquisition opportunity, so there is good transaction flow. And as we said, our investment spreads are well above our historical average. But there is also a lot of capital pursuing these opportunities. So, it has been competitive and we remain disciplined and selective with our investment strategy. We're seeing some very aggressive pricing out there among some of our peers and structures, looking at replacement cost; we're seeing assets trade sometimes at 50% above the replacement costs. We’re seeing properties that have rents that are well above market rents trading at aggressive pricing. Then we’re seeing some pretty aggressive structures as well. So we’re seeing for instance and some of the casual dining transactions that have crossed our gas, we’re seeing them get dine at very high coverage ratios, ratios we’re not comfortable with. So we’ve been in this business a long time and I think we have a pretty good idea of what’s going to work and what’s not going to work long-term. Clearly, given our cost of capital, we could do these transactions and initially that would be quite accretive. But when you look at them over the long-term, if they’re not structured and priced properly, you’re going to have some low IRRs and pay the price on the residual, and they could actually the value destructive to our shareholders long-term. Our range for acquisitions for 2015 reflects the environment we’re in today. As you know that environment can change significantly from quarter-to-quarter even month-to-month. I mean if an aggressive buyers out there that all of a sudden slows down or exits the market that could have a material impact on our volume and potentially pricing. So at this point, predicting acquisitions guidance year in advance is always difficult. And we’ve always wanted to be accurate, but not over promise. Historically, we’ve exceeded our initial guidance. If you look at last year, we had $1 billion acquisitions guidance number in October of 2013 for 2014 and we're going to exceed that by about 40%. But as usual, we'll just have to see how that year shapes up next year, but one thing we're not going to do is abandon our investment discipline simply to generate volume. Let me speak to your second point in that spreads and cap rates. Sumit addressed that on the call, but investment grade cap rates we see them get a little tighter. Investment grade is running from the mid 5s to the high 6s and non-investment grade the low 6s all the way up to 8%. As far as spreads go for the year, we've invested spreads of 190 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital. In the third quarter that was 220 basis points. And given our cost of capital today, we're looking at 240 basis points, which are near our all time record spreads. So, they remained quite attractive, but again we've got to look at this business beyond just what it's going to do over the next quarter or next year and we're looking at 10 or 11 year average 13 year or 14 year average lease terms. So, hopefully that answers your question.
Juan Sanabria - Bank of America:  Definitely very thorough. Thanks John. And just a quick follow-up if you don't mind. Given how aggressive pricing is, what’s the viewer on dispositions for 2015 is it anything big to the numbers?
John Case: We've assumed for 2015 $50 million for now and we're going to watch that pretty closely. We started out this year assuming $50 million and we're going to end up selling $100 million approximately. So, the environment continues to be heated. We're going to go ahead and move some assets, some additional assets off our watch list and take advantage of the strong bid in the market. And I think pricing will improve here in the next few months is my prediction in terms of disposition. So, in the model we have $50 million, but we’re going to watch that pretty closely and if the environment continues to look like it does today, we could see increasing that up to $100 million.
Juan Sanabria - Bank of America: Great. Thank you very much for the time.
John Case: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo: Hi, thanks guys. Sumit you gave cap rate ranges for investment grade and non-investment grade, tentative properties. Were those for the properties you acquired in Q3? Just want to get the range of cap rates you acquired because the blended 7.4 yield I thought was pretty high even though it worth payable to land over 50% investment grade.
Sumit Roy: Yes. So, Todd those were the ranges of assets that we saw transact in the market. We didn’t -- I don’t believe we bought anything in the low or mid 5% cap rate range. The main reason for the yield that we were able to achieve in the third quarter of a 7.4 was being driven by 18% of the volume was coming from our build-to-suit development funding, as well as some of our forward commitments, which typically has been a much smaller portion of the total acquisition volume, it’s been right around 3%, but in the third quarter that represented closer to 18%. And clearly the mix of investment grade and non-investment grade also played a part in why we were able to achieve the higher yield.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo: That’s helpful. And then just kind of just switching gears, can you share how some of the re-leasing discussions went with tenants? It looks like while you renewed 77 leases, just looking back at the Q2 results, about 50, only 50 leases were coming due in the second half of the year. So, I just want to see, the tenants comfort level in renewing leases ahead of time, it looks like a fair amount of those were maturities not coming due just yet?
John Case: That's exactly right. I mean we're always looking for, Todd, managing our rollover and if we can enter into discussions that are advantageous for us and our tenants to re-lease early, we will do that. So, that's why you see that 77 number versus what was scheduled to roll in the quarter. So, we're pleased with that and we'll continue to do that. We're just trying to stay in front of these maturities and our leases and stay in front of them a couple of quarters or longer if we can even.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo: Is there a comfort level with tenants anything that you can, any trends are developing that tenants are able to renew or their willingness to renew it little early, anything there?
John Case: Yes. Well, I think in general our tenants are in better shape than they were certainly five years ago; their operations and balance sheets are much stronger; they are more likely to renew. So, we're leasing of the lease rollovers we're executing, 90% are going to the same tenant; 10% to a new tenant. If you look at the history of the company that's been more 70% to the same tenant and 20% to new tenant and then 10% sold. So, those statistics show you that the tenants are more comfortable renewing their leases on the properties and staying in those properties. And it’s a function of a better economic environment, but we also like to think it’s also a function of better underwriting, better tenant selection, site selection on our part having learned from 45 years history in this business.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo: Thanks John. And just was there cost or what was the cost associated with retaining and attracting new tenants; have you guys put out a TI number?
John Case: Yes. We are -- that will be in our supplemental. So we spent 125,000 in tenant improvements in the third quarter to re-lease 16.3 million in rental revenue. So that number is de minimis, it usually is dominants; it runs from less than 1% of revenues up to maybe 2%. So, it’s never a material number, but we’re actually including that in our supplement going forward.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo: Great. Thank you.
John Case: Thank you, Todd.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.
Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. Sumit, could you just give us, sorry, I apologize if I missed this. But for the acquisitions that you’ve taking for next year, what are the cap rates you’re assuming or the range of cap rates?
John Case: We’re assuming 7% for next year.
Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley: Okay.
John Case: Year-to-date we’re at 7.1%. The 7.4%, if we were very pleased with but that’s little higher than what we’re expecting given the current market conditions.
Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley: And then just given the numbers you quoted on market cap rates between investment grade and non-investment grade, would you expect next year to be a little different in terms of just composition between the two for deals that you do?
Sumit Roy: No. I think listen, a lot of it is going to be a function of what's going to be available out there. And I think we've stated this in previous calls as well. We don't target a particular composition with regards to investment grade versus non-investment grade when we're looking at acquisitions. This particular quarter it just turned out where investment grade represented only 53% whereas year-to-date it's closer to 70%. So, we're going to look at opportunities that present themselves. There is a lot of discussion around certain retail asset classes that tend to be more non-investment grade in nature. So it's very difficult to predict as to what the composition of that 500 million to 800 million that John has mentioned is going to turn out to be at the end.
Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then just maybe on the competition for deals, as you mentioned, it's obviously increased but maybe looking out into '15, maybe just give us your high level thoughts on did you see that competition changing in any way? I know new regulations on the non-traded side don't kick in for a while but could that be a factor as you get towards the year end or could there just be other factors that may make the environment just more competitive or less competitive from your standpoint?
John Case: Well, we continue to compete with the other public companies and certainly the non-listed REITs. As you've said, the capital raising has slowed down a little bit there but there is still a lot of equity in those entities. We compete with mortgage REITs and institutional investment managers who are running money for sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, endowments looking for yield. So we bump in to some of them as well. I think that the last few quarters have been some of the most competitive we've seen. And there is certainly some activities out there in the sector that would lead me to believe that the competition could become a little less than tense next year. Again it’s impossible to accurately forecast, but our sense is some of the more aggressive buyers maybe stepping back a bit from the market. So that would be the case. We certainly feel better about the higher-end of our acquisitions range.
Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then some -- okay, okay. Just last clarification is on the timing of these acquisitions, is there anything different we should assume for next year versus just normal seasonality that we see during the year?
John Case: They’re normal, they’re lumpy and they’re really driven by portfolios. And again like last year 2013 we did $1.52 billion in property level acquisitions, the last quarter was a $140 million. This year the first quarter was $650 million and this quarter was a $182 million. You’re going to see that lumpiness because it’s associated with the amount of acquisitions that get done through portfolios. So, I think that will continue. So, we’ll have some heavy quarters and some light quarters like we always have.
Vikram Malhotra - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks guys.
John Case: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Todd Lukasik with Morningstar.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Hi. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wondering if you could comment on the weighted average remaining lease term for the portfolio overall. And I guess let’s say 5 or more years ago I kind of assume that was going to fall in the range of 12 years or longer generally. And I think now it’s around 10.4 years. And just if you can comment around that I guess the change in properties that you guys own now may influence that, but also whether or not you manage to that number and what you'd expect it to be in five or ten years or how that will likely trend?
John Case: Yes. Well, I mean when you've got $15 billion in assets and each year passes the lease-term actually declines by year and it's offset partially by acquisitions. And so, if you're acquiring a $1.5 billion at 13 years, you're not going to fully offset the decrease in lease-term on the existing portfolio. On rollovers, you are typically -- if the rollovers go to the same tenant, they are five year lease-terms, if it's a new tenant it's closer to ten years. So, it's a natural evolution for a season that lease company like ourselves to see that lease-term overtime decline. We still focus on average lease-terms of 11, 12, 13, 14 years that’s what we're seeing, that's what we're doing. But you’ve got to remember on the rest of the portfolio, they're getting a bit shorter. And I think one of our strength is to effectively execute lease rollovers. We've executed over 1,700 lease rollovers in our company's history, recapturing nearly a 100% of the expiring rent. And we've got a team of almost 40 professionals dedicated to that effort that they have been with the company; many of them 10 to 20 years. And that’s where I’ve said this before where the rubber meets the road in the business, that’s where you really need to be able to execute and reserve value. And there are not a lot of net lease companies out there that have that expertise and that extensive experience. So, we’re very comfortable with our ability to extend the shorter lease terms and the longer lease terms that eventually need to be addressed as those leases expire. I mean some of the leases, we handled this quarter, we looked at and they were put in place 25 years ago. So again we’d have a very long-term perspective. Does that help Todd?
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Yes, it does. That’s great. Thanks for all that color. And then just a follow-up question on the acquisition guidance for next year. I’m curious, if you are also expecting that the acquisition volume that source is going to be lower or whether you expect that to be relatively constant; you guys are just going to a little bit choosier about what you actually try to close?
John Case: It’s continuing to be active in this quarter. We would expect transaction flow in terms of sourced acquisition opportunities to be strong again next year; all indicators were pointing to that it will be. 2013 was a record at 39 billion. This year, we’re already a 21 billion, which is our second best year ever just nine months into the year. So I think that we’ll continue to see that momentum, but again we’ll continue to be selective and disciplined in what we buy. There are a number of discussions going on with respect to sale leasebacks with corporate board; corporate management teams; activist investors. We don't know how many of these are going to end up playing out but it's just one or two or three hit, you could see some very big sourced volumes that could lead to higher acquisition. So that activity in terms of activist investors and corporate boards and management teams scrutinizing their real estate holdings and making sure they’re properly and efficiently managing their real estate is accelerating. So there are more discussions. Unfortunately we're involved in those discussions and that really could impact source opportunities next year there to monetize some of that real estate. 
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Okay, great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the American Realty Capital Properties Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). After today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instruction). Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to [Barney Rosen], Director of IR of ARCP. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Corporate Participant: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review American Realty Capital Properties’ second quarter 2014 earnings report. Joining me today are David Kay, President; Brian Block, Chief Financial Officer, Lisa Beeson, Chief Operating Officer, Richard A. Silfen, General Counsel, and [Michael Ryder], Senior Vice President. This morning’s call is being webcast on our website at arcpreit.com in the investor relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at approximately 1 pm Eastern Time today. Dial in for the replay is 18-77-344-7529 with a confirmation code of 10049338. Before I turn the call over to David I would like to remind everyone that statements in this earnings call which are not historical facts will be forward looking. ARCP’s actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and the risk factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC report. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports ARCP disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as expressly required by law. Let me quickly review the format of today’s call. First, David will provide an update key corporate initiative followed by comments on the second quarter. Brian will review our operating results for the quarter, detail our execution on several strategic balance sheet initiatives and walk through our earnings guidance for 2014; Lisa will update us on operations across our businesses including Cole Capital and acquisition activity. Now I would like to turn the call over to ARCP’s President, David Kay. David?
David Kay: Thank you Barney. Good afternoon everyone. My experience at ARCP these past 7.5 months has been amazing. I would not be more excited about my Senior Management team and the future prospects of this company. From afar it may appear at times our rapid growth is hard to understand. I can assure you however that everything we do is directed towards a singular objective to create value for our shareholders. So, why am I excited? I can tell you that it has a lot do with our people, our culture the opportunities we see in the marketplace and our competitive advantages. Today we have roughly 30 billion of assets managed by more than 425 talented people located strategically throughout the country. We have built this company with the future in mind and we are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities as they arrive. While I expect not all of our decisions will be met with universal approval I can assure you that our management team and Board of Directors act only where they sincerely believe that such actions will add value over the long-term. For the past several months I have spent a considerable amount of time with the investment and research analyst community. I have been asked hundreds of questions and many express a sense of incredulity namely how is this possible? For example, I am often asked how can a company of our size consistently invest in properties at cap rates meaningfully better than our competitors. There is no alchemy here I assure you. In part, our ability to invest at prices better than our peer group result from our origination team being largest in the industry. We see and evaluate a very large volume of properties and our sheer size firstly assures us that we see every marketed transaction a large number of off market deals and all the largest sales that fit our strategy. We have already originated, put under contract or closed and underwritten more than $6 billion for the first-half of the year which happens to be more than the assets under management of many of our peers. Moreover our pricing advantage also lies in the diversity of properties in which we invest. The mixture of traditional investment grade long-term leases, high quality non-investment grade tentative properties and medium term vintage leases which afford us relatively higher yields in a broad spectrum of industries create better overall returns, broader diversity and ultimately better portfolio metrics. The key to our growth has been to construct a large talented team of acquisition professionals proficient in the origination of both individual properties, small portfolios while at the same time being expert at underwriting large sale lease back deals such as the Red Lobster transaction we closed yesterday. In addition, we have a seasoned unit of professionals that focus on build-to-suit transactions in our space, another way in which we are able to enhance our returns while carefully managing our risk. Our team sees every deal in the marketplace we are often the first to see the deal. In many cases not only we’re afforded first look at these potential transactions but we also have last look as well. This gives us a competitive advantage and deep market insight as to the pricing and structure. Another obvious difference between us and our peers is our broker-dealer Cole Capital which provides us with the unique access to an alternative equity source. This enables us to generate EBITDA without the need for balance sheet leverage, with key selling agreements currently in place for LinkedIn, Cetera, Cambridge, First Allied and our largest partner LPL give me great confidence that our capital raise will be consistent with our projections. Over the past quarter Cole Capital has been a source of many questions but I will let the results for the coming two quarters speak for themselves. Our team is working hard to build upon the Cole brand and believe we are well positioned given our very strong strategic relationships with key broker dealers coupled with our prior performance to grow this segment of our business. Before I turn the call over to Brian who will speak about our financials, I would like to talk about the equity offering we completed this quarter. I am pleased that we raised the money and deleveraged the balance sheet. With plenty of uncertainty in the global economy heading into the summer reducing our leverage was the right choice, although not the most popular choice. I am confident that our management team and the board made the right decision to raise equity and reduce our overall financial risk. Certain circumstances require hard decisions and there will be many more in the future. Our decision – our decisions will always come back to the same fundament first principal; are the steps we are taking designed to improve shareholder returns while managing risk appropriately? In October this year I will become Chief Executive Officer of ARCP. As with any large company there will challenges as well as opportunities but the foundation laid over the past several quarters position the company for the future success. We have exceptionally talented and dedicated Board, executive management team and employee base, a uniquely entrepreneurial culture, the most diversified property portfolio, a modestly leveraged balance sheet, the most investment grade tenant concentration, the highest occupancy percentage, the longest weighted average lease term, over 12 years nearly $12 billion of unencumbered assets, strong coverage ratios, one of the lowest average cost of debt in the industry and experienced origination and underwriting team and solid credit metrics. ARCP is positioned for success. It’s now not about creating this foundation but building upon it. I could not be more excited about the prospects for this company and I look forward to our future together. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian who will review the financial performance.
Brian Block: Great, thank you David and good morning to everybody. Our second quarter results are in line with our expectations. Revenues for the period were $382 million and AFFO was a $198.6 million or $0.24 per share fully diluted share which represented 26% increase from this period last year. We are confident with our guidance range for the full year of 2016 of $1.13 to $1.19 per share. I’ll speak more to this earnings guidance shortly in my prepared remarks. Over the last three months we have significantly delevered our balance sheet as a result of our common stock offering and improved our liquidity and flexibility with our extended and upsized line of credit. As of June 30th, our weighted average interest rate was 3.7% which includes our line of credit with a weighted average tenure of 5.5 years. We will continue to lengthen our maturities and look to complete a sizeable bond offering during the latter part of this year. We have continued to refinance short-term duration and high cost merger-related assumed debt and we can further our efforts as an unsecured borrower. In the second quarter $282 million was refinanced which coupled with the first quarter activities result in a year-to-date total of about $1 billion of refinancing. This $1 billion had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.7% and remaining average duration of two years. We are targeting an additional $550 million to be refinanced in the third quarter which will further allow us to enhance our credit ratings, our stability liquidity and balance sheet metrics for the long-term. The weighted average coupon associated with this for remaining $550 million is about 6% which creates enhanced arbitrage relative to our current cost of borrowings. We utilized our credit facility to complete the acquisition of Red Lobster yesterday. The $1.4 billion to be generated from the sale of our multi-tenant portfolio will be used to pay down our line of credit as well and extend our overall capacity. We are in active dialog with the rating agencies with respect to a bond offering and will see these bonds re-rated at the highest possible investment grade by the agencies. Based on the recent strategic actions we have taken to reduce leverage de-risk our balance sheet, lengthen debt maturities, increase overall unencumbered assets and extend our credit facility our discussion with the rating agencies will include the potential for future upgrades of our credit rating as our company matures. Across the organization we are fully integrated and are realizing identified synergies of about $77 million on an annualized basis with roughly $30 million already accomplished today. We have about 425 employees today across the country working cohesively and we are in tandem to implement a long-term strategy as a unified front. Additionally, our internal operations continues to strengthen. The synergy created by the innovation of the Cole team and the adoption of new technology has allowed to be more timing efficient in our financial reporting. In fact, this enhanced scale allowed us to move up the timing of our 10-Q filing and earnings call as a result of these improvements by roughly a week. Let me turn to our earnings guidance numbers. On page six, of the [free running] prospectus that was filed today there is an AFFO guidance reconciliation that takes actual first and second quarter results on AFFO basis plus the run-rate based on Q2 and adjusts it for the major pro forma items. These adjustments include the closing of the Red Lobster portfolio which occurred yesterday, the sale of our multi-tenant portfolio to Black Stone which should occur by the beginning of the fourth quarter, the closing of our pipeline balance sheet acquisitions for the remainder of 2014, which brings the total acquisition to our forecasted $4.5 billion and interest savings expected on the debt to be refinanced during the second-half of 2014. The second-half estimated AFFO projected run rate of $533 million, includes the full quarter results of properties acquired during the second quarter – sorry includes second quarter as well G&A for the second-half of the year of approximately $80 million which is inclusive of commissions and cost synergies. This is consistent with our full year estimate of total G&A including non-cash compensation of approximately $176 million. The run rate AFFO also includes an estimate for Cole Capital based on our projected $3.1 billion of capital raise and $4.9 billion of acquisitions into the managed funds. The projection results in AFFO for Cole Capital for full year of approximately $120 million. Before turning the call over to Lisa I should take a moment to welcome Mike Sodo who is joining our team on August 5th as a Senior Vice President and Director of Finance Report and Treasury. His experience and expertise will complement our team of financial professionals while enhancing financial oversight reporting controls and in treasury functions as well as our investor outreach. With that let me turn the call over to Lisa.
Lisa Beeson: Thank you Brian, let me start by discussing Cole Capital. We currently have three non-listed REITs raising capital with total equity capacity of $8.5 billion. As we’ve articulated in the past, capital raising for traditional non-traded REITs is cyclical in nature with a majority of capital being raised as signed agreements are executed and programs mature. Looking at our capital raising results Cole Capital raised approximately $161 million during the second quarter for a total of just over $1 billion for the first six months. We’re making good progress towards our capital raise goal of $3.1 billion as we are ramping up the sales of CCIT II, and Cole V more quickly than their predecessor funds. We also hit a notable milestone for Cole Income NAV, our continuously offered non-listed REIT that provides daily valuation and daily liquidity when it recently surpassed a $100 million in capital raised. We’ve made tremendous progress obtaining selling agreements with large broker dealers such as Schwab, LinkedIn and Cetera. This includes adding LPL our largest partner last week and we anticipate an agreement with CCIT II later this week. Historically the relationship with LPL has accounted for substantial capital raise and we expect to see similar results with all three products up and running on their platform. Our team is geared up to capitalize on these relationships including sponsoring and attending the LPL Sales Forum in August where we will have the opportunity to reintroduce Cole Capital with the power of ARCP as the parent company. [Finrock] recently submitted a revised proposal for RN1406 to the SEC. We’re fully supportive of this regulation to leading to pricing on customer accounts statement for non-traded REITs and other direct participation programs. The new rules which are expected to be implemented in 2016 are inline although slightly later than what we expected. We believe this proposal is a good process and we’re supportive of the statement enhancements in providing further shareholder transparency. We also believe this transparency will be effective in the long-run increasing the number of financial advisors who sell these products. Consensus is that capital raising in the non-traded space should be very high for 2015 in advance of this implementation. During the quarter on behalf of our managed REITs our acquisitions team acquired $751 million of real estate comprising a 134 properties. In July we closed an additional $128 million of acquisitions and have a further $1.34 billion of acquisitions under contract we aim to close by year-end. So far this year we’ve acquired replacement of contract $2.6 billion on behalf of Cole Capital. We remain confident in our ability to invest $4.9 billion of assets for this year for our managed funds. Let me now turn to ARCP’s acquisitions and portfolio. Our acquisitions remained strong during the quarter, bringing the total of combined closed and pipeline transactions on the balance sheet to approximately $4.25 billion as of July 28. For the second quarter, this included $835 million of acquisitions comprised of a 165 properties in 72 individual transactions. We only have $250 million of transaction activity left to hit our $4.5 billion of guidance. Our team of 26 professionals has continued to source investment opportunities. Granular transactions, large scale leaseback transactions and build pursuits. As planned with cash cap rates closed or under contract as of July 28 of approximately 7.7 and GAAP cap rates of 8.7. Our team is able to use the relationship to effectively source acquisitions directly with sellers off market from brokers and through traditionally marketed opportunities. For a single retail tenant portfolio 66% of the transactions were direct with the sellers or off market. For office and industrial 41% were direct with sellers or off market. Our real estate credit and legal under writing team of 50 individuals which remains separate and independent from our originations team continues to review every potential acquisition against key criteria and due diligence requirements. As a result of this deep bench we are able to source, underwrite and close transaction on a granular base as quickly and efficiently. Now let me turn to our balance sheet portfolio at the end of the quarter, pro forma for the Red Lobster acquisition which closed yesterday and excluding the multi-tenant properties being sold prior to the fourth quarter. Our occupancy remains at 99.8%. 46% of the portfolio tenancy is rated investment grade and an additional 22% is rated. We expect the portfolio to generate growth of 1.2% before taking into account CPI based escalators or percentage rents. 62% of our rental revenues are derived from retail and restaurants, 23% from office and 15% from industrial and distribution properties. Our ten largest tenants including Red Lobster on a GAAP rental revenue basis accounted for 31% of rental revenue. Our next ten tenants account for approximately 12% of rental revenue bringing our top 20 tenant mix to 43%. Yesterday we closed a $1.5 billion sale leaseback transaction for Red Lobster. This transaction was structured whereby we selected the best location and divided the properties into multiple lease pools with long-term cross defaulted leases with financial covenants and restrictions on leverage and assignability. We spent a significant amount of time not only underwriting the real estate but working with Golden Gate and Red Lobster management team to understand their business plan. We acquired this portfolio at a 7.9 cash cap rate and a 9.9 GAAP cap rate. The portfolio has EBITDAR to rent coverage greater than 2.2 times and should improve as sea food cost normalized and the management team drives efficiencies. We’re buying this portfolio at 82% of replacement cost in markets with strong demographic. Darden recently spent 350 million during the past seven years on remodel and $1.4 billion in overall CapEx over the past ten years. Another major transaction we announced this past quarter was the sale of substantially all of our multi-tenant shopping center portfolio to affiliates of Blackstone real estate partners for 1.975 billion. The sales of our multi-tenant properties furthers our strategy of simplifying our story as a pure playing net lease REIT, improves our occupancy rates, decreases capital expenditures, eliminates $600 million of secured debt and reduces operating complexity. We currently plan to close this transaction towards the end of the third quarter, beginning of fourth quarter. The sale of the multi-tenant portfolio and the purchase of the Red Lobster portfolio provide for accretion which maximizes value for our stockholders. We use our upside extended credit facility to complete the acquisition of Red Lobster and will repay the line with proceeds from the multi-tenant sale proceeds. In the interim we will be generating significant NOI from both portfolios. David I’ll turn the call back over to you.
David Kay: Thank you Lisa and Brian. Before we take questions I wanted to touch briefly on corporate governance. As Nick outlined in yesterday’s stockholder letter this will be one of his major initiative undertakings as he transitions into his singular role as Chairman. We have made great strides towards improving our corporate governance in the past month and we have a great number of initiatives underway. As we take these next steps we are focused not only inwardly on governance but also outwardly so that the governance rating organizations take note of our continued progress. Through these efforts we are demonstrating our commitment to mitigating risk and creating greater transparency while ultimately creating long term value for our shareholders. We hope you can appreciate the transparency provided this quarter and we continue to focus on supplying the most meaningful information to you about the Company and our guidance. As always we are available after these calls for detailed discussions. In an effort to maximize your time and allow everyone a chance to ask questions today please keep this is in mind. With that I will now ask the operator to open line for question.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Juan Sanabria, Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning. Just a couple of questions on slide six of the presentation, to get to your AFFO per share of above 14 highlighted there, are the adjustments just for the stub period, as in Red Lobster $44 million is just as of from August onwards?
David Kay: Yes, that’s actually what’s going to occur in the second half of the year. So this results in where we should end up for year-end 2014.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, and are the Red Lobster and multi-tenant portfolio numbers, are those net of any interest expense or how should we think about that?
David Kay: I will let [Michael Ryder] answer that.
Unidentified Corporate Participant: Hey Juan. Yes, all of the numbers that you see on page six under the pro forma adjustments for each item there, that encapsulates any revenue coming in or going out and the associated interest expense.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, and then can you just give us a little bit more color on the interest savings and kind of how that’s derived?
David Kay: Go ahead Mike.
Unidentified Corporate Participant: Sure, so post Q2 you can see on the left there’s about $650 million or mortgage and some other debt that’s being refinanced as well as along with our amended credit facility the rate dropped substantially to what you see on the left hand side of the page. So the revolver is priced at LIBOR plus 135 and our term is LIBOR plus 150.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay and then how should we…
David Kay: We’ll look to term out debt long term towards the latter portion of the year so we will build up the line. In the interim we will pay the line down once we get the proceeds from the Arc Center sale and then we will look to term the rest out in a longer term unsecured bond deal.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay and so that longer term unsecured is not included in this correct?
David Kay: It will be towards the very end of the year.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay and what are you guys thinking in terms of term and potential size of that unsecured offering?
David Kay: We currently have no maturities in the seven year time frame. So we’ll look probably for a portion of that but we continue to look for longer term and so with 10 year available and a recent 12 and 15 year done in the market place, we’ll look at all of those see where the pricing is, and see where those maturities fit our current maturity schedule. Last time we did 5s and 10s primarily we also did the shorter obviously that refinanced the core capital debt. So we’ll look to lengthen the maturities.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then on the corporate governance, is Nick’s compensation is part of the Board’s view also going to be looked at in order to as you sort of mentioned earlier tick the boxes with the third-party governance parties?
David Kay: Nick’s contract, no, included his transition out of CEO already but as with any compensation committee they will do a full view of everything but Nick’s contract is fully in play.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay and can you just talk a little bit about what you guys think you may do with regard to compensation on a go-forward basis that would kind of tick the boxes with firms like ISS?
David Kay: You know again our Board has a committee established and they will use the consultant as they have in the past. I think the high point now is that Nick, myself and Bryan have opted to take nearly all of our cash compensation which is everything but our base salaries which are, as you guys know fairly small relative to total comp, we decided to take all of our cash bonus in the form of stock as well as the additional stock obviously that we get. So those are the – that’s what we are doing right now. The comp committee with continue to evaluate compensation and obviously with my appointment to CEO in October they’ll review my compensation with regards to that.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay great and one last question from me CapEx I saw $47 million of I think it was CapEx highlighted in the 10-Q, is that related to the shopping center portfolio that is going to be sold and can you talk about expectations for a normalized triple net CapEx number we should be thinking about?
David Kay: Yeah, that was related to the multi-tenant and obviously significantly smaller in terms of that. I can turn that over to Lisa to talk about.
Lisa Beeson: Sure and it also includes a portion of the capital as part of the build to suit transactions we do where it’s put forward as capital expenditures instead of just flowing through on an acquisition basis. So it’s both pieces of the – both pieces.
David Kay: I think another item to note one is that we continue to – our office as a percentage of the entire portfolio continues to shrink now just above 20% considerably down from where it was six to nine months ago. So as that continues to shrink it should have a substantially less CapEx as compared to obviously what you would see in terms of single tenant retail and restaurant.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
David Kay: Thanks Juan.
Operator: Our next question is Mitch Germain, JMP. Please go ahead.
Mitch Germain – JMP Securities: Hey, great quarter guys.
David Kay: Thank you Mitch.
Mitch Germain – JMP Securities: I saw you referenced a number of advisors, I think it was may be 45,000, just curious I know Lisa mentioned LPL added – where was that from, is there, can you put that in context where you were last quarter?
David Kay: Just to put I mean in the broadest of terms LPL represent 12,000 advisors and they just come on this past last week and will bring on the second fund with them on Thursday. So we are very excited about that, it’s a big uptick. We have had a significant number of new firms as well and I think one of the keys to this business is not only are we building it for 2014 but we are building it for the future. Cole Capital previously focused very much on the top 20 broker dealers and we have because of the lengthy due diligence processes, because of the merger et cetera we have been able to really focus a lot of the effort on the bottom 200 and so we have collectively we will have a much, much broader broker dealer network out there on a go forward basis. And I think that will ultimately provide much more upside in terms of the volume of capital that we can raise and ultimately the volume of capital that we can deploy for 2015 and beyond. So I am very excited about the opportunity for this and we have really expanded the network.
Mitch Germain – JMP Securities: Great and obviously you are near that $4.5 billion target for acquisitions. I know the focus is raising equity in the PCM business, putting capital to work there but does anything – is there any possibility that you would surpass that $4.5 billion?
David Kay: Not really our focus is really on sticking to what we said we were going to do which is we believe our leverage levels at the $4.5 billion number are the right number. We are not going to raise equity for the remainder of this year and we have a significant amount of capital that we will be able to deploy in the Cole Capital business and generate a significant amount of EBITDA there and we are anticipating the majority, vast majority of all the property to be directed into those managed funds.
Mitch Germain – JMP Securities: And then the leverage profile on the managed funds David or may be Lisa, I think you guys had referenced you are going to run the balance sheets there a little bit differently, is there can we kind of is there is a certain leverage target that we should look at in terms of how you are looking to run the funds going forward?
David Kay: Yeah, those funds are typically leveraged fairly modestly at around 40% and I think that one of the keys to that business is that capital comes in obviously it ebbs and flows and properties come in and they ebb and flow and they don’t always match-up exactly although that has been obviously our history in terms of being able to buy very granularly, raise $10 million buy $10 million, raise $5 million buy $5 million. That is what we you know hoped to do obviously. It doesn’t always work out that way. So leverage may tick-up in an interim period for weeks or month, may rise to 50%-55% and drops back down to potentially below 40% and could be 30’s as capital comes in. So you can see those things ebb and flow at any given time. What’s really important is where anticipate ultimately the funds being at a leverage level of around 40% at their close and so there is no difference in target. They are very conservative funds, they are paying north of six yield right now and those investors are looking for durability of income and stability and that’s what we are providing to them.
Mitch Germain – JMP Securities: Great. David, my last question is just an update on CCIC, I know I believe you are pursuing strategic alternatives as previously announced, where does that stand please? Thanks.
David Kay: You know Wells in the process of marketing that. I don’t know the ultimate progress on that but a liquidity event could be possible there, may take place by the end of the year or very early 2015. It’s a very, very strong portfolio, great credits very long-term leases there is a lot of suitors for it. From what we understand it is about 75% or so office, very high quality. Obviously our directive has been reduce our overall office exposures it’s not something that would fit in our portfolio at all but a very, very high quality portfolio that could trade at a very good level and be a great portfolio for another company.
Mitch Germain – JMP Securities: Thanks, great quarter.
David Kay: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is Chris Lucas, Capital One. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas – Capital One Securities: Good morning everyone.
David Kay: Hey, Chris.
Chris Lucas – Capital One Securities: David could you maybe walk through a little bit about the synergies on the G&A and where you stand how the headcount is evolving and where you expect it to be sort of by year end as you think through sort of the continued integration?
David Kay: Sure as Brian and Lisa had touched on, we currently are at about 425 employees or so. We have realized about $38 million in synergies to date. We are targeting the mid the mid upper 70’s in terms of where we would like to be, close to 80 if we can get to. We have had some real progress this past quarter Lisa and her team, Kurt McAlister at Cole Capital, just the full spectrum of employee and senior management within this firm have done just an exceptional job at really producing synergies. As Brian said the second-half of our estimates include cash G&A of about $80 million that is really getting the remaining portion of those synergies squeezed out to get close to that $80 million and I think that you know we are making great progress in that respect.
Chris Lucas – Capital One Securities: Okay, thank you. And then is it relates to the refinancing I’m I have got two different numbers I think I am looking at here. I think maybe it was referenced 550 million at roughly 6% and then the slide six mentioned $650 million which one are we looking at?
David Kay: Go ahead Mike.
Unidentified Corporate Participant: Yeah, the $650 million is what’s anticipated in the second-half of the year, is a little bit cost over with the date in terms of what actually got repaid prior to the end of the year.
Chris Lucas – Capital One Securities: Okay. And then does that also include the redemption of the series D as part of that number?
Unidentified Corporate Participant: Yes, it does.
Chris Lucas – Capital One Securities: Okay, and then on the – maybe this is for Lisa, as you look at the proposed rules, how do you expect the business to evolve as it relates to the PCM business. How do you expect that rule to impact? How these assets are these funds are actually sold?
Lisa Beeson: We actually think in the long-run that it’s going to help grow the business pretty significantly when you have that greater transparency we believe there will many more financial advisors who will look to sell the non-trade product then there they have been before. You know also if you think back to just a recent Wall Street Journal article the non-traded space given the success of many programs most of which have been led by the management here in at Cole have also resulted in strong sales and we think that they will continue under the new proposed rules.
Chris Lucas – Capital One Securities: Okay, and then just kind of picking up on an earlier question as it relates to the number of advisers that you are currently utilizing other than the Cole sort of program. How does that compare to the number of advisers that Cole had sort of before the merger?
Lisa Beeson: So the way to think about this is Chris is it’s a ramp-up so, it’s not like we are now at that level at same we are continuing to pursue selling agreements. There are many underway, there will several that will be following the LPL signed agreements. So our objective is to be at the same levels just to where Cole was at its end point, so Cole ultimately had 80,000 financial advisers in its network for Cole 5 – excuse for Cole 4 we anticipate being ultimately at the same level for Cole 5 so, it’s just a matter of time and getting more selling agreements in space.
Chris Lucas – Capital One Securities: Okay, great. And last question for me just one the deal flow that sort of came through in the second quarter and is under contract or has already closed this quarter excluding Red Lobster can you sort of give us a breakdown of what the off market versus fully marketed was?
Lisa Beeson: Those numbers I gave you excluded Red Lobster actually.
Chris Lucas – Capital One Securities: Okay, great.
Lisa Beeson: So the numbers that I read out were excluding Red Lobster.
Chris Lucas – Capital One Securities: Sure, thanks appreciate it.
David Kay: Thanks Chris.
Operator: And next question is Jonathan Pong, Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Hi, good morning guys. Just kind of following-up on Chris question there. Can you characterize on the acquisition you have closed on or under contract close on after quarter end outside of Red Lobster what percentage of those are retail investment grade and then what’s the average lease term on those?
David Kay: Jonathan, we don’t have the detail on what percentage are investment grade and what percentage are not but we can certainly get back to you with that. Overall, percentages on a pro forma basis including Red Lobster and the sale of centers will be a 46% investment grade so, that not significant different from we were in the past quarter. Percentages have been roughly in line with that considering Red Lobster is such a large piece of non-investment grade obviously considerable portion of the rest of it was to make up for that difference to remain at about 46%.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Sure, makes sense. And then I think back at NAREIT you had mentioned some of your peers were still interested in some of the Red Lobster assets that you of course have since closed on. Can you update us on whether those discussions are ongoing and if so you know are big are we talking about here?
David Kay: You know I mean a part of the reason that Lisa and Brian and our team structured the deal the way that we did in terms of individual master leases of size so, that we would have the opportunity at some point in the future to have flexibility with those in terms of selling them or what have you JV and then et cetera. We have a tremendous amount of reverse enquiry from some of our peers from some companies that are just interested in buying because they know the credit well or they attended Golden Gates bank meeting or have a better understanding maybe of what the future of Red Lobster holds then the general public might not have some of that information. I would say in the time being having just closed yesterday we think that the credit will continue to become more visible to the public and Golden Gate tremendous partner we are very excited to part with Josh and his team and I think that you know on a go forward basis you will see the credit continue to be enhanced by both the synergies by the former management coming in and by the massive amounts of improvements that the stores have that are just not sorting to realize some of the returns. I think that there will be an arbitrage obviously between what we bought it for because we bought all in on peace and what we would potentially sell pieces at I’d say that will continue to evaluate those enquires and offers but we have nothing right now on the board that we would see in monetizing in the next quarter or so.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Thanks for that that’s helpful and then last question just sort of on financing strategy going forward. Looking into ‘15 as you fill your revolver with acquisitions how are you guys thinking about when it makes sense to come back for long-term financing there on the unsecured side of the equity side is there a margin of safety you’re thinking about whether it’s 25%, 30% capacity remained in revolver how are you thinking about when it make sense to clear that out to preserve flexibility?
David Kay: I mean we continue to see pretty low rates and nothing in the very foreseeable future in terms of uptick. There however is always uncertainty and that was part of the reason heading into the summer behind the equity offering. We like our leverage profile prospects at the end of year being in the low to mid sixes, where we have sort of penciled that out. That’s over a turn less and where we had talked to the rating agencies about when we were rated Triple B minus so we feel very confident that we have significantly de-risked the balance sheet. I think in terms of towards the end of the year you’ll see us do a larger bond offering, part of what we offer because of the scale that maybe some of the other just recent general haven’t is liquidity in the bond market. last year it was 2.55 billion when you start to get north of the billion dollars in the bond market it attracted different investor, you’re able to provide a different level of liquidity for them and I think the best attractive from a pricing perspective ultimately for us. So I think you’ll see us towards the end of the year. We may have some rates so that we can lock in some of the treasuries now but we feel pretty confident that yields should stay pretty low. And I’d say that we should have a very-very good following for bond offering that we do and hopefully pricing will be tight because I think that our metrics look more like a mid-triple B company then they do a triple B minus and because again at the liquidity and not being a debut issue or anymore I think that we should have very-very attractive type pricing.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird & Co.: All right thanks David.
David Kay: Thank you Jonathan.
Operator: Our next question is Paul Adornato from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Paul Adornato – BMO Capital Markets: Thanks good morning.
David Kay: Good morning Paul.
Paul Adornato – BMO Capital Markets: Hi just a follow up on your last comment are there any metrics in your understanding that the rating agencies want to see improve before you’re eligible for an upgrade or…
David Kay: No, I don’t think so our fixed charge coverage ratio has been one of the biggest movers for us. We’re at north of three times, which is pretty much the highest or at least comparable to any other peers and they are all rated triple B or triple B plus. We’ve seen two companies recently move within our peer group, one to triple B plus that’s at low six times and one to triple B minus although somewhat split rated, two of the three agencies haven’t triple B minus. We’ve the biggest pool of unencumbered assets and the most flexibility for sure biggest amount of – largest amount of liquidity in terms of our line. I’d say the only thing that the rating agencies can point is to seasoning and I think what we continue to remind them as well as the rest of the market is that our team of acquisition, due diligence, accounting, finance has all been with this company for very long time, just in pieces. The guys who ran Cap Lease and who ran Trust REIT and who ran Cole and who ran ARCP are all still in place. Most of those people have been there seven, eight, 10 years who are running the same jobs. Some of those were CEOs of those companies that are now running huge divisions of ours. Same management, same folks who acquired under-wrote and asset managed all of our assets, and so I think what we need to do and our job is to continue to educate the agencies on why this thing is already seasoned and the rest of the equity markets frankly. This isn’t a put together and we hired 425 new people., these people have been in place running these same properties for a very-very long time and we need to educate them, but educate the rest of the world as well.
Operator: The next question is from Dan Donlan of Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Thank you and good morning.
David Kay: Good morning Dan.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: David just wanted to go through the guidance real quick, just so I understand it the pro forma AFFO run rate at year end 2014 you have 1.18 to 1.20. That implies a quarterly run rate of $0.295 to $0.30 that’s not a run rate for the fourth quarter is it, is that what would be call it at the very end of the quarter for the first quarter, assuming for the first quarter of ‘15 assuming nothing new to ‘15, is that right?
David Kay: That is correct, other than for Cole Capital that would assume the same estimates for 2015 as we have estimated for 2014. So yes that would be a year end run rate but would assume the same $4.9 billion of assets acquired during 2015 as well as the same $3.1 billion of equity raised in the Cole Capital managed funds.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay so what percentage of…
David Kay: There is no growth in Cole Capital in those numbers at all, it’s just an even split with what this year is.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Well that sounds, that’s kind of my question, so how much of that is Cole Capital of that, $0.295 to $0.30?
David Kay: Same estimates of this year where this year’s estimates were a $120 million of EBITDA but on a full year basis it would be $140 million because we only owned Cole Capital this year about 10.5 months.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay alright perfect. So then I guess if I’m looking at the other guidance range you bought that you reiterated the one for full year ‘14, $1.13 to a $1.19 I think the midpoint of that is $1.16 so you’ve done $0.49 year-to-date I guess that would imply about $0.335 in third quarter and fourth quarter to get to that midpoint is that right as well?
David Kay: That is roughly yes, the math. And the reason there being is again is that most of the Cole Capital EBITDA will occur with the acquisitions in the capital – in Cole Capital versus where we were at the first two quarters of the year. It’s a very steep ramp up as you know.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Yes, and so you probably have a benefit from ARCM not being full potentially in to the first part of the fourth quarter as well?
David Kay: That’s exactly right because as articulated in that and part of reason why we really wanted to lay that out it’s because you’ll have Red Lobster and Arc Centers being owned for the three months period roughly both at the same time. And that’s why we try to be transparent and give both numbers, give the AFFO run rate so that you’ll see the difference of actually centers coming out as well as the year with both centers and Lobster in at the same period of time.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay got you.
David Kay: Just to know one other thing also in the estimate there is no promotes or one-time disposition fees in any of the Cole numbers, either in the AFFO run rate that we gave of the $1.18 to a $1.24 and the $1.13 to $1.19 range where we reconcile to a $1.14.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Right, okay and I guess since we’re almost through July how is the capital raising for the funds looking relative to your guidance? I don’t have that presentation in front of me I can’t remember the number, it might have been 125 if memory serves me correctly.
David Kay: It’s our guidance is fairly close I would say that we are slightly behind but because LPL came on last week and we’ll come on this week with the other fund we’re still very confident in $3.1 billion. We’re not making any adjustments to that at all.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Right and both those funds have broken escrow there, right so I mean I think that’s probably pretty….
Lisa Beeson: Yeah long time ago.
David Kay: Yes a while back, and we’ve actually brought a significant number of properties in them.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay all right thank you for that. Just kind of moving on to the Cole margins. They came in substantially higher than I would anticipate, not that I hadn’t heard a forecast or anything but the 60% NOI margins were fairly high relative to kind of years past and I think obviously the fact there’s a lot of AUM fees in that is helping as not as much capital raising but would you expect that margin to come down kind of in the next couple of quarters as the capital raising accelerates?
David Kay: You’re exactly right, we had higher assets, higher acquisitions, lower capital raising and low commissions. So you’re exactly right that’ll start to turn as you start to buy, raise more capital you’ll have higher commissions and then the assets will have a led out. So you’re right, margins will come in.
Operator: Our next question – our final question is from Steve [Manaca], Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks, good morning. Quick question on the FFO to AFFO for Cole Capital your other amortization, depreciation is about $24.6 million. What is that – what assets are you amortizing or depreciating in the Cole Capital balance sheet?
David Kay: I’ll let Brain answer that.
Brian Block: Yeah, good morning it’s – relating to the intangible assets we acquired not only the hard assets on the Cole side but we have whole set intangible assets that we were required to amortize as well that are broken in the financial statements notes of our 10-Q.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks and other question is the Cole Capital G&A typically the run rate going for the second-half of the year is about $100 million assuming roughly about $20 million of EBITDA for the first-half. I just want to get a sense that so, going through 2015 when you were talking about Cole Capital on the run rate of a $1.18 to $1.20 for AFFO to reassume the similar ramp in ‘15 for ‘14 with the Cole Capital business?
David Kay: Yeah, yes, I would say yes. I could be more level again in ‘15 we’ve assumed no growth at all in that just flat same as this year but yes it should ramp similarly.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you very much.
David Kay: Thank you. Thank you everyone for your questions. I just wanted to thank everybody for joining us today.

Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the American Realty Capital Properties First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Barney Rosen of ARCP. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Corporate Participant: Thank you Gary. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review American Realty Capital Properties First quarter 2014 earnings report. Joining me today are Nicholas S. Schorsch, Chairman and CEO; David Kay, President; Brian Block, Chief Financial Officer and Lisa Beeson, Chief Operating Officer. This afternoon’s call is being webcast on our website at arcpreit.com in the investor relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at 4pm Eastern Time today. Dial in for the replay is 18773447529 with the confirmation code of 10044445. Before I turn the call over to Nick, I would like to remind everyone that statements in this earnings call which are not historical facts will be forward looking. ARCP’s actual results may differ materially from these forward looking statements and the risk factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC report. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports, ARCP disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward looking statements except as expressly required by law. Let me quickly review the format of today’s call. First, Nick will comment on the quarter then David will discuss the closing of our recent acquisition Cole Capital, the recently announced spin-off of our multi-tenant business ARCentres as well as the future opportunities we see for the business. Brian will then review our operating results for the quarter, detail our execution on several strategic balance sheet initiatives and walk through our earnings guidance for 2014. Lisa will then provide an update on the integration and synergies of our operations across our businesses as well as possible larger scale opportunities we see in the market. Now I would like to turn the call over to ARCP’s Chairman and CEO, Nicholas S. Schorsch.
Nicholas Schorsch: Thank you Barney. Good afternoon everyone. Let me make a couple of key points on the quarter and on the business before I turn the call over to David. Our portfolio acquisitions were extremely strong with $1.75 billion closed and in our pipeline. Our team is performing as planned with cash cap rates of approximately 8% on these acquisitions and GAAP cap rates of nearly 8.25. our first quarter earnings came in exactly where we expected at $0.26 per share of AFFO, despite the fact that there was less revenue due to the timing of the Cole closing, we are confident with our guidance for the full year of 2014 of $0.13 to $0.19 per share and a forward quarterly run rate of $0.29 to $0.30 per share. We are realizing the identified $74 million of annual savings from the synergies identified in the merger and our singular focus and [Inaudible] business coupled with Cole Capital provides our shareholders with both a stable and durable income while creating opportunities for dynamic growth within our platform. Finally I continue to be extremely pleased with how the management team has developed a cohesive working relationship. In fact we anticipate accelerating the succession planning process for David to take the rein to CEO of the company in the near future. With that, I would like to turn the call over to David.
David Kay: Thank you Nick and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased with the progress we have made on acquisitions and capital raising. And I am excited about the opportunities we see going forward for the business. We invested over billion dollars of real estate on the balance sheet during the first quarter inclusive of the previously announced Fortress and Inland portfolios at a cash cap rate of 8.02% and a GAAP cap rate of 8.24%. These included 224 properties comprised of 78 individual transactions. In addition we have closed and/or have under contract over 700 million in real estate for the second quarter. Together first quarter acquisitions with our projected second quarter acquisitions were totaled $1.75 billion at an average cap rate of 8.26% and a cash cap rate of 7.92% and a weighted average lease term of about 10 years. This puts us firmly on track for achieving our previously stated guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion of self-originated balance sheet acquisitions for the year. In addition to our self-originated acquisitions, we are currently in negotiations to acquire several large corporate sell lease back portfolios which could materialize in the future. Let me now turn to Cole Capital. Looking at our capital raising results, Cole Capital raised approximately $900 million during the first quarter putting us firmly on pace to achieve our previously discussed $3.1 billion capital raise target for 2014. During the quarter we successfully closed out two non-traded funds and subsequently launched two successor funds. Typically the non-traded funds have a fund raising ramp up period in the beginning stages of the fund’s life cycle as we obtain selling agreements with broker dealers. We have made great progress with obtaining these agreements. During the quarter, we completed the capital raise CCPT 4 which focuses on retail with over $2.9 billion of equity raised. We currently have three funds in total raising capital. Capital raising for non-traded REITs is cyclical by nature with a majority of the capital being raised as the program matures. During the quarter, our acquisitions team acquired $420 million of real estate on behalf of our managed REITs comprising 84 properties and 51 individual transactions. Inclusive of the balance sheet acquisitions I just mentioned, our total acquisitions for the quarter were $1.45 billion comprised of 308 properties in a 129 individual transactions, that’s roughly an average purchase price of $11 million per transaction which as what I have been describing as one of our competitive advantages. We can buy an up-market smaller transactions which have far less competition and better cap rates, ultimately yielding better spread to the company. Lisa will discuss the overall portfolio in greater detail but I will say that I am pleased with the progress we have made on the acquisitions front, as well as to growing diversity and quality of the portfolio. Now, let me quickly give you update on our previously announced multi-tenant spin-off ARCenters. We are on target for a mid-June close. We continue to believe this transaction will unlock value for our shareholders. The assets continue to perform very well and believe represents a very solid foundation for growing this platform. Upon the completion of the spin-off ARCP will be focused on our core net lease strategy. ARCenters as a new standalone and publically traded company listed on NASDAQ will focus on growth and consolidation opportunities that exist within the multi-tenant sector. I’d like to now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial results for the quarter and our future objectives.
Brian Block: Thank you David and thanks to the participants joining today’s call. In addition to reviewing our results for the first quarter I’ll also discuss the strategic initiatives we have undertaken to strengthen our balance sheet. Let me remind everyone, that given the timing of the ARC Trust IV as well as the Cole closing first quarter results include just under two months of the collectivities and almost the full quarter of ARC Trust IV. Revenues for the first quarter were approximately $321 million and AFFO was a $147.4 million for the quarter or $0.26 per share fully dilutive. The year-over-year increases were due to the various acquisitions consummated over the past 12 months. Our current run rate based on AFFO per share fully diluted is between $0.29 and $0.30. We made a lot of progress improving our balance sheet on multiple front store during the quarter. Specifically we reduced our overall cost of borrowings as well as our secured debt, lengthened our debt maturities and improved balance sheet flexibility. One of our stated objectives was to continue to lengthen term which we will continue to do. For example, during the quarter we successfully added long-term debt to the mix when we secured $1.2 billion of ten year fixed rate interest only financing consisting of $693 million of mortgage debt and $500 million of senior unsecured notes. In addition, we successfully refinanced $730 million of secured mortgage financing. We used proceeds received from our five year unsecured note offering to replace this two year debt. We also used proceeds from our three notes to pay off roughly $1.3 billion on the whole credit facility which had a one year maturity. As of the end of the quarter our weighted average interest rate was 3.7% which includes our line of credit with a weighted average maturity of 5.7 years. This compares favorably when compare to our peers which have an average maturity of 5.9 years and an average debt cost of 4.8%. Increasing our borrowing capacity is another area where we are making significant progress. We have been in negotiation with our lenders to upsize our credit facility in excess of our current 3.15 billion capacity and have received verbal commitments from our largest lenders as well as from new relationships. These efforts will further improve our liquidity and provide additional flexibility. With that I am going to turn the call over to Lisa.
Lisa Beeson: Thanks Brian. Looking at the net lease portfolio at the end of the quarter our occupancy remains at 99%; 51% of the portfolio tenancy is rated investment grade and an additional 20% is rated. As a reminder these are actual rated entities and not shadow ratings or parent ratings. We expect the portfolio to generate growth of 1.2% before taking in account CPI based escalators or percentage rents. These statistics exclude ARCenters, the multi-tenant portfolio that we will spin-off later this quarter. Over the past four months, we have successfully integrated over 300 individuals from the multiple entities into one cohesive enterprise. Our accounting systems are fully integrated as well. We expect to exceed the previously announced 70 million in cost savings subsequent to the integration of the Cole platform. We anticipate 34 million in synergies to be recognized within the first six months following the close of the acquisition and an additional 40 million in the subsequent six months for an annual run rate of 74 million. We continue to explore ways to optimize our business to increase these synergies further. Now I wanted to cover ARCenters and the growth opportunity we see. We have a great portfolio. 78 properties with 11.7 square million feet, 96% occupied with 4.7% comp store NOI growth. We also have very strong household metrics with three mile population of 69,000 and household income of roughly 70,000. As a result of our spin-off announcement in form 10 filing, we have had a lot of inquiry regarding potential transactions. There are currently 19 public companies in this space and 11 with an enterprise value of less than 3 billion. The G&A of these small public companies is roughly 100 basis points. Further there are many more private portfolios. The small cap companies are trading at 15.5 times AFFO multiple and the large caps are trading at 19.5 times. The ability to combine platforms and drive synergies is meaningful. Also our current structure makes conversations easier without creating social issues. By retaining the 25% interest in the company, we are aligned in creating shareholder value. With that I will turn it back to the operator to open it up for questions. Gary?
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions). And the first question comes from Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Paul Adornato – BMO Capital Markets: Hi Good afternoon.
Nicholas Schorsch: Good afternoon Paul.
Paul Adornato – BMO Capital Markets: Nick, earlier I guess a couple of months ago, you talked about the equity markets and the fact that you would not issue equity below I think you mentioned 14.50 or so. And so I was wondering given the opportunity set that you see before you, given current market conditions, can you give us an update on what you think an appropriate share price is to tap the equity markets, just to hear your thoughts?
Nicholas Schorsch: Sure. Paul, as I said before, we are not happy with where our stock price is trading right now. We think that there is a lot of value that will be unlocked in the next 30 to 45 days with the Spinco of our multitenant assets which will certainly drive value and the other side of it is, we are seeing some very interesting opportunities in the marketplace per transactions where cap rates are starting to back up. So we do take the stock price into consideration with any acquisitions. But to be clear, we are not anxious to issue stock at $12 or wherever it is at the moment or $13 or $13.5 a share, we think we are way undervalued and we think our currency is not being fairly viewed.
Paul Adornato – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, a related question, do you have a buy back in place?
Nicholas Schorsch: Yes we do.
Paul Adornato – BMO Capital Markets: And so what are your thoughts in terms of pulling the trigger there?
Nicholas Schorsch: We have not done so. We had a $250 million or $500 million; I am not sure what the exact amount is of our buy back, it’s been in place for quite a while. We haven’t executed anything on it in four, five or six months. Obviously it is something we have available to us if our stock continues to stay cheap. But we are also looking to delever our balance sheet overtime that would be inverse of buying back stock. So we don’t want to be delevering our balance sheet at the same time as, and buying back stock. We do think our stock is cheap. Now just to be very specific, on the first note, we as a management team have borrowed $2 million worth of stock in the last six weeks and probably will continue to buy stock at that level. Currently we are blacked out but we were actively buying stock to both in our common and in our preferred and we believe that’s the right thing for us to be doing with our own capital.
Brian Block: Paul, you can see also the cap rates that were achieved in the market place at north of 8%. So we are obviously, even though we are trading at the levels that we are trading there, significant accretion between where our shares are trading and the 8% that we are able to achieve in the market place.
Nicholas Schorsch: I would rather be a buyer of stock myself personally than have the company buying back the stock and levering up.
Paul Adornato – BMO Capital Markets: Okay, great. Finally Nick, I don’t follow all of your businesses very closely but maybe you could just provide an update on what’s happening in terms of consolidation of the broker dealer networks and how that might impact ARCP?
Nicholas Schorsch: Sure. The broker dealer space that we are, we have closed the deal to buy Cetera that deal did close about a week ago. So we have about 10,000 advisors in our system that directly is a positive on ARCP. ARCP sells some products on those platforms, not a lot but some. We continue to see very robust capital markets for our Cole Capital Markets business and that business continues to grow and our enthusiasm for the independent channel is no way [Inaudible] I know some of our peers have felt like that’s not that important of their business. It is an important part of our business. We expect to raise over $3.1 billion, this year David and Lisa and Brian and our teams have been actively working with the broker dealers. We’ve recently signed many, many big selling agreements outside of the group that are cap owns, broadening their distribution constantly, significantly broadening of one was this Cole and that area is expanding and that’s one of the things I mentioned in my comments. So we expect to see that Cole Capital will continue to be dynamic growth aspect of our business as well as our asset management revenue for years and years to come.
Paul Adornato – BMO Capital Markets: Okay great thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Jonathan Pong with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird: Hey good afternoon guys. Do you guys say, we are at a point right now where even though your past critical mass in terms of size or I guess because of the fact that your past critical mass in terms of size might [Inaudible] sensitive focus on the one off organic pipeline rather than pursuing these potentially large entity level deals especially given where stock price is today?
Nicholas Schorsch: Yes I mean that is where we’re focused. That’s what we have spoken about, I mean we obviously did a lot of transactions, we are achieving cap rates that are frankly that are north of where our peers are because of the way that we’re acquiring. We continue to look at larger sale leaseback opportunities and built to suit opportunities for the same reasons because we think that we know that we have opportunities there because of our scale, we can take down larger blocks of assets and really get better rates because our peers can’t really participate in that. And so we’re able to play at both ends of the spectrum. We’re clearly focused on those areas much more than we would be in the M&A front.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird: Okay and then is future M&A dependent on where your equity is trading at that point or I guess I am trying to get a sense of the level of discipline you would have if you are to get a multi-billion dollar deal?
Nicholas Schorsch: I mean at the end of the day, cost of capital is always your overriding factor and so we look at every single opportunity both in terms of granular acquisitions, in terms of sale lease backs, built to suit or M&A transactions with our cost of capital in mind. Our goal is ultimately to deleverage the balance sheet and continue to do so. And so obviously that’s an important factor as well. As we continue to look forward into the future and look at opportunities we will evaluate each of them on an independent basis trying to obviously add accretion each time. And that takes our cost of capital in the place and the factor as well as how we want to deleverage.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird: Okay. And just a last question for me, for your year to date acquisitions; can you give us a sense of what percentage of those have grown your cash flow?
Lisa Beeson: Very few of them as a percentage there were a couple embedded in our portfolio that we acquired via Fortress but those were all bankable ground leases but otherwise there are no ground leases associated with the acquisition.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird: Great that’s helpful. Thanks a lot.
Nicholas Schorsch: Thank you Jon.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Lucas with Capital One. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas – Capital One: Good afternoon everyone. David or Nick may be to start this way. Can you give me a sense as to of the acquisitions you guys closed already year to date? What’s the composition by property type retail versus the industrial and office?
David Kay: Let Lisa answer that because she has the schedule sitting right in front of us.
Lisa Beeson: Sure. So you know as I look at first and second quarter about 30% is retail on the single tenant with some on the multi-tenant, 5% on the multi-tenant perspective and the remainder was in office and industrial and 16% office and 41% industrial.
Chris Lucas – Capital One: Okay. And then I guess.
David Kay: When we say industrial we mean distribution, these are non-industrial buildings. So I don’t want to confuse, people use these terms very loosely, we don’t do industrial so we are doing to either built to suit some of these built to suit where we’ve built the building like the Nissan or the M&M, Mars facility and some of these are Home Depot or FedEx distribution facility. And if you look at some our peers they will use that almost in literal retail because the users, the retail user like Kohl’s or like CDS or an Amazon and they will call it retail, it’s really distribution. So we don’t do industrial so it’s industrial, retail and office.
Chris Lucas – Capital One: Okay. And then it relates to the amount that is either closed or under contract for – Is the entire amount expected to close in the second quarter or is there some risk that?
David Kay: Yes. Yeah what we’ve laid out is all expected to close with a high degree of confidence during the second quarter.
Nicholas Schorsch: And more that’s just what we have as of today. So that’s not – that will certainly be a lower number than where we expect to be.
Lisa Beeson: And it also does not include longer built to suit type programs where they are expected to close into the third and fourth quarter.
Nicholas Schorsch: Nor does it include anything for the non-traded REITs.
Chris Lucas – Capital One: Well that’s good Nick trying to understand. So the CCPT tender, the acquisition that’s depending on that is not included in these numbers?
Lisa Beeson: Actually that is included in here. That transaction is included in here, a couple of $100 million associated with it is included that should be closing concurrent with the expiration of the tender in the middle of May.
David Kay: But it’s on the balance sheet it’s not going into a non-traded REIT.
Brian Block: When Nick was referring to with assets being acquired into the non-traded REITs are not included in that numbers. So these numbers that we are giving are just what’s going on to the balance sheet.
Chris Lucas – Capital One: Okay. And then just on the, just out of curiosity about many thing, one asset that did not close and have not expected to close the Inland portfolio seems extremely large, what was it?
David Kay: AT&T, it was a large facility in Atlanta and it is in St. Louis and it was a building that AT&T in the middle of due diligence noticed they were vacant.
Chris Lucas – Capital One: Okay. And then the last question for me. It is just may if you could give us an update on a built to suite business and how the progress is moving on deals on that front?
David Kay: It’s been actually very strong and I think one of the advantages that we’ve had is the size of our company we are able to talk to other big corporates as a peer now. When you go to present a build to suit as a take out, we are not doing construction or construction lending; this is purely take out positions. We now have the size and scale to really talk to the big corporates as a peer, we’re also many of these company’s largest landlord already. And so progress is going very well. We have a team of guys who are working on, going out and visiting those corporate, talking to the CFO’s and the guys who run the real estate groups within the big corporations, we’ve made a lot of progress, our pipeline right now is about $800 million. The closing of those typically takes 12 to 24 months depending on the type of facility that it is, but we as Nick mentioned we’ve done some really great deals with FedEx, Amazon, Mars, ConAgra many of the big names that you would want to see, good credits.
Chris Lucas – Capital One: And so are those deals included in sort of the acquisition flow or is there a separate view on those?
David Kay: The ones that are included in the acquisitions flow are really from a pipeline perspective would be in their future forecast. In the numbers that we’ve given closing in the second quarter or under contract to close in the second quarter, we may have A, built to suite or two in there that is being completed during that quarter. But one that was by example initiated during this quarter that won’t close for 18 months that’s nowhere sort of in our numbers right now, it’s just in our future pipeline of deals.
Chris Lucas – Capital One: Okay Great. Thanks a lot guys.
David Kay: Thanks Chris.
Operator: The next question comes from Mitch Germain with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Mitch Germain – JMP Securities: Hey guys. So it looks like private capital fund raising slowed in March. You know David what’s that attributed to?
David Kay: You know as we’ve said on the call, we initiated two new funds and there is really a ramp up period where you are going to obtain selling agreements of the broker dealers. During that period you are not raising as much capital, most of the capital in these funds is actually raised as the fund matures and towards the back end where there is sort of this rush to get dollars. And so this is fairly typical, we actually put out of free writing perspectives that showed where Cole Capital raises have been in the past and you can track those with the launches of the fund. So as we closed out two funds and replaced those with two new products, you’ll see that now selling agreements are ramping up, we’ve got 9,000, 10,000 advisors and certain ones now and as we continue to get selling agreements that will ramp up and then dollars will come in. And so again we are in our view we are right on track to the numbers that we have forecasted for full capital and we remain confident that we’ll hit those.
Nicholas Schorsch: Mitch we are actually we are probably a month ahead of where we expected to be for example, CCPT which was the Cole Credit 2 is now raising almost $2.5 million a day from the standing start less than 2.5 months ago. So that’s a very rapid ramp up and that’s partially because of what we talked about it earlier was the diversification of the Cole platform. Cole is a lot more diversified than it used to be, it used to sell primarily through about a 130 broker dealers, now it’s more like a 160. So that’s helping ramp up that sales efforts, and the first quarter was much better because those deals closed out quicker. So it’s really, it all averages out in the total for the year.
Mitch Germain – JMP Securities: Great and then sorry...
David Kay: Well I was just going to say we are very pleased with how Cole capital is operating. Management is doing a great job out there, the wholesalers are doing a terrific job and they’ve really been operating better than expected as Nick said.
Mitch Germain – JMP Securities: And then on that top how would you characterize the Cole team in general?
David Kay: You know I would characterize them as fully integrated and obviously very capable of performing what they are supposed to do. They had a great business before the merger, we’ve continued to sort of refine how we do certain things. From an underwriting perspective they are world class. From an acquisition perspective, they were as dominant as ARCP and so the two teams collectively you see the acquisition results, I mean I think that they speak for themselves to some extent we’ve done an awful lot of transactions, we’re obtaining the cap rates that we have slated to obtain and we are not stretching. We’ve underwritten nearly $10 billion of deals in the first quart and the billion and a half that we’ve closed and have under contract to close in the next quarter is a pretty typical sort of percentage. And the team is operating very well. Our accounting systems are fully integrated as Lisa mentioned and we couldn’t be more pleased. We are spending a lot of time in Phoenix from the management perspective and I think that that’s a good thing. We have I think a rejuvenated intensity there that Cole frankly had not seen in probably past year or two and I think that the work product and the effort is directly related to the results that we are achieving.
Nicholas Schorsch: Hey Mitch as one of the thing you have to look at and that is that, look at the results, when you look at the performance of David and Lisa’s teams and how they are performing as far as buying, the velocity these are 1Z, 2Z, I don’t know or was it 380 properties David, with over 90 transactions. There is no other peer in this industry that’s putting up eight caps with investment grade assets with nine and 10 year durations in this kind of tonnage. I mean this is big value and this is 1.7 billion in four months and that includes two months we were shut down in January and February, we were in the middle of the merger. So besides the merger with all the things that we have been going on, they put up a 1.7 billion of assets and cap rates that are 100 wide at industry standards. All I can say is it’s the reason why I feel that our succession planning is moving ahead of schedule. That’s the exact reason, it did not show right there, it’s just their fee, they performing exemplary.
Mitch Germain – JMP Securities: Great. I appreciate that Nick. And then David just some thoughts on the sale leaseback opportunities, is there specific industry or a sector that that’s skewing toward?
David Kay: No, I mean, we like retail, I mean that’s been the bulk of the portfolio at roughly 50% or so and I think that we will continue to be focused on that, there is a lot of opportunity there. And retail as you know stands across everything from quick service restaurants, restaurants to bread and butter retail. And so I think we are seeing it across that entire platform and we have, we are the landlord to a lot of major companies as I said. And so I think that the dialogue that we have now with our size is vastly different than it was a year ago. And it’s a different company, our capabilities are different, we can execute, we talked about last quarter we brought a lot of the diligence and the legal underwriting, et cetera in house, we have a full team of attorneys that do our work, so that we can not only control the timing of it, but the quality of it. And I think that’s been attractive for a lot of corporations who are working to do leasebacks. I think you are going to see higher rates in that as well because there is not a lot of companies that can pull down $300 million, $500 million, $1 billion type transactions with single products and because of our skill, we can do that now.
Mitch Germain – JMP Securities: Great. Thanks guys.
David Kay: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Daniel Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Thank you and good afternoon.
David Kay: Hi Dan.
Nicholas Schorsch: Hi Dan.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Hi. I guess first question for Brian on the G&A I think is about 49 million, how much of that was related to Cole and then kind of what are you expecting for that line item going forward for rest of year, should we see that start to take down a little bit or how should that, how is that going to progress?
Brian Block: Yeah Dan. I would point out that we view Cole Capital as a different segment of business. So I think we have pretty good transparency in the footnotes specific to the real estate versus Cole Capital. So if you parse through the G&A and I am turning toward right now, you would see that roughly see here $20 million of the total G&A relates to the fund raising business and the balance is to the real estate. How I see that trending is to the extent we are raising more capital in subsequent quarters, there is a direct correlation to additional G&A vis-à-vis conditions and variable cost that are directly relating to the selling activities.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay. So you anticipate kind of this run rate to kind of kick up from here a little bit?
Brian Block: No, I would say it goes down in general as we are realizing the synergies that we spoke about earlier. But my only point is when we are successful with the fund raising whether it’s the end of second quarter, the third quarter, I don’t want to use this as a trend right now because the variable cost that hit the G&A directly relating to the sales will increase G&A overall.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay. Yeah. I can remember that with Cole, and we had a lot of companies report today, so I am sorry I missed that footnote. And then the second question is kind of on the credit facility, I noticed that your spread to LIBOR is I think it’s almost 300 basis points. But was kind of curious why that seems to be so high relative to some of your peers, is it just the share of magnitude and then kind of going forward, what’s your anticipation for paying that down, what type of debt maturities are you looking to pair that down with as you bring more acquisitions onto the balance sheet?
Brian Block: Dan you are referring to the older revolver, now we have the new revolver. And revolver itself is 140 over and the term loan is 160 over. So that’s been, that’s already been updated when we increase the facility to 3.15 billion those new terms went into play.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay. That makes a lot more sense then. But as far as...
Brian Block: And they don’t ratchet anymore, so you won’t have them in a higher rate as the leverage rates are flat.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay. As far as the 2.4, what do you, do you think about putting more on the credit facility as you get more lenders in there or what is your thought process on terming that out?
Brian Block: Yeah I mean our thought is to go back to the bond market I think we did a large bond deal 2.55 billion last time, there needs to be some space in between, rates are very attractive right now, on the long term side we will keep the next deal towards the longer end of the curve. You are seeing some of our peers issue 10 year paper, 30 year papers being done, there is a nice sweet spot on some sevens too which fits nicely into our maturity schedule. So we will term it out. I think that we want to do issuances as we have said previously of the larger variety, airing on the side of 700 million to a billion, maybe just north of a $1 billion. And so you should see that as we progress, we are looking to upsize the line that does not – that’s not just to go ahead and load it up, it’s really to provide ourselves with more flexibility and more liquidity which I think the agencies like. I know the agencies like that and I also think that it gives us a lot more flexibility when we are looking at sale leaseback transactions or things of that sort. So we will continue to term out the debt in the bond market, I think we just want to do it at a measured pace with a little space in between your deals. And so we just recently did a deal so we need to be patient but you will see hit the market hopefully a good time.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay makes complete sense. And then moving to Cole Capital, I remember when you guys acquired it and you talked a lot about how AR Capital had relationships in the broker deal world and Cole Capital had relationships that maybe you guys didn’t have. Was just kind of curious is that falling into place in terms of getting new relationships and specifically do you have selling agreements with LPL as well as an AIR price?
Brian Block: Yeah. Let me answer the first part of the question first which is yes, that is bearing fruit I mean there were some crossovers but many not and we are getting selling agreements with ones that we had not had before – we did not have.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Did not have a merit price?
Brian Block: Right, we did not have a merit price and previously we do, we are working with LPL, we just recently got Linking as an example. And so it is progressing very nicely and as I said before we couldn’t be more pleased with the management that’s there in working hard and the wholesalers are doing a good job and we continue to see ramp up in the funds. And so I know that there was question I received a couple of emails based on the [Inaudible] reported whereas the volume, this is very typical, this business and you would see cyclicality and particularly at the launch of the funds. And so you will start to see ramp ups and again as the funds start to mature, you will a lot of dollars come in. And so we are just approaching this as we have any other year and we are very, very comfortable with the funds we have outlined as our guidance to raise.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay. So Cole Capital is selling on a merit price but they are not selling LPL?
Brian Block: No, vice versa, Cole Capital has never sold on a merit price.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay.
Brian Block: And it is selling on, it is continuing to sell as it was before on LPL, no change.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay. Yeah. Okay. That’s the largest...
Brian Block: It also is broadening, the third thing you asked is also correct, it is broadening its distribution to more broker dealers it did not have before as expected, so the number of broker dealers itself there is probably in large part by 30.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay. I will [Inaudible] fire, the sirens are
Brian Block: It’s an ambulance on Park Avenue.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: All right. And then two more questions sorry. On the – as far as the acquisition side, you raised 880 million in private capital, you only put 420 million to work, why not try to match that better, why not add more properties to the non-traded versus the balance sheet in order to time it more appropriately?
Lisa Beeson: Go ahead David.
David Kay: I was just going to say the acquisitions are there I mean they’re teed up, it just takes a little while, some of those are built to suit and there is an allocation process but the acquisitions are there, so it is more of a timing issue but you will see the acquisitions flow into those bonds over the next quarter or so.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay. And then lastly Nick you have a seven year agreement with ARCP as CEO. Was just kind of curious why the discussed success plans is, is that something you would go back and change the agreement or how should we think about that, given that you only signed it just a couple of months ago?
Nicholas Schorsch: No, that was always a part of my agreement Dan. I think we have discussed this before in the call you may not have been on. But my contract was to be Chairman, the Executive Chairman of the firm from the very beginning and that I was going to be Interim CEO and that’s the way my contract is written and the idea was that I would stay in place and dedicate a substantial majority of my time through the point of which we had a deep bench in the C suite and we wanted to have a more robust bench then a company of $4 billion or $5 billion which would have been I guess almost any one of the four people we have now sitting in the C suite. And the idea was that overtime we would be, I would be able to take a more of the role of a Chairman and allocate capital no different than what you see with Mort Zuckerman or with Sam Zell or what you see with John Malone and that was always the construct of my contract and David was brought in Lisa and Brian and then Rich as part of the board’s concept from the very beginning It was always contemplated that we needed a very robust management team to run a company of this size, realize we are almost double the size of our newest peer and we are doing more than double the amount of acquisition than our newest peer is doing. So, we look at as part of the process. So, at this point we are seeing very good results and I wanted to be clear with the market that at our current pace we had originally hoped to be in a position to start the transition in early ‘15 we may be able to start the transition even sooner than that.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay, well hopefully that means you are still going to stay in the calls, they won’t be the same without you.
Nicholas Schorsch: I won’t leave, don’t worry. And I am not selling my stock either.
Dan Donlan – Ladenburg Thalmann: Thank you.
Nicholas Schorsch: Thanks Dan.
Operator: The next question comes is a follow-up from Paul Adornato with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Paul Adornato – BMO Capital Markets: Thanks. Sorry if I missed this Lisa, could you talk about where the incremental cost savings are coming from?
Lisa Beeson: Sure, so it’s a combination of streamlining a bunch of the organization a lot of it is the elimination of the duplication of sort of joint corporate expenses, there is also a lot of very expensive people who are no longer part of the company on a go forward basis that’s another sizable advisable portion of the saving but it really is coming across the board from third-party service providers you know paying closer attention to expenses given the knowledge that we have on the Cole Capital side, it really is all the process aboard. Auditors, board fees, I mean it’s all of those kind of expenses that we are able to drive the expenses down.
Paul Adornato – BMO Capital Markets: Great, thank you very much.
David Kay: Thanks Paul.
Operator: The next question comes from Bradley Teets with Kovack Securities. Please go ahead.
Bradley Teets – Kovack Securities: Thank you. When you structured the spin-off of the centers property, do you consider the reason for doing that more to break up income versus growth properties or just to have the pure triple net lease in the original ARCP and the multi-tenant in the new spin-off?
David Kay: I think it’s a combination it’s ARCP will become a pure play net lease durable income company, growth in that company will as Nick pointed and I pointed out earlier is in the 1.5% sort of internal range and then additional growth from Cole Capital. We see the spin-off as the multi-tenant grouping a higher growth as we pointed as Lisa pointed is over 4.5% same store comp, trades at a different multiple, there is lots of consolidation opportunities as she pointed out earlier and I think it’s really the combination of creating value for our shareholder as well as becoming a single focused net lease pure play company which I think is something that the market should embrace.
Bradley Teets – Kovack Securities: Thank you.
David Kay: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from [Panos Marcolas with Helenica]. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Good afternoon gentlemen.
Nicholas Schorsch: Good afternoon.
Unidentified Analyst: I have two very simple questions probably related, first question is in the issue how the market comparing ARCP to Realty Income it seems like ARCP is getting short end of the stake. My concern is what is management doing to achieve a more favorable comparison and at what stage will we see the valuation levels from the market where to put into street terms when are going to get any respect?
David Kay: You know it’s an excellent question in fact on the last call somebody asked where are the things that are happening better than expected or sooner than excepted and what are the ones that are happening at a slower rate and my answer was, the markets embracing our company is definitely coming at a slower pace. We spend a lot of time on the road talking to dedicated refunds talking to investors potential investors and I think you know one of the things hopefully that this quarter will do is really clarify and simplify the story, sure we had a partial quarter because of the acquisitions that we have made during the first quarter but I think this is really a true – you are seeing a true run-rate now for what we do. You are not seeing any major acquisition added to this, you are seeing the granular deals that we have talked about and are executing and the cap rates that we are able to achieve. Our debt levels are really the only state that I can point to that isn’t the same or better than every other as a peer. And I would say that hopefully with time obviously we will bring in our leverage and we have talked about that for the last two quarters now and we will continue to work towards that. We will focus on our blocking and tackling which is the basic buying at good cap rates and buying the right assets, keeping our mix and majority of investment grade and hopefully the market will respond with getting on the road. Many have suggested maybe you should go out and issue equity and it will give some of these REIT funds and some of the other investors a chance to buy stock and that might actually move your stock in an upward trajectory. I think the answer to that is we are only going to issue equity in accretive manner when we have deals, we don’t like our stock price right now as Nick said. I don’t love it in the 13’s more or less in the 12’s. We trade at a couple of 100 basis point yield differential from a dividend perspective, we trade at multiples below where our peers are. We are just going to keep doing the same things that we are doing in executing and getting out there and telling the story and hopefully the market will respond. We are not running a stock, we are running the company and the company is producing shareholder value right now by doing the things that we said that we are going to do and hitting our numbers and you know that’s what we are going to continue to do.
Unidentified Analyst: I think that there is a consistency and this is the second question I have and it’s more along the lines if you comment on this. I think there is a consistency in fixed base conference call that we need to go back to organic growth, this is a large acquisitions now you just said deleverage and give that opportunity to market to see a better performance from the company itself even though I won’t say right off the bat but you have done a phenomenal job with growing in revenues and your AFFO. My question is, are we going to go back to organic growth as the norm for the rest of the year or are we looking to getting bigger than where we are at now because the two would be –with the statement you just made earlier that kind of fee suppose that we are going back to an organic growth model for the company.
David Kay: Yeah I would say that we are not going to grow just for the sake of growth. I mean the cap rates that we have been able to achieve and the deals that we have been able to acquire are transactions that makes sense from an accretion standpoint, they make sense from an integration standpoint and a capability standpoint. We are going to continue to grow at our self-originated deals would be, what we do quarter in and quarter out. Will we look at other opportunities, absolutely we see every deal just about out there on the street that’s a good thing for our shareholders, they should want us to continue to look and see what’s out there but right now we are focused on becoming a pure play net lease company that has a great capital management business in Cole Capital which will provide some growth to us above and beyond the 1.5% plus the CPI escalators that we are going to get in the leases and that should yield a pretty solid return for our shareholders. If you can grow your business up a single digit to low double digit and provide nearly 8% coupon which is where we are trading on a dividend basis, that’s a pretty solid return and for me I’m still scratching my head much like you are as when do we sort of get that respect of the investment community that says, this platform is pretty rock solid, if you look at our free riding perspective and compare us to all the other net lease companies, I would never say discouraging about them but just stack us up, our leverage is higher and we are addressing that, other than that our metrics are every bit as good or better than every other company there and the thing that we can do better than them is our ability to acquire on an individual basis and buy at yield. If you look at where our peers are and I didn’t plan on sort of going into this much detail but if you look at reality income that you just brought up, we just bought their acquisition and big blocky transactions at seven caps. I believe that our portfolio and the acquisitions that we just made at eight caps are far better investments. If you look at [Inaudible] NNN where you focus on either non-investment grade companies that they are buying leases too or you are focused on lower yields or we’re buying at better yields and we are buying better products and we can do that because of the way that we are set up. We have a factory, it’s a machine to acquire assets and we figured out the mouse trap to do that in, we have phenomenal underwriting capabilities and we can close because we have very thing in house. I think the market will ultimately get that and as I continue to tell the story and get out on the road and our team continues to perform that’s hopefully what happens. This isn’t a sales pitch or anything like I have been accused of being very savvy et cetera. We are excited about the business we have a great business. We are able to achieve pretty good spreads, we just got investment grade rating but our cost of debt should continue to come down, unlike most of the other companies in our peer set which are already at their maximum ratings and their spreads are staying about the same. So, I think all those things are positives for our company and hopefully the market will grab hold of that at some point and say these guys really do have a pretty unique business and a unique platform and they are not going to screw it up.
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Lucas a follow up from Capital One. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas – Capital One: Yeah David, just a quick one, can you remind us what the mechanics are of the spend in terms of the SEC interaction and shareholder interaction?

Operator:  Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income Fourth Quarter 2013 Operating Results Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for question (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Terry Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma’am.
Terry Miller: Thank you Danielle and thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income’s fourth quarter and 2013 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be John Case, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Sumit Roy, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. Also joining us on the call is Mike Pfeiffer, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The Company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater details the factors that may cause such differences in the Company’s 2013 Form 10-K. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Case.
John P. Case: Thanks, Terry. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our call. We are certainly pleased with our operating performance for the fourth quarter and our record setting results for the year. I am going to have Paul start and provide an overview of the number. So Paul?
Paul M. Meurer:  Thanks John. As usual I will comment on our financial statements, provide some highlights of the financial results for both the quarter and the year starting with the income statement, total revenue increased over 62% for the quarter and over 61% for the year. This increase obviously reflects our significant growth from new acquisitions over the past year as well as healthy same-store rental growth. Our rental revenue at December 31 on an annualized basis was approximately $819 million. You will note this quarter that we also have added new disclosure regarding tenant reimbursement as an additional revenue line item as well as an identical offsetting amount added to our property expense line. This refers to property expenses that we simply pay first and then get reimbursed by the tenant. There is no financial impact to our earnings they offset each other as revenues and expenses and this is simply new disclosure in our income statements this quarter. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased to over $85 million in the quarter and depreciation expense is obviously increased with our portfolio growth. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $50.6 million. This increase was primarily due to the $750 million issuance of 10 year bonds last July, as well as some credit facility borrowings during the quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remained strong with interest coverage at 3.6 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.0 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the fourth quarter were approximately $16.5 million. They were $56.8 million for the year. Our G&A expense naturally did increased this past year as our acquisition activity increased and we added some new personnel to manage a larger portfolio. Our employee base has grown from 97 employees a year-ago to 115 employees today. Overall our total G&A in 2013 as a percentage of total rental and other revenues was still only 7.5% for the low end of our historic run rate of 7.5% to 8% from revenues. However, our 2013 G&A also had about $8 million of non-recurring unique expenses from accelerated stock vesting of our old 10 year grant back in the third quarter and the acceleration of our former CEO's pay compensation into the 2013 calendar year. To our current projection for G&A for 2014 it’s only about $50 million or approximately 5.5% of revenues. Property expenses are noted as $13 million for the quarter and $39 million for the year. However, as I mentioned these amounts include property expenses reimbursed by tenant. The property expenses that we are responsible for were approximately $3.7 million for the quarter and $13.9 million for the year. And our projection for 2014 for property expenses that we will be responsible if $16.5 million. Income taxes simply consist of income taxes paid to various states by the Company and they were $670,000 for the quarter and $2.7 million for the year. Merger related costs just a reminder this line item refers to the costs associated with the ARCT acquisition earlier in the year and during the quarter, we expensed the remaining $138,000 of such costs. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $15.2 million. This income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We sold 22 properties during the quarter for $28 million with a gain on sales of $14.3 million. And a reminder that we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO. Preferred stock cash dividends totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter and net income available to common stockholders was about $53.9 million for the quarter. Reminder that our normalized FFO simply adds back the ARCT merger related cost to FFO. So our normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.61 for the quarter, an 8.9% increase versus a year ago and $2.41 for the year, a 19.3% increase over 2012. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.52 per share for the quarter, a 12.7% increase versus a year-ago or $2.41 for the year, a 17% increase over 2012. With this growth and earnings we again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. We have increased the dividend 65 consecutive quarters which is over 16 years of consecutive quarterly dividend increases. Dividends paid for common share increased over 21% this year and our monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of $2.186 per share. Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We’ve continued to maintain a conservative and very safe capital structure. As you know in October, we raised $397 million of new capital with a common equity offering. Also on October we expanded our acquisition credit facility to $1.5 billion. As of today we have $583 million of borrowings on that line. We did not assume any in place mortgages during the fourth quarter. We did pay off some of the maturity, so our outstanding net mortgage debt at year-end decreased to approximately $755 million. Our bonds which are all unsecured and fixed rate and continue to be rated Baa1 BBB+ had a weighted average maturity of almost eight years. Our overall debt maturity schedule is also in very good shape, but only $50 million of mortgages coming due in 2014 and $125 million of mortgages coming due in 2015, and our next bond maturity is only a $150 million due in November of 2015. Our overall current debt to total market cap is 33% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 5% of our capital structure. And our debt to EBITDA is only 6.1 times. So in summary revenue growth this quarter was very significant. Our expenses remain moderate, so our earnings growth was very positive. Our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and safe and we continue to enjoy excellent access to the public capital markets to fund our continued growth with well priced long-term capital. Let me turn the call now back over to John who will give you more background on these results.
John P. Case: Thanks Paul. Let me began with this overview of the portfolio which continues to generate consistent cash flow. Our tenants are doing well based on what we're seeing today. As we see, we ended the year with 98.2% occupancy based on the number of properties with just 70 properties available for lease out of our 3,896 properties. This occupancy is from 97.2% one year ago. Our occupancy based on square footage and our economic occupancy are both at 99%. Our property management growth, the largest department in the company has done a great job managing this occupancy and handling our 1,600 lease rollovers since 1990s. We are expecting our occupancy to remain fairly stable for the foreseeable future. Our portfolio remains diversified by tenant, industry, geography and property type. At the end of 2013, our properties were leased to 205 commercial tenants in 47 different industries and located in 49 states plus Puerto Rico. 77% of our rental revenue comes from our traditional retail properties, while 23% comes from non-retail properties with the largest component, the industrial and distribution. We believe this diversification is important and leads to more predictable cash flow streams for our shareholders every time. At the end of the fourth quarter, our 15 largest tenants accounted for 44.6% of rental revenue. That’s down from 47.1% for the same period one year ago. So we continue to make progress on this over time. In 2008, the top 15 accounted for 54.3% of our rental revenues. Within the top 15 there was very little movement from last quarter to this quarter with 15 tenants being represented. No single tenant accounts for more than 5.2% of rental revenue. The diversification by tenant remains quite favorable for us. FedEx continues to be our largest tenant at 5.2% of rental revenue, which is virtually unchanged from last quarter. Walgreens and Family Dollar are again our second and third largest tenants at 5% and 4.8% rental revenue respectively. Walgreens was flat from last quarter, while Family Dollar is down 4.3% and then all other tenants are at or below 3.1% of rental revenues. When you get down to the 15 largest tenants which is Walmart/Sam's Club, it represents only 1.6% of rental revenue and the percentages trail off from there. We’ve added 55 new tenants to the portfolio this year further enhancing our tenant diversification. Convenient stores remain our largest industry but continue to check down as a percentage of rental revenue. Convenient stores now represent 10.6% of rental revenue down from 14.9% a year ago. Drug stores are now at 9.7%, up from 3.3% a year ago. This was the fastest growing industry for us in the last year. It’s well aligned with our strategy of targeting high quality non-discretionary retailers and attractive locations. Restaurants, if you combine both casual dining and quick service segments are now at 9% down from 12.4% a year ago. Dollar stores are now at 7.1%, up from 4.3% a year ago. We continue to provide the deep value proposition this industry offers to our consumers in this economy with consumers under a bit of pressure. Health and fitness is at 6.8%, Theaters are at 5.6% and transportation services are at 5.4% of total revenues. All other industry categories are at or below 4.3% of revenue. So, we continue diversifying our rental revenues by industry. Looking a property type retail always has represents the primary source of our rental revenues at 77% of property revenues with industrial and distribution at 11%, office at 6.5% and the reminder basically evenly divided between manufacturing and agriculture. Of course, we know retail well we continue to focus on retail tenants that meet our investment parameters, more than 90% of our retail portfolios have a service non- discretionary and/or low price point components to investments. We believe these characteristics better position these tenants to successfully operate in all economic environments and make them less vulnerable to Internet competition. Regarding lease length, the average remaining lease terms continues to be just under 11 years. Same-store rents increased 1.8% during the fourth quarter, which we’re pleased with, for the year they increased 1.4%. This level of growth is where we expect it to continue for reminder of the year. Let me take a moment on tenant credit, the credit quality of the portfolio continues to be healthy with 40% of our rental revenue generated from the investment grade tenants. With upon investment grade tenants, those tenants is having an investment grade rating by one or more of the 3 major rating agencies. This revenue percentage is consistent with where it was last quarter, but it’s off from 23.5% at the end of 2012 of the last four years we’ve established a significant foundation of revenues from investment grade tenants, add investment spreads above our historical spreads. Creating a stronger credit profile for our tenant base. We’re also pleased with the rental growth we have been able to generate from these investment grade tenants, 70% of our investment grade leases have renovate increases in them which average 1.5% annual which is consistent with our historical portfolio rental growth rate. Moving on to the property acquisitions, we completed $1.5 billion for the year, at an initial yield of 7.1%. This volume is a record, adding the $3.2 billion acquisition of our ARCT that closed in January of last year. We made a total of $4.7 billion in investments. Regarding cap rates, our policy again is to announce first year cash cap rates for the market and not GAAP cap rates which tend to be notably higher due to the straight lining of rent. We continue to see attractive investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. During the year, our average spreads to our WAC, our weighted average cost of capital was 155 basis points reverting to our long-term average. Now, I’d like to hand it over to Sumit, who will provide some additional color on our acquisitions activity for the quarter and for the year. Sumit?
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John. As John mentioned during the fourth quarter, we made $145.3 million in property level investments in 66 properties at an average initial cash yield of 7.3% with a weighted average lease term of 12.5 years. 62% of the revenues generated by these acquisitions is from investment grade tenants. These assets are leased to 21 different tenants in 16 different industries. Most significant industry is represented with discount stores, drug stores, diversified industrial and health and fitness. The properties are located in 28 states, and 80% of the investments are comprised of our traditional retail properties. In 2013, we invested $1.514 billion in 459 properties, at an average initial cash cap rate of 7.1% and lease term of 14 years. 65% of total rents are generated by investment grade tenants. The assets are leased to 32 different tenants in 23 different industries. Most significant industry is represented with drugstores, discount stores, health and fitness and wholesale clubs. The properties are located in 40 states. 84% of the investments are comprised of our traditional retail properties, 10% industrial and 9% in office. Including ARCT, we have invested $4.7 billion in 974 properties in 2013. Regarding transaction flow, we continue to see mostly a record volume of transaction this year. We sourced $39.4 billion in acquisition opportunities in 2013 of which $2.6 billion was sourced in the fourth quarter. To put it in perspective the $39.4 billion sourced in 2013 was more than double the volume sourced in all of 2012, which was a record year of sourcing for us. The volume of opportunities were primarily driven by large portfolios and entity level transactions as compared to one of transactions. However, of the 1.5 billion in property level transactions closed in 2013 over 30% or approximately $461 million where one-off transactions. Our relationships continue to be a paramount importance to us. Approximately 66% of the 1.5 billion in transactions closed in 2013 were relationship driven. As you can see we have continued to leverage our relationships and have remained very selective in our investment and our pursuing only those transactions that offer superior risk adjusted returns and fit our strategic portfolio objectives. Overall, we have been pleased with the investment results achieved in 2013. After pricing, cap rates have remained stable in the fourth quarter. The stickiness of the cap rates are testament to the amount of capital continuing to pursue transactions. Investment grade property cap rates range from 6.25 to 7.15. Non-investment grade properties are trading from7.25 to 8.25 cap rate. From 2010 to 2013, we have consummated over $4.4 billion in organic acquisitions, that’s excluding ARCT, of which 55% has been investment grade credit and approximately 45% non-investment grade or non-rated credit. We invested over $1.8 billion during this period in our traditional non-investment grade retail of which approximately $418 million was in 2013. To put this in context, this was a more active 4 year period for investments in non-rated, non-investment grade retail than any other 4 year period in our company’s history. Our investment philosophy of pursuing opportunities that provide the best risk adjusted returns across the credit spectrum remains consistent with our stated strategy. For 2013, our investment spread remains healthy. Spreads relative to a nominal cost of equity averaged 112 bps for the year, as compared to our historic average of approximately 110 bps. For the quarter they were closer to 135 bps. As John mentioned, looking at our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital, we averaged 155 bps which is comparable to our historical average. We have continued to make investment at historic spreads while improving the credit its tenants and cash flows associated with those investments. So in conclusion we saw an exceptional level of volume in the sector and have been pleased with our $1.51 billion investment in 2013. Including ARCT we invested $4.7 billion in 2013, by par a record investment year for us. John?
John P. Case: Thanks Sumit. We recently disclosed as we know a $503 million acquisition of 84 single tenant net lease properties from d diversified. We believe this acquisition should close in three trenches during the first quarter or first four months of the year. The first tranche of 46% properties closed at the end of January for $202 million. It’s our policy not to announce acquisitions since or after they close, however in this case the seller was required to disclose the contract so we also disclosed a potential sale. We are subject to a confidentially agreement within one that prevents us from commenting on the transaction, beyond what is already been publically disclosed in the file they case. As this is our custom we will address all quarterly acquisition activity collectively on the earnings call following the quarter and which is close. Going to property dispositions we continue selling select properties and redeploying the capital into investment that are better that our investment strategy. During the year, we sold 75 properties for $134.2 million at a cap rate of approximately 7% on the sale of leased assets. We currently believe our dispositions for 2014 will be in the neighborhood of $50 million possibly reaching $75 million. Moving on to the balance sheet as Paul mentioned we remain conservatively capital loss with excellent access to all forms of capital. Currently we have more than $900 million available on our line to fund acquisition. We will continue to match fund our acquisitions with permanent and long-term capital, the majority being equity. All our bond issuance in our company’s history that’s 14 of them at a term of 10 years or longer with the exception of one, a five-year notes insurance. We did smooth out our maturity schedule. And outside temporary borrowings on the credit facility 100% of our outstanding debt is fixed rate. On to our earnings for 2013, normalized FFO and AFFO were both $2.41 per share for the year. Our growth in normalized FFO per share was 19.3%, more than double our previous historical volume. And growth in AFFO per share was 17% versus 2012, also a record. As we look forward, coming off such a good year from an operational perspective, we remain quite optimistic as we continue to see a robust market for acquisitions with excellent investment opportunities in both non-investment grade retail assets as well as investment grade properties. Over our 45-year history, we’ve developed many relationships through which we are continuing to generate acquisition opportunities. We are raising our acquisitions guidance for 2014 from $1 billion to $1.2 billion. Our earnings guidance for 2014 remains at $2.53 to $2.58 per share for both normalized FFO and AFFO. We are maintaining our earnings guidance despite the increased guidance through acquisitions due to the anticipated timing for these acquisitions. Our dividends pay during the year increased by just over 21% compared to 2012, the largest increase in our company’s history. In December, we declared our 74th dividend increase since the company went public in 1994. We remain optimistic that our activities will continue to support our ability to increase the dividend. Our payout ratio during 2013 was approximately 88% of our AFFO, which is at a level we are comfortable with. So with that, I’d now like to open it up for questions. Danielle?
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good afternoon, guys. I was just hoping you could speak a little bit more about the trend you’re seeing, cap rates, you said they were fairly sticky in the fourth quarter partially due to the sort of rate of money I guess. Do you anticipate that the stay that the case kind of for the foreseeable future in 2014 based on what you’re seeing? And, you talked a little bit about historic spreads and the spreads you got in the fourth quarter. But could you give us a sense where spot spread is relative to your cost of capital and how you’re thinking about that?
John P. Case: Sure, Juan. First of all, with regard to cap rates, we expect them to stay pretty steady. There is a lot of capital out there pursuing these types of assets. So we don’t anticipate them climbing from here. With regard to spreads, our spot spread, if you will, is roughly equivalent to where we were for 2013. So at this point it looks like we’re holding our spreads. Spreads are down from their peak year of 2012. Its capital has been reprised and there we just see sudden movement last year in cap rates and then they stabilized.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. I kind of mixed this rather quickly. The reason the guidance here are the same, yet the acquisitions was prompt for the 2014 guidance, you said it was if I understand correctly because of the timing, would it seems like you’ve drawn on your revolver implying you’ve done a fair chunk of the 1.2% sort of year-to-date, I was just curious if you give little bit more color as I may have missed the details.
John P. Case: Yes, it’s based on timing and as you know from the time we solicit a transaction to the time it actually close, this can take up to six months. So from a timing perspective we would anticipate the additional acquisitions occurring later in the year and having more of an impact on 2015 and 2014. And as you know the quarter is a pretty lumpy for acquisitions for instance last quarter we did a $145 million in the year end which we did $1.5 billion of total acquisition, so you can never really extrapolate from one quarter to an entire year, so we are comfortable with the guidance where it is.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Okay and the drawdown of the revolver since the end of the year that should we assume that is related to acquisitions?
John P. Case: Yes.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Okay great thank you guys.
Paul M. Meurer: Thank you, Juan.
Operator:  And our next question is from Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Please go ahead.
Ross T. Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC:  Hi guys good afternoon.
John P. Case: Hi Ross.
Ross T. Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: My question to you would this, if you are forecasting now $1.2 billion of acquisitions, what probability would you put on doing say twice that versus you are not going to do not, I’m just wondering given the robust pipeline that’s out there and what you’ve got all ready sort of locked up. Do you still think that $1.2 billion, you guys have always been conservative in your guidance and I’m just sitting here wondering are we still in an arena where you could just blow that away?
Paul M. Meurer: Well, we are quite selective Ross, as you kind of let me – over the last few years we’ve been buying 6% to 12% of our source transactions, so it’s always driven by what the opportunities are? Do those opportunities need our investment parameters and are they priced appropriately and so there are always difficult to forecast. Right now investor expectation is approximately $1.2 billion, for organic property level acquisitions.
Ross T. Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC: And based on what you are seeing, how much of that do you think it’s going to be in portfolios versus more smaller one-offs?
John P. Case: I would say, if you would normalize it for the end of the year, I’d say about 65% to 70% would be portfolio deals.
Ross T. Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC:  And from a property type perspective what are you thinking in terms of how much of that’s going to be retail versus other?
John P. Case: The vast majority would be retail.
Ross T. Nussbaum – UBS Securities LLC:  Okay, thank you.
John P. Case: Thank you, Ross.
Operator:

Todd J. Stender – Wells Fargo Securities LLC:  I guess I’ll start with you Paul, just on the sourcing capital front, can you just comment on the preferred market, kind of how it influences your capital sourcing activity and out for sometime that preferred market has been essentially closed and I know you guys have room in your capital stack for, but I want to as you look out over the next couple of quarters how you’re budgeting your capital.
Paul M. Meurer: I think my comments can be fairly short talking about the preferred markets. It is pretty opportunistic as you know. It’s going to ebb and flow kind of be more available at different times, and I have to say as a general remark, it’s not the most available market at the moment. I only say that you could actually do it, but related to where you could issue and therefore have a reasonable spread really doesn’t make sense. I think that case there maybe high fixes on a coupon and so that's not something we're really staring out at the moment. Over time we love preferred, no maturity obviously, and great way to match fund, long-term assets like we like to probably do the longer debt, but at the moment preferred is probably not in the cards for the foreseeable future.
Todd J. Stender – Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then on the same store growth, it seemed pretty high, was 1.8%. I think, John, you mentioned little closer 1.5%. How did you get that high’s? Usually I guess where you stood may be closer to 1%, but it’s made a pretty good move, I guess what’s contributing to this?
John P. Case:  Well, in 2012, we were impacted by a couple of bankruptcies, Buffets and Friendly. So that put a bit of a lid on it and it’s picked back up as we’ve pushed through that into 2013. The growth is coming from a number of industries, in convenient stores, quick service restaurants, beverages, they're all doing quite well for us and we think it should be around 1.5% for the year and that’s sort of a run rate right now we're pretty comfortable with.
Todd J. Stender – Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Just sticking with you, John, I think you mentioned this. Can you just repeat the percentage of investment grade tenant leases that contain annual rate escalators did you say 7% to 8%?
John P. Case: Yes, 70% of our investment grade leases have rent growth which average 1.5% a year.
Todd J. Stender – Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you. Just switching gears, I think you alluded to this, but if not can you just talk about some of the qualitative benefits that you’ve realized, I guess going back from your ECM portfolio acquisition, which got you into the industrial segment? And then you’ve got ARCT, which moved the needle for you guys into the investment grade segment. Items like relationships you develop with new tenants or maybe your first look at a sale lease back, anything you can share with us that you benefited from these large portfolio transactions?
John P. Case: Yes, I think you’ve hit on it. We have really been able to multiply exponentially the number of tenant relationships we have and the opportunities for investment in terms of properties. So one reason for the increase and the source volume activity has been your net lease has been mainstream. So I think everybody is seeing more of it. So we’re seeing more of it in the retail alone, but we’re also seeing more of it as the property types in which we can invest or expand it. So we’ve seen more activity as a result of the acquisitions we’ve done and had really many more relationships through which to generate acquisition opportunities. So, I mean, we had to size today, where we feel like we see everything in the marketplace and I don't think that was the case for apps four, five years ago.
Todd J. Stender – Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thanks. And finally, just on the disposition front. How are you kind of thinking about that as you look out to 2014? Are we going to see more of the mix on vacancies, the short-term leases, any property types, any color you can provide on dispositions?
John P. Case: Yes, when you look at the dispositions, we're thinking maybe 50 million to 75 million for this year. When you look at the activity there, it's a combination of assets, where we’ve seen perhaps the operating performance decline, any areas where we would like to decrease our industry exposure, or where we have the few credit concerns. And in a few cases, there is some assets that are performing all right, but just don’t meet our investment strategy, in other words, it could be a multitenant asset that we are selling.
Todd J. Stender – Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
John P. Case: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Lucas with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.
Christopher A. Lucas – Green Street Advisors, Inc: Thanks and good afternoon guys. The other quick question on depositions in the convenience stores, can you kind of – looking at your portfolio today you mentioned convenience store concentration is down slightly versus Q3. What’s the right level of convenience stores and casual dining restaurants in your portfolio and how long do you think it will stay together?
John P. Case: Yes. We were comfortable with where they are today. We brought and sold significantly down sea stores and restaurants and 10% were comfortable. We had selectively sold some properties in both of those sectors, but really our concentration levels were brought down through our growth and diversified asset pools like the ones that we’ve been watching and a bit concerned with. We continue to look at in particular a couple of casual dining situations and then a couple of the smaller sea stores that don’t produce the same sort of store sales figures that we like to see in our investments there.
Christopher A. Lucas – Green Street Advisors, Inc: Got it. Thanks and just one more question. Just going back to the 70% of investment grade leases that have red bumps, could you give a break down of that by property type?
John P. Case: Yes. The industrial distribution and office are both around 2% and the retail is at 1.25%.
Christopher A. Lucas – Green Street Advisors, Inc: Okay, got it. And then in that 70% how much of that is say, I don’t know 50% retail, maybe 30% industrial in terms of the composition of actual 70%?
John P. Case: Yes, I think retail is probably about half of it. And then the other categories constitute the remaining half.
Christopher A. Lucas – Green Street Advisors, Inc:  Got it. Thanks guys.
John P. Case: Yes, thanks.
Operator:  Our next question is from Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Rich C. Moore – RBC Capital Markets:  Hi, good afternoon guys. I am curious, the boundary line in credit John, I mean you have $600 million underlying credit at the moment and I assume we will be taking that out with permanent capital fairly quickly. And then I am wondering why the 1.5 billion, are you anticipating that you will need the 1.5 billion capacity, I guess?
John P. Case: Let me start with the first part of your question. We have plenty of flexibility right now on the revolvers that we have no immediate concrete permanent capital or long-term capital plans. So that’s the first answer to your first question. Why the size? We like the additional liquidity and security and safety that provides the company and it also allows us to pursue larger transactions on a non-financing contingent basis, which really is a competitive advantage that only a few players in the market have.
Rich C. Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Yes, the other is…
John P. Case: The other piece of flexibility Rich is timing of the capital rates. So kind of looking now, which again John said, is not eminent in terms of definitive plans we have at the moment, but then able to time the market appropriately having the balance they are likely to do that.
Rich C. Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. So, have you guys seen something of the size that you would need a credit line that big to take down?
John P. Case: Well, I mean we’ve seen opportunities with all different forms and shapes and sizes. So we’ve seen over the last several years a few opportunities that would have required the vast majority of that revolver.
Rich C. Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, good. Got it. Thanks. And then, I’m curious on the operating expense. I’m not sure why you made that change and it’s interesting that you did, but it’s probably just more detail, but so I guess that’s each question…
John P. Case: Question about the tenant reimbursement stuff?
Rich C. Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Yes, including the tenant imbursements and breaking it out.
John P. Case: You know what, Rich, I don’t like it. I mean, it’s one of those things at the disclosure standpoint. It’s an appropriate accounting approach and it doesn’t add anything for you guys, because these are basically expenses that we do get reimbursed for. We don’t have major outstanding receivables related to them anything like that, but disclose rate through. The issue was they’ve just gotten to be a little bit more in size. So once they reach little bit more of a material amount, which is now about $25 million annually it was prudent to break it out at some additional disclosure. But I wanted to make sure I was highlighting to you don’t count that in the revenue line and forget about the fact that it offset immediately down the expense line.
Rich C. Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Right. Okay. I got your point. So, when you’re looking at the small operating expenses with the operating expenses that are reimbursed, it went down a little bit this quarter, I mean, it’s not a huge number to begin with, but only down. And remind me, is that just a vacant asset or do guys have some of the multi-tenant or double net type leases or something like that that is also part of that?
John P. Case: No, it’s both. I mean, historically it was primarily carry cost on the vacant properties, tax of insurance, utilities. But over the last 18 to 24 months we have purchased properties with double net structure where we have some responsibilities for roof and structure and as such that budget is in there as some additional property expenses, still only $16.5 million budgeted for next year on what the current run rate of $890 million of annualized revenue. So, still not a huge number, but it has gone up a bit past few years.
Rich C. Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, good. Thanks. And then, the last thing. The other revenue line item, which you know has a couple of crazy things in it. Do you guys have an estimate for what that might be or is there just no way to do that?
John P. Case: Yes, the way I will answer that is don’t put zero in because something always tends up there. Business property taking, which could be an eminent domain grab of some property line if they widened the highway, it’s kind of pretty money if you will. In many cases not impinging on your parking or things of that nature. And then, interest income. If you have cash that’s received early that you’re putting away in a bank briefly for some income or you’ve raised something on offering that you haven’t used for a day or two. So it just ends up being something. So my only advice it’s to not put zero in, but I hate to give a number, but there is always going to be something there.
Rich C. Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, good. Great. Thank you, guys.
John P. Case: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: The next question is from Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Please go ahead.
Emmanuel Korchman – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Hey, guys.
John P. Case: Hi, Emmanuel.
Emmanuel Korchman – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: When you guys think about the investment spreads you’ve been quoting in the spreads, your weighted average cost of capital. Do you think that was permanent financing or using a line especially in sort of spot investments?
John P. Case: No, we’re looking at it based on permanent financing using roughly two-thirds equity, one-third 10-year fixed rate notes.
Emmanuel Korchman – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Got it. And then, if we think about the pipelines that we look at and maybe passed on, I think you’ve quote numbers around $60 billion over the last couple of years. How much of that is ended up in sort of either public or other known hands and how much of it has been bought from the market?
John P. Case: I’d say a significant portion has ended up in the hands of public or private. So we see a lot of it in terms of the exact breakdown.
Paul M. Meurer: You’re right. Yes, you’re right, John, I’d say a majority of them have ended up in either public or private hands, but there have been occasions on large, very large transactions that we aware of where those transactions will float.
John P. Case: Yes.
Emmanuel Korchman – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  And was it mostly a pricing thing that it ended up, that you guys passed on it or where there other considerations?
John P. Case: The situations that I’m alluding to you were all driven by pricing considerations.
Emmanuel Korchman – Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Great. That’s all from me. Thank you.
John P. Case:  Thanks, Emmanuel.
Paul M. Meurer: Thanks.
Operator:  Our next question is from Todd Lukasik with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar Research:  Hi, guys. This is Todd Lukasik. Thanks for taking my questions today.
John, P. Case:
 :
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar Research: Hey. It’s just a question on office. 6.6% of revenue, it looks like and there is a [indiscernible] submitted into the portfolio again this past quarter. I think in the past you guys have talk about that not being one of your favorite property types. I’m wondering if there is anything in particular about the assets that you’re buying there that are especially attractive or sellers are requiring that those be concluded in deals or that may change in thinking around those office properties?
John, P. Case: Well, the office asset, we were typically acquiring office properties that are part of larger portfolios of retail and industrial and distribution properties. That is not always the case. Times will extend our relationship, for instance, with some of our retail tenants by purchasing their office or industrial property as well. So we’ll see some activity from those areas, but our objective is keep office fairly low as a percentage of our overall property rental revenue.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar Research: I know some of those are coming on the balance sheet because the seller is requiring that be part of the deal?
Paul M. Meurer: No fairly. I mean, like John said sometimes they’re any larger portfolio meaning a service pack transaction that was already affected by another service pack provider in this part of a portfolio or it’s the direct conversation with a strong long-term retailer relationship where the assets take a look at, say, their headquarters’ location as an asset we consider doing something with. But not fortunate as that’s part of a larger deal in dialog.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar Research:  Got you. Okay, that’s helpful. And then, just with regards to AFFO coverage on the dividend, with more industrial and distribution facilities office assets on the balance sheet, those things expire if the tenants doesn’t renew there may be more leasing cost or CapEx that needs to be put into some of those properties to define a new tenant. Is that the kind of thing that might cause you to think to lower the AFFO payout ratio overtime as those we can start to roll or is that you’re comfortable with sort of 88% level in light of those possible incremental cost on the road?
Paul M. Meurer: Don I think over time we would like to see at the just bit lower somewhere in the mid 80s is the level we think we will be comfortable with.
John P. Case: Having said that we’ll continue to grow the dividend, as it relates…
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar Research: Sure
John P. Case: Our overall earnings growth so, if you are talking about x percent of growth, then we are going to be try and grow the dividend 0.8x or whatever might be, to try to move that payout ratio down a little bit over time but it will certainly result in what we think will be dividend growth that will be amenable to and helpful to the investor from a return perspective over time.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar Research: Yes, okay, got you. That’s helpful. Thanks a lot guys.
John P. Case: Thanks Todd.
Operator: And our next question is from Jonathan Pong with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Hey good afternoon guys.
John P. Case: Hey Jonathan.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird: Sumit I think you mentioned earlier there is a 65-35 split between portfolio and single tenant deals for 2014, is that 65 include the MN deal or I just think going forward deal yet to announced is going to be 55% portfolio?
Sumit Roy: Yes, Jonathan that was a back foot looking that is for 2010 to 2013 so it been obviously included inline transaction which has been closed which includes till 2014.\
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird: Got it, so 2014 what do you think that split ends up?
Sumit Roy: No, it’s going to be similar, I think there was a question asked around where do we see a lot of our volume composition, how do we see our volume competition on the opposition side and I still believe that it’s a big chunkier transaction drive volume and that will represent 65 to 70% of it. And in terms of investment grade versus non-investment grade, it;s going to function of our cost of capital and what we see in the market. There was a repricing of our cost of capital which allowed us to look at areas that we have traditionally being perusing to get the kind of spread we been able to track and so I could see it being right around that 50% to 60% investment grade for 2014 as well but it could be different.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird: All right, Then Paul may be a balance sheet question, on the inland purchase there another some debt that you are assuming there of the trenches that are yet to close how much more the revolver is inland going to take on?
Paul M. Meurer: Well, as you know with $202 million at the end of January close and some of that involved assuming mortgages about $50 million or so and though you cannot do the math from there because $500 million transaction the montage amount on it, is that 150 so a 100 is assumed out of the $300 million left to close so say $200 million is need on the facility to ultimately close the balance of the inline transaction.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird: Great that’s helpful. Thanks a lot.
Sumit Roy: Thanks Joe.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris R. Lucas – Capital One Securities, Inc.: Good afternoon guys. As John I just want to see if you can give some more color on the acquisition environment and particular I guess what I am trying to under is where the most competitive size of deal, is it the one-off, is it the small portfolio, where is the market most competitive right now?
John P. Case:  It’s most competitive on larger portfolios where there – you’re definitely seeing spell in this market, premium cap rates, foreign cap rates for the same asset and a $300 million portfolio transaction then you would see any one-off asset transaction. And again, I attribute that to the fact that there is a fair amount of capital in our industry and business and to deploy it efficiently and quickly once they premium paid for the asset at the. So we do see that spread all things being equal, and asset acquired on a one-off basis. That’s going to have a higher cap rate than one acquired on a larger portfolio. However, that is not universally the case, but that’s certainly the trend perhaps.
Chris R. Lucas – Capital One Securities, Inc.:  And then just a question on that. If the 10/31 market is recovering at all, is there much activity coming from sort of that one-off buyer, the small individual tax incentive buyer?
John P. Case:  There is more activity. We saw more activity in 2013 than we did in the previous few years combined property. So it's come back. It's still not back to where it once was, pre-Great Recession, but we’re seeing more activity there.
Chris R. Lucas – Capital One Securities, Inc.: So what do you think changes that momentum? Is this financing availability or – well, turned up investments. What you think of kind of gain.
John P. Case: Yes this is a bit more of an impressive investment environment that you had. Again, people are getting their feet under that and feeling a bit more confident even though the economic signals appear to be mixed. They're just seeing more people go into transaction in that marketplace.
Chris R. Lucas – Capital One Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it.
John P. Case: Thanks Chris.
Paul M. Meurer: Thanks.

Operator: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) And as a remainder this call is being recorded October 31, 2013. I’d now like to turn the call over to Terry Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations for Realty Income. Please go ahead.
Terry Miller: Thank you, Craig and thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income’s third quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our third quarter results will be John Case, Chief Executive Officer; Paul Meurer, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; Sumit Roy, Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. Also joining us on the call are Gary Malino, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Pfeiffer, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel. During this conference call, we’ll make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The Company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We’ll disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company’s Form 10-Q. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Case.
John P. Case: Thanks, Terry. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our call. We are pleased with Company’s operating performance for the third quarter with solid results coming from our areas of the business. Paul is going to start and review the financial numbers, so I’m going to hand it over to Paul. Paul?
Paul M. Meurer: Thanks, John. So as usual, I’m going to comment on our financial statements and provide a few highlights of our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 70% for the quarter. Our current revenue on an annualized basis is approximately $805 million. This increase reflects positive same-store rents of 1.3%, but more significantly it obviously reflects our growth in new acquisitions over the past year. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased significantly to almost $81 million in the quarter as depreciation expense has obviously increased with our portfolio growth. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $49.7 million. This increase was primarily due to the $800 million of bonds that were issued last October and the $750 million bond issuance in July, as well as some credit facility borrowings during the quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong with interest coverage at 3.5 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.9 times. General and administrative expenses or G&A in the third quarter was approximately $16.6 million. Our G&A expense has naturally increased this past year as our acquisition activity has increased and we did add some new personnel to manage a larger portfolio. Our employee base has grown from 92 employees a year-ago to 114 employees at quarter end. The other unique factor though in our third quarter G&A was a $3.7 million non-cash expense related to the acceleration in July of our older 10 year stock brands to five year vesting. Overall, our total G&A year-to-date as a percentage of total revenues was still only 7.3% compared to historically our G&A at a run rate of about 7.5% to 8% of revenues. Our current projection for G&A for 2014 is about $50 million or less than 6% of revenues. Property expenses were approximately $5.9 million for the quarter. Our property expense estimate for all of 2013 is about $18 million. And our projection for 2014 is $20 million. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the Company and they were $671,000 for the quarter. Merger-related costs, obviously this line item refers to the costs associated with the ARCT acquisition earlier in the year. During the quarter, we expensed $240,000 of such remaining costs. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $6.6 million. This income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We sold 19 properties during the quarter for $22.4 million with a gain on sales of $6.2 million. And a reminder that we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO. Preferred stock cash dividends totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter and net income available to common stockholders was about $41 million for the quarter. Turning to FFO and AFFO, reminder that our normalized FFO simply add back the ARCT merger-related costs to FFO. Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.59 for the quarter, a 13.5% increase versus a year-ago. It would have been $0.61, but it was reduced $0.02 by the non-cash expense for the accelerated stock vesting I already mentioned. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash that we have available for distribution as dividend was $0.60 for the quarter, a 15.4% increase versus a year-ago. We again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. We have increased the dividend 64 consecutive quarters and 73 times overall since we went public over 19 years ago. Dividends paid per common share increased 23% this quarter versus the same quarterly period a year-ago. And our current monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of just over $2.18 per share. Our AFFO dividend payout ratio is currently about 89%. Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We’ve continued to maintain a conservative and very safe capital structure. As you know in July we raised $750 million of new capital with a 10-year bond offering. Earlier this month we did a $397 million common equity offering. And just this week we closed on the accordion expansion of our acquisition credit facility for a new capacity of $1.5 billion. We currently have about $100 million of borrowings on that line. We do want to take a moment to say thank you to the investment banks and commercial lending partners who helped us access this capital over the past several months and we’re grateful to the bond and equity investors to continue to support us with their capital as we continue to grow as a Company. We do not assume any in-place mortgages during the quarter, so our outstanding mortgage debt has decreased to approximately $780 million. As for debt maturities, we have a $11 million of mortgages coming due in Q4 this year, $64 million of mortgages due in 2014 and $125 million of mortgages in 2015 and our next bond maturity is only a $150 million due in November of 2015. Our overall current total debt to total market cap is 30% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 4.5% of our capital structure. And our debt to EBITDA today is currently only 5.8 times. So in summary, revenue growth this quarter was significant and our expenses remain moderate to our earnings grow was very positive and our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and safe and we do continue to enjoy excellent access to the public capital markets to fund our continued growth. Now let me turn the call back over to John who will give you more background on these results.
John P. Case: Thanks, Paul. I'll begin with an overview of the portfolio which continues to generate consistent cash flow. Our tenants are doing well and based on what we're seeing now, we do not anticipate any issues in the foreseeable future. We ended the third quarter with 98.1% occupancy based on the number of properties with 73 properties available for lease out of 3,866 properties. Our occupancy is up from 97% one year ago. Occupancy based on square footage is 98.9% and the economic occupancy is 99%. Our occupancy remains stable and strong and we expect our occupancy at the end of the year to be in these areas, so we're comfortable with where they are. Same-store rents increased 1.3% during the quarter and year-to-date versus the same period last year. We're pleased with this level of growth and think it will continue over the next few quarters and perhaps be even a touch higher. At the end of the third quarter, our 15 largest tenants accounted for 44.4% of our revenue. That's down 2.4% from the same period one year ago. However, it's up about 1% from last quarter. And as you know, this number will ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter but generally speaking our acquisitions efforts will continue to diversify our rental revenues. We've continued to make progress on this over time. If you look back to 2008 in the top 15 accounted for 54.3% of revenue and again today it's 44.4%. We continued to diversify our overall portfolio, again with 3,866 properties lead to 200 commercial enterprises and 47 different industries across 49 states plus Puerto Rico. We remain well diversified by industry, no industry accounts were more than 11.2% of our revenue. Convenient stores are our largest industry at 11.2% and that's down 5.1% from a year ago. Drug stores are now at 9.3%, up 5.8% from a year ago. Restaurants, if you combine both the casual dining segment and the quick service segment, are now at 9.2% of our revenues, down 4% from a year ago. As you may recall, in early 2008, restaurants were approximately 24% of our revenues. Dollar stores are now at 6.3%, up 3.3% from a year ago. Health and fitness is at 6.1% of revenues virtually unchanged from a year ago. Theaters are at 5.9%, down 3.6% from a year ago. And finally transportation services are 5.3% up 2.8% from a year ago. All other industry categories are below 4.5% of revenue. So we're in good shape keeping our revenues diversified by industry. Looking at individual tenants, our largest tenant remains FedEx at 5.1% of revenues; Walgreen and Family Dollar are second and third largest tenants at 5% and 4.9% of revenue respectively. Walgreen is up by about 1% from last year and Family Dollar is up by about 1.5% from last quarter. L.A. Fitness is now at 4.2% which is down 30 basis points from last quarter. All other tenants are at or below 3.1% of overall revenues. When you go down to our 15th largest tenant which is Walmart and Sam's Club, it represents only 1.6% of revenue. If you move another five spots and go to our 20th largest tenant, it represents just 1.3% of revenue. So we're still very well diversified by tenant. The credit quality of the portfolio continues to improve with about 40% of our revenue generated from investment grade tenants. This is up about 1.5% from the last quarter and 19% from quarter end 2012. In terms of our top 15 tenants, about 26% of that is generated from eight investment grade tenants. As recently as 2010, there was only one investment grade tenant in our top 15 and that tenant generated just over 5% of revenue. So we remain comfortable having a significant portion of our rental revenues coming from high credit tenants. In terms of lease length, the average remaining lease term is just under 11 years at 10.9 years. Relative to property dispositions we continue selling select properties to further strength the portfolio. During the quarter, we sold 19 properties for $22.4 million which brings us to 53 properties sold for the year for $106.1 million. The sales this quarter were primarily in the restaurant, child daycare and convenient store and the streets. For the year we're looking at approximately 125 million in properties dispositions. Moving on to property acquisitions. During our third quarter we completed approximately 503 million in property level investments at a yield of 7.1%. This gets us to 1.37 billion for the first nine months of the year, excluding the $3.2 billion acquisition of ARCT that closed in January of this year. So we are raising our acquisitions guidance for 2013 to approximately 1.5 billion from the previously leased 1.25 billion. We're quite pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing on the acquisitions front and now I'd like to hand it over to Sumit Roy, our recently appointed Chief Investment Officer who's headed acquisitions for about a year now to discuss acquisitions. Sumit?
Sumit Roy: Thank you, John. We remained active on the acquisition front. During the third quarter, we made 502.7 million in property level investments in 219 properties at an average initial cash yield of 7.1% with a weighted average lease term of 14.7 years. 72% of the revenue generated by these acquisitions is from investment grade tenants. These assets are leased to 20 different tenants in 15 different industries. Four other tenants are new to our portfolio and most significant industries represented with discount store, drug stores and health and fitness. The properties are located in 33 states. 81% of the investments are comprised of our traditional retail properties. We were successful in accelerating the closing on a number of transactions in the third quarter and were pleased with the activity this quarter. Through third quarter 2013, as John mentioned, we've invested 1.37 billion in 407 properties at an average initial cap rate of 7% and lease term of 14.1 years. 65% of total rent was generated by investment grade tenants. These assets are leased to 35 different tenants in 21 different industries. The properties are located in 40 states. 84% of the investments are comprised of our traditional retail properties. Including ARCT, year-to-date we have invested approximately $4.5 billion in total investments. Regarding our outlook. Given our current pipeline for the remaining quarter and as John has mentioned, we now think 2013 acquisitions will pencil in at approximately 1.5 billion for the year versus our last guidance of at least 1.25 billion. The 1.5 billion in forecasted acquisitions is an addition to the 3.2 billion in acquisitions of ARCT during the first quarter. On transaction flow, we continue the theme of seeing a record amount of transaction flow this year. We sourced 37 billion in acquisition opportunities through the third quarter, 17 billion of which was sourced in the third quarter alone. To put it in perspective, the 17 billion sourced in the third quarter is equal to the volume sourced in all of 2012 which was a record year of sourcing for us. The volume of opportunities were primarily driven by large portfolios and entity level transactions as compared to one-off transactions. We have remained very selective in our acquisitions and are pursuing only those that match what we are trying to do strategically with the portfolio. We continue to analyze a number of these sourced opportunities but have ceased to pursue a majority of these transactions that came in third quarter. In a large portfolio, unless the vast majority of the properties fit our investment strategy, we will elect to pass. Overall we are pleased with the acquisitions volume and a lot of it has been smaller, organic, relationship driven property transactions that offer superior risk adjusted returns and fit where we’re trying to go with the portfolio. As to pricing, cap rates has stabilized at the levels where they were at the end of the second quarter. Still a lot of capital perusing transactions. Investment grade property cap rates range from 6.25% to 7.25%. Non-investment grade properties are trading from 7.25% to 8.25% cap rates. Looking at spreads, third quarter investment spreads remained healthy. We invested $502.7 million at a 7.1% cap rate. As we have frequently discussed we look at our investment spreads relative to a nominal cost of equity and that has averaged 111 bps over the last 20 years with most of that leased to non-investment grade tenants. With over 72% of acquisitions investment grade, our cap rate of 7.1% represents a spread of approximately 110 bps to our current nominal cost of equity. We like the ability to continue to upgrade the tenant credit quality and yet remain close to our historical average spread. So in conclusion, we continue to see an exceptional level of volume in the sector and have been pleased with our $1.37 billion in acquisitions to date including ARCT we’ve closed $4.5 billion in acquisitions. John?
John P. Case: Thanks, Sumit. Obviously we’re pleased with the acquisitions we closed this quarter and our level of activity, and we expect acquisitions to remain active for us for this foreseeable future. Yeah, acquisitions also continues to be the primary driver of our revenue, earnings and dividend growth. We are pleased with our earnings in the third quarter our growth in normalized FFO per share is 13.5% versus the third quarter of 2012 and our growth in AFFO per share is 15.4% versus the third quarter of 2012. As Paul mentioned our balance sheet and access to capital remain strong so we have plenty of flexibility to pursue acquisitions. Just last week we completed our second largest equity offering in the history of the company by raising $378 million in net proceeds. We used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our credit facility to permanently and accretively finance third quarter acquisitions activity. Additionally you may have seen two days ago we announced the expansion of our credit facility from $1 billion to $1.5 billion by exercising the in-place $500 million accordion feature that Paul spoke to a few minutes ago. Given the level of acquisitions activity we had been experiencing, we like the additional flexibility to $1.5 billion capacity gives us. We currently have $1.4 billion in available credit capacity on our facility. Relative to the earnings guidance for this year, we’ve tightened our range for FFO and raised and tightened our range for AFFO. We now expect normalized FFO per share to be $2.38 to $2.42 for the year, which represents 18% to 20% FFO per share growth. We also adjusted our AFFO per share to $2.38 to $2.42, which represents 16% to 17% AFFO per share growth. AFFO continues to be a primary focus of ours as it does represent the recurring cash flow from which we pay dividends. We’ve also established earnings guidance for 2014 with normalized FFO estimated to be $2.53 to $2.58 per share which represents 5% to 8% FFO per share growth over the 2013 estimated range. AFFO is estimated to be $2.53 to $2.58 per share as well which represents again 5% to 8% AFFO per share growth. Regarding dividends, we remain optimistic that our activities will continue to support our ability to increase the dividend. Last month we announced the 73rd dividend increase since the company went public in 1994. This brings the annualized dividend amount to just over $2.18 per share. Our dividends paid year-to-date have increased just under 22% over the same period last year. Our payout ratio is currently at about 89% of our AFFO which is a level we are comfortable with. And finally, I’d be remiss if I did not note that this is our Company’s first earnings call since our former CEO, Tom Lewis announced his retirement. I want to take a moment to thank Tom for leading the Company as CEO for over 16 years and helping produce outstanding results for our shareholders. So Tom, if you’re listening out there. Thanks. With that I’d like to open it up for questions. Craig.
Operator: Thank you very much. (Operator Instructions) And our first question does come from the line of Daniel Donlan with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.
Daniel Donlan - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.: Thank you and good afternoon.
John P. Case: Hi, Dan.
Paul M. Meurer: Hi, Dan.
Daniel Donlan - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.: A couple of questions here on the office that you guys acquired in the quarter, could you maybe tell us if that was kind of above that 7.1% cash cap rate range or was it above it or where did this come in if possible?
John P. Case: Yeah so, on the office activity for the quarter which represented about 18% of the quarterly volume, we’re not at liberty to discuss the exact economics there. It was a situation where we invested in the office facilities that went out of our largest retail clients within investment grade rating. They brought the opportunity to us, and it was an attractive opportunity on an economic basis with the added benefit of enhancing our overall relationship with that tenant. We’re not at liberty to discuss the economics related to the transaction there.
Daniel Donlan - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.: Sure, understood. And then just, as far as of the third quarter activity was concerned, how much was sourced directly from tenants or retailers versus market transactions?
John P. Case: Yeah, I’d say around 30% to 40% was directly sourced from relationships with tenants and other retailers, and the rest was sourced either from private developers or private owners or through marketed transactions through the advisory and brokerage community.
Daniel Donlan - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.: Okay, I appreciate the color there. And then, just two questions for Paul. Paul, it looks like your stock comp as a percentage of G&A is kind of moving towards this 30% number. I think previously it’d be kind of in the low-to-mid 20% range. Should we expect that level of stock comp as a percentage of overall G&A going forward?
Paul M. Meurer: No. I think this year you’re seeing two events. One was the July acceleration relative to the old 10 year vesting converting to the 5 year which is our stock best now for all outstanding old 10 year grants. And then the other is the process of our transition at the executive suite level and as it relates to what would, I would just describe a slight anomaly in the level of stock issuance this year now versus the run rate going forward.
Daniel Donlan - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.: Okay. I guess given that your AFFO is equal to your FFO, are you going to see then since you’ll probably going to have less stock comp next year, are you going to see maybe a drop off then in CapEx versus what you recognized this year?
Paul M. Meurer: That’s part of it. The other thing you’re seeing in the AFFO calculation is a little bit more amortization related to above market leases in our FAS 141 work if you will. So there’s offsetting factors there that historically we didn’t have in the portfolio, whether it be assumed mortgages or assumed existing leases and the accounting related to them that created -- create differentials between FFO and AFFO. In the past all we had was adding back amortization of financing cost of dot comp offset by straight line rent in CapEx. As for CapEx specifically to answer your question, we see a similar run rate for next year, call it a $8 million projected number as it relates to 2013 as a whole and 2014 as a whole.
Daniel Donlan - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co.: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question does come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America.
Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good afternoon, guys. I was just wondering for 2014 kind of what you're penciling in for acquisitions, I don't think you touched on that in the prepared remarks and as well as on same-store rent growth?
Paul M. Meurer: Sure. We are expecting approximately 1 billion in acquisitions at roughly on the yields we are seeing today in the market, so that's what we budgeted for 2014. And with regard to same-store rents, we think they'll continue around 1.3% or be perhaps a bit higher. So those are the numbers we're using in our estimates for 2014.
Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. In the acquisition pipelines you look at, are you guys looking at all or interested going forward to looking at potential public transactions for publicly traded companies?
John P. Case: We look at really everything that comes across our desk. And I'd say that as the largest player in the sector and one of the more active players in the sector with a long successful history, we believe we see most major opportunities whether it be at the property level, property portfolio level or entity level. So we'll consider all of that but it will need to meet our investment strategies. So we've been, as Sumit mentioned, quite selective this year relative to the transactions we sourced and a lot of that is just remaining true to what we want to accomplish with the portfolio. So we've passed on a number of opportunities obviously based on the source transactions and what we've done year-to-date.
Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just one other quick question. With regards to the payout ratio, it seems like CapEx is going to be fairly stable but as we think of the portfolio longer term with a greater percentage of office and industrial versus your historical retail focus, how should we think of CapEx as leases mature and kind of thinking about your payout ratio needing to retain presumably some CapEx to re-lease this space?
John P. Case: Yes, that's a good question and we're comfortable with it at 89% as I said, but we would expect it to move into probably the mid 80s over time and that's primarily to accommodate a little bit more on the CapEx side associated with the non-retail properties.
Juan Sanabria - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question does come from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions guys.
John P. Case: Hi, Manny.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: Maybe with the CEO transition, could we discuss any potential changes in strategy or should we just expect status quo going forward?
John P. Case: Yes. I don't see any major changes in strategy. We're going to remain careful and selective in our underwriting approach. We'll maintain our conservative balance sheet philosophy and our focus will be on the income generation from which we pay dividends that we intend to increase over time. The core team remains in place as you well know and Tom will continue as Vice Chairman of the Board and he's also serving as an executive advisor. So we see a fair amount of him. One thing I am looking at are our internal systems and staffing and making sure we're adequately structured for the anticipated growth we'll have in the future on those fronts, so we could see a few changes on that front or some additions, I should say. But overall the successful philosophy we've implemented here over the last cycle will continue.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: And then maybe we can go back to that point that you had made on G&A earlier and that's – you're building up sort of staffing to deal with a larger portfolio. Then you can staff [ph] it to what you guys did when you bought ARCT where you didn't bring any staff on board. Can you help me kind of connect the dots and why didn't you bring any ARCT people on board if you're going to effectively higher and how do we think that's scalability going forward? I think the triple net model has always worked as one where you need kind of limited heads to make a model work and so how do we think about that?
John P. Case: Yes. Well, our staffing our grown less than our overall portfolio has grown, so the business remains scalable. A lot of the staff being – we've added and we're considering adding is related to what we anticipate will be additional growth in the future. We were able to take on the ARCT acquisition without bringing in any of their people and do it primarily in-house. Historically, our G&A has run probably between 7.5% to 8% of revenues, it's going to be just over 7% I think for this year. We would expect that number to decline closer to 6% of revenues next year. So you can see the impact of the scalability.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: Thanks, guys.
John P. Case: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question does come from the line of Jonathan Pong with Robert W. Baird.
Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Just like to dig in a little bit on the office asset topic and maybe just what you guys think about your exposure going forward. You had about 6% today. Are you thinking about doing just more of these strategic types of deals or could you see that percentage moving higher because you see attractive risk reward on a valuation basis for these assets?
John P. Case: Yes. With regard to office, typically when we acquire office, it's part of a broader portfolio of properties that we like that happens to have an office component. There are a couple of exceptions to that. One is, if we find a facility that is associated with the retail operations of one of our major tenants and they asked us to take a lot at that, we'll pursue that on a one-off basis. But our real emphasis continues to be on retail as demonstrated by the completed acquisitions to-date as well as industrial and distribution, leased investment grade tenants with tenants that have – generally Fortune 1000 characteristics and good revenue basis and are in industries that we're comfortable with and locations that are strategic to their business. So on the office front that was a heavy quarter for us on the office side and I really wouldn't expect that sort of percentages going forward. So with regard to office, those are our views Jonathan.
Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird: Great, thanks. And maybe on the implied guidance for fourth quarter acquisition activity, just being a little conservative about a 130 million, are you seeing a slowdown in attractive opportunities for the one-off deals and I hear what you're saying on the M&A side, but are you seeing people pulling back a bit on sourcing for the one-off ones?
John P. Case: Yes. Well, as you know our acquisitions have always been lumpy. That's the word we just use to describe on. In the first quarter of this year they were 128 million at the property level, 738 million in the second quarter which was a record quarter and then another heavy quarter, 502 million. So 75% of these acquisitions really come in, in the form of portfolios. And if you miss a portfolio or two or win a portfolio or two, it can really swing your numbers. And then if they slip a date or move up a couple of weeks into a new quarter, they can really make the quarters quite lumpy. So it's never been a smooth acquisition process for us. We have pretty good visibility with just a couple of months remaining in the year, so we feel comfortable with approximately 1.5 billion in guidance we've given you.
Jonathan Pong - Robert W. Baird: Great. Thanks for the color.
John P. Case: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question does come from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations John. Wondering if you could touch upon the disposition side of the equation, I think you guys had done an extensive analysis in the past of all the properties you wanted to sell, so want to get some color on where you guys are in the process of that and how big is the bucket?
John P. Case: Yes, with regard to dispositions we're going to end up the year having about 125 million which is a pretty good number for us in terms of size. Last year that was closer to 50 million. Next year we're anticipating in access of 75 million to 100 million. And most of what we're selling is kind of coming out – is our kind of bottom bucket which is sort of a watchlist. And as we've grown the company through acquisitions and made dispositions, we brought the watch list down of a black as we call it group of companies from 23% in July of 2011 to 9% today. Now, that doesn’t mean we want to sell everything that’s in that 9% category. That just means those are properties that we’re watching, maybe we have industry concerns or credit concerns or specific real estate concerns. So, generally the dispositions will come out of that pool. So we’ll remain active on that front. But as you know our ability to transact in very large quantities there is offset by what we acquire in order to minimize the dilution from the activities. We normally budget on the property dispositions 8% sales cap rates or say that that’s a bit conservative. This year we run around the mid 7’s in terms of sales cap rates and we’re pleased with that, but we’ll continue to budget through conservatisms right around an 8% for the disposition cap rates.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks for the color.
John P. Case: Sure.
Operator: And our next question does come from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS.
John P. Case: Hi, Ross.
Ross Nussbaum - UBS: Hi, guys, good afternoon. I missed the last quarter’s call, so I’d be remiss if I just didn’t give a big shout out to Tom, and I had the pleasure working with him for most of his 16 years with the Company, and I always said I thought he was one of the most underappreciated CEO’s in the business. That means John; you’ve got some big shoes to fill.
John P. Case: I’m aware of that. Thanks.
Ross Nussbaum - UBS: So, now with that I can give you a hard time. Can we talk a little bit, and I might have missed this; did you give the underlying assumption behind that 5% of 8% FFO growth next year. What's the acquisition volume that’s behind that?
John P. Case: Yeah, it's approximately $1 billion at cap rates consistent or in the area of where we’re seeing them today, so below 7’s.
Ross Nussbaum - UBS: Got it, okay. And can we talk a little more about your portfolio strategy, because if I think about the last couple of decades at Realty Income, and I think about the ARCT transaction that took place, that was the first in my mind, the first big departure in terms of buying a large group of assets at a premium to what was then the NAV. So as you look at acquisitions going forward, can you talk a little bit about, how do you balance what the underlying market real estate value is versus how accretive that portfolio might be to your bottom line, because as I am sure you know the math works out that you could pay all-day long 10% and 20% premiums to what an asset or portfolio is worth and still make it accretive.
John P. Case: Right. Well; we’re out there and I think we’re as active as anyone in the sector in terms of investing and purchasing property, so it's important to us to do transactions that are accretive. But it's also very important for us to be protected relevant to replacement costs and relevant to market rents. So we look at all of that. In terms of asset values, yeah we see transactions that we like where we don’t lend those due to pricing. So, we try to be quite cognizant of that. I mean ARCT was a transaction that accomplished a lot for us on the strategic side. And as you know we financed it, two thirds equity, one third debt and locked in the spreads there. It was at a cap rate that was below what we were achieving at the time on our organic property level acquisitions that was in the high 5’s, but we looked at that transaction differently than we do some of our property level organic acquisitions.
Ross Nussbaum - UBS: Yeah. And that’s sort of where I am going, because as you might expect we have received quite a few phone calls over the last week or two from folks wondering if you would be interested in going in and topping ARCT’s deal with coal, basically on the same premise, that hey you’ve paid big premiums to NAV before you can still make the deal accretive. So, can we maybe just nip that one in the bud to start with? I mean do you have any intent of, is coal on the table for you or were not?
John P. Case: Well we don’t comment on pending merger and acquisition activity. I will say this, with regard to the activity that’s occurred in the sector, I think its positive. We’ve seen a lot of private to public consolidation, public-to-public consolidation in the sector, which I think attracts more interest into the sector. And being the largest company with the longest operating track record, I think that interest in the sector with new investors and new awareness can only help us. But I cant speak specifically as on any pending acquisition opportunities.
Ross Nussbaum - UBS: Okay. Let me see if I can tackle this way strategically, so clearly the ARCT deal was a bit of a game changer for you strategically. Are you -- is the portfolio at where you would like it to be from that perspective or do you feel like you need another quote unquote game changing transaction to ultimately meet your strategic goals?
John P. Case: Yes. Well, ARCT was a very, very strong strategic bid for us. And when we pursue entity level acquisitions, we look for a number of checks, the transaction needs to be immediately accretive as our team was on a leveraged neutral basis. It needs to generally improve our overall diversification and our portfolio credit quality. Ideally it would improve occupancy and link in our average remaining lease terms and reduce concentrations in our portfolio. We see few of those opportunities, but ARCT was one of that.
Ross Nussbaum - UBS: Okay. Thanks, John. I appreciate it.
John P. Case: Thanks, Ross.
Operator: And our next question does come from the line of Todd Lukasik with Morningstar.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions.
John P. Case: Hi, Todd. Yes.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Just to follow along the same line of questioning there with regards to the large entity deals. The ones that you’ve seen come across the desk recently have they been relatively quick no’s or have they been interesting enough where you spend a lot of time looking at them and the final details just didn’t work out?
John P. Case: Yes. We thoroughly analyzed everything that comes through the door with our acquisitions team and the broader team here and make decisions either prior to investment committee or within the investment committee in terms of what we do on all acquisition. So seldom do we dismiss things quickly, but it does happen.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Okay. And then just on the acquisitions guidance for 2014, of the roughly $1 billion, would you expect more of that to be in the investment grade area or the non-investment grade area? And what’s the spread that you’re seeing between those initial yields today?
John P. Case: I would think that it would be consistent with the percentages we’ve seen this year maybe a little bit lower in terms of spreads, Sumit touched on those. The cap rates seem to have stabilized and adjusted to the change in capital costs that occurred really in May. So cap rate seem to be holding steady at where they’re today. In terms of spreads, our spreads are actually debt or relative to our weighted average cost of capital on our acquisitions this quarter than where they’ve been historically. We are running in at about a 165 basis points spread relative to our weighted average cost of capital currently and over the life of the Company that’s been about 145 basis points. So our spreads to debt have gotten better, while our -- as Sumit mentioned, our spreads to our nominal cost of equity have come down a little bit to the average levels during the life of the Company. So I think those spreads, I mean, I don’t know where our capital will be priced next year, but we’re anticipating those spreads to hold for now.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Okay. And then maybe a couple of questions for you too Paul, if you could just first comment on what was in the other revenue line this quarter and accounting for that increase? And then secondly, I don't know if there were any takeaways from the increase with the revolver, but I'm wondering if one of them is that you guys keep a balance on there, accumulating a little longer and go to market with larger capital transactions like we've seen recently?
Paul M. Meurer: Yes. The other income line is one that I typically don't comment on because it's not a line that we want people to kind of underwrite from a run rate perceptive. It typically includes ongoing property level type issues like easement or eminent domain takings where you receive a payment. Those are usually very positive cash flow transactions by the way, but they flow into that line as well as interest income that we might have, cash on hand, rent come in early if you raise money that sits for a week before you invest it into that nature, it kind of flows into that line. So it's not one that we try to project out and have people underwrite in their projections or earnings for us. But there's always going to be something there and that's what fell into that line as is the norm. In terms of the credit line, yes, we're real pleased with our existing bank group of 15 lenders all saying yes and participating in the increase there and the exercise of our accordion. And what it does do it give us more flexibility. John referenced on the acquisition front gives us more flexibility. The ability for Sumit to proceed with LOIs [ph] that have no financing contingency in them because we have a large line to draw upon so that it makes your offer naturally stronger when you have the ability to do that. And then yes, on the permanent capital financing front gives us more flexibility and patience to wait for the appropriate market windows, whether that be for equity or bonds or preferred, but to be able to carry a little bit of balance and wait for a good market window in order to raise the permanent capital. So it kind of gives us flexibility on the front-end with acquisitions but also in the capital markets front as well.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.
John P. Case: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question does come from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo: Hi. Thanks guys. Is your visibility – would you say is your visibility better on deal flow as we sit here today? I mean if you look back to this time last year, your original guidance for 2013 was 550 million and now you're saying you could do 1 billion next year. Is that just a reflection that you're a bigger company at this point or is there anything to kind of look at the pace of deal flow?
John P. Case: Well, we're seeing activity based on our sourcing numbers which are very high, so we continue to work some of that. So we do have some visibility over the next few quarters and Todd it remains very difficult to predict and project, but we thought that it would be more appropriate to come out with a number of approximately 1 billion next year. And part of that is guided based upon our view of what's happening today and may spillover into the early part of next year.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo: Okay. Thanks, John. And you also indicated with the office property acquisition that you highlighted or a previous caller highlighted, lease back to your second large retail tenant that did not close yet. Did I get that right?
John P. Case: No, it's closed.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo: It's closed. You can't disclose any color on that?
John P. Case: No, we can't subject to the confidentiality agreement we signed with the tenant.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo: Will that unlock at some point to get more information or is that – what kind of window is that?
John P. Case: It's as long as we own the building.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo: Okay. And just switching gears, Paul, your operating expenses I think you indicated that you can kind of look at maybe a $20 million number for next year. What is in that number? What kind of property operating expenses would Reality Income be responsible for?
Paul M. Meurer: Yes, we historically as you know the property expense line was going to be related to taxes, maintenance, insurance, utilities all on vacant properties. So it was catch on a line for the 50 to 100 properties in any given point in time that we were carrying until we re-lease them or sold them, but we were responsible for those expenses. That was a different number. That was a number that was more in the $12 million to $13 million, $14 million type range I'd call it. And that is still in that number and part of that. The reason it's increased a bit from a run rate obviously, it's still a pretty manageable number is that we have had a portion of our portfolio grow into more of a double net structure. Some assets that we bought do have leases that give us some responsibilities as landlord. That's primarily [indiscernible]. Those costs are not – on an order of magnitude there are concerning, the ones that we budget for and they could range from $0.05 a square foot to $0.30 a square foot, if you will, in terms of what we're budgeting for those. And that's what has increased that run rate. It started to hit the $50 million area beginning of the year and now we're looking at more of a $20 million of run rate into next year as we look at our existing portfolio.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo: Thanks for that. Would you purchase new acquisitions in the double net lease or is that just going to be legacy assets?
Paul M. Meurer: Well, I think we'll be open-minded.
John P. Case: Yes, we'll be open-minded. I think it depends on what the property is and the overall return and economics. But in the industrial sector they often refer to triple net lease in a manner that's different than we do in the retail sector and it's triple net and that the tenant is responsible for maintenance, insurance and taxes, but there may be some structural components that the landlord is responsible for and that's the primary difference and that's what Paul was alluding to.
Paul M. Meurer: So having those responsibilities would not preclude us from pursuing the right assets there, Todd.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo: Okay. Thanks guys.
Paul M. Meurer: Thanks, Todd.
John P. Case: Thank you.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-07-26 16:30:00) =====
Executives:  Tom Lewis – CEO Paul Meurer – EVP, CFO and Treasurer Sumit Roy – EVP, Acquisitions
Analysts:  Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch R.J. Milligan – Raymond James & Associates Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird Todd Stender – Wells Fargo 
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2013 Earnings conference call. During today’s presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today Thursday, July 25, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.
Tom Lewis: Great. Thank you, Sheryl and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the conference call and thank you for joining us. In the room with me today, I have Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Pfeiffer, our EVP, General Counsel; and Sumit Roy, our Executive Vice President, Acquisitions. And as always during this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in the forward-looking statement. We will disclose in greater detail on the company’s Form 10-Q the factors that may cause such differences. And as is our custom, why don’t we start with Paul to walk through the quarter.
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Tom. As usual, I’ll comment briefly on our financial statements, provide a few highlights of our financial result for the quarter starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 63% for the quarter. Our current revenue on an annualized basis now is approximately $765 million. And of course this increase reflects positive same-store rents of 1.1%, but more significantly it obviously reflects our growth from new acquisitions over the past year. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased significantly to $78 million in the quarter as depreciation expense has obviously increased naturally with our portfolio growth. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $39.1 million. This increase was primarily due to the $800 million of bonds that were issued last October as well as some credit facility borrowings during the past quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong with interest coverage at 4.1 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.3 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the second quarter were approximately $12 million dollars. Our G&A expenses naturally increased this past year as our acquisition activity has increased and we added some new personnel to manage a larger portfolio. Our employee base has grown from 89 employees a year ago to 104 employees at quarter end. However, our total G&A as a percentage of total revenues has decreased to only 6.5% and this compares to a historic run rate for G&A of about 7.5% to 8% of revenues. Our current projection for G&A for all of 2013 is about $58 million. Property expenses were just under $3.3 million for the quarter and our property expense estimate for all of 2013 remains about $15 million. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company. They were $722,000 for the quarter. Merger-related costs, obviously this line item refers to the costs associated with the ARCT acquisition. During the quarter, we expensed $605,000 of such remaining costs. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $3.9 million. This income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We sold 17 properties during the quarter for $23.7 million with gain on sales of $5.7 million. And just a reminder that we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest refers to the limited partners of the operating partnership that we purchased in the ARCT acquisition and a new Realty Income LP, we formed this past quarter. The assets and operations of these two subsidiary partnerships are 100% consolidated into Realty Income. Preferred stock cash dividend totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter. Net income available to common stockholders was about $44.2 million for the quarter. Reminder that our normalized FFO simply add back the ARCT merger-related costs to FFO. We believe normalized FFO is a more appropriate portrayal of our operating performance and it’s consistent with our public FFO earnings estimates and first call FFO estimates that analysts have published on us. Normalized FFO per share was $0.51 for the quarter, a 24.5% increase versus a year ago. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash that we have available for distribution as dividend was $0.59 per share for the quarter, an 18% increase versus a year ago. We again increased our cash monthly dividend this quarter. We have increased the dividend 63 consecutive quarters and 72 times overall since we went public over 18.5 years ago. Dividends paid per common share increased 24.5% this quarter versus the same quarterly period a year ago. Our current monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of approximately $2.179 per share. Our AFFO dividend payout ratio year-to-date has been 87%. Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. Earlier this month as you know, we raised $750 million of new capital with a 10-year bond offering at 4.65%. Our $1 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility currently has zero borrowings and this facility also has a $500 million accordion expansion feature. We assumed approximately $65 million of in-place mortgages during the quarter as part of our property acquisitions. We now have 51 assumed mortgages on 229 properties, totaling approximately $793 million. Our upcoming mortgage maturities though are only $24 million the reminder of this year and $64 million in 2014. Our next bond maturity is only $150 million, which is not due until November of 2015. Our overall current total debt to total market cap is 29.5% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 4.5% of our current capital structure. So, in summary, revenue growth this quarter was significant and our expenses remain moderate so our earnings growth was very positive. And our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and safe and we continue to enjoy excellent access to the public capital markets to fund our continued growth. Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom, who’ll give a little bit more background on these results.
Tom Lewis: Thank you, Paul. Let me start just by saying I think in the second quarter, we continued pretty good positive momentum from the first quarter and had I think, excellent results in each facet of the business and I’ll start with the portfolio, which again generated very consistent income during the quarter pretty much across the board the tenants are doing well no issues arose with any of the tenants during the quarter and based on what we see now that should be the case during the third quarter very, very smooth. At the end of the quarter, our largest 15 tenants and they are listed in the release accounted for 43.5% of our revenue that’s down 500 basis points from the same period a year ago and up 90 from the first quarter. There may be some I think ebb and flow from quarter-to-quarter in that but our acquisition efforts continue to help us reduce concentrations pretty much throughout the portfolio. And we have made continuous progress in that over time. If you look back say five years ago to 2008, our top 15 tenants accounted for 54.3% of our business, of our revenue and today that’s 43.5%. Relative to occupancy, we ended the quarter at 98.2% with 68 properties available for lease out of the 3,681 we own that occupancy is up 50 basis points from the first quarter and up 90 basis points from the same quarter a year ago and really is a function of very good progress on leasing during the quarter. And I would say looking forward here in the third quarter, we think occupancy should remain at this level or perhaps up a bit more and overall occupancy is very strong. We reported occupancy this way for very long time, which is taking vacant buildings against those that are occupied to figure those numbers. There is another way to do it. We can do it by vacant square footage and divided by total square footage that would give you occupancy of 90% or the third way is to take previous rent on vacant properties and divide that by the sum of that number and the rent on occupied properties and if you use that methodology vacancy is only 0.9% and occupancy 99.1%. So, each obviously of the three methodologies indicates very good occupancy. Same-store rents on the portfolio increased 1.1% during the second quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. As you recall, during last year, same-store rent was just modestly positive for the year so getting back up to a run rate of 1% plus is pretty good. And I think a good rate for the portfolio and we think that will continue over the next few quarters. Diversification of the portfolio continues to widened we are up to 3,681 properties we have 194 tents we’re in 46 industries and 49 states around the country. I think industry exposures are well diversified given we have 46 industries and the concentrations on the major ones continue to come down a bit and this has been going on really for the last few years. Our largest industry right now is convenient stores that’s at a 11.4% that’s down 60 basis points from last quarter and 550 basis points from a year ago that was once closed to 20% of the portfolio and so getting it down and inside 10% is something we want to do. Restaurants if you were to combine both categories casual dining and quick service we now have down to 9.9% or below 10 that’s down 60 basis points from last quarter and 390 basis points from a year ago and I’ll note that was once 22% of revenue. We then jumped to drug stores at 6.9% theatres at 6.3% and health and fitness and transportation at 5.9% and then dollar scores at 5.6% and all of the other industry categories that we have are under 4%. So I think pretty good shape and keeping an eye on concentrations by industry. I think that’s true also from a tenant standpoint. Our top three tenants number one is FedEx at 4.3% that’s down 40 basis points from last quarter. L.A. Fitness is at 4.5%, Walgreens which we have been adding to the portfolio is at 4.1% that’s up about a 120 basis points and every other tenant we have is below 3.5% and when you get to the 15th largest tenant which is Wal-Mart Sam’s Club. You are looking really only to about 1.7% of revenue and it goes down from there. So certainly well diversified from a tenant and we also think geographic standpoint. Average remaining lease term remains very positive at a 11 years and overall we are really pleased with the portfolio and it’s generating very consistent income with very high occupancy. Relative to portfolio dispositions. We continue to sell some properties out of the portfolio during the quarter. The goal obviously is further strengthening the credit quality, the portfolio and doing that by reducing exposures to industry and tenants and properties where we think they might be particularly sensitive to reduce economic activity or a slowdown in the economy. We are also maybe with tenants whose balance sheets are significantly levered and might be impacted by higher interest rates and that has been a theme for us for a while. Paul mentioned during the quarter we sold 17 properties for $23 million. For the year it’s 34 properties with $83 million. For those that are on the call on a regular basis you will recall that our goal was over a $100 million and perhaps up to a $125 million and sales will have been flow on a quarter-by-quarter basis but $100 million plus is definitely where we are heading and where most of the way they are now and we may up that estimate in the coming quarters and do some additional dispositions above and beyond that. And once again the sales primarily during the quarter we are in the restaurant industry which we continue to reduce and the child daycare industry and both are targeted we would like to sell off some properties in those area. I think overall we are very pleased with the operations of the portfolio and have made good progress. Let me move over to property acquisition for a moment. As I’ve said virtually every quarter forever but it’s a good remainder acquisitions can be quite lumpy quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year and a challenge to predict certainly by the quarter and that continues to be the case. In the second quarter we were very active on the acquisitions front and pleased with the really high level of activity in acquisitions. We acquired $738 million in properties invested in a 190 different properties and that is the most accusative quarter for property level acquisition in the company’s history and average cash on cash cap rates were at 6.8% kept nice along lease terms and the acquisitions at 14 years and also 70% of the properties acquired during the quarter were leased to investment grade tenants as most of you know that has been one of our focuses. Also good diversity they released a 19 different tenants in 16 industries with the most significant industries represented were in drug stores, wholesale clubs and in convenient stores and well diversified geographically in 32 states and 90% of the acquisitions during the quarter were in our traditional retail properties that gets us for the first six months of the year then to $867 million that we invested in 206 properties. Cap rates there 7% and long-term leases again at 14 years and about 61% of the acquisitions leased to investment grade tenant. That’s obviously well above at 860 excuse me $867 million our initial full year 2013 guidance of $550 million. Couple of weeks ago we’ve bumped that guidance up in excess of $1 billion and given really some transactions that have come to fruition in the last few days yesterday in the release we changed that to $1.25 billion and very, very pleased with that process but we think a good share of him as we get now later in the year we’ll close towards the end of the third and fourth quarter that’s fairly typical. And so the impact to 2013 numbers maybe modest depending on when the closings actually happened but obviously very accretive to the 2014 numbers and that $1.25 billion will be in addition to the $3.2 billion acquisition of ARCT that we did in the first quarter. Looking at transaction flow I talked about it being very, very robust last quarter and it’s really been a record amount of flow that has come into the market substantially. During first six months of the year we’ve sourced about $20 billion in acquisition opportunities that have come through the door and $15 billion of that alone came in the door during the second quarter. To put that in perspective that’s more in sourced acquisition opportunities year to-date then we’ve ever seen in a full calendar year. Last year was very heavy year for acquisition opportunities at $17 billion. The year before was $13 billion and previous to that it had never really exceeded much over $5 billion so the $15 billion during the quarter and $20 billion year to-date represents really just a stunning level of opportunities that were out there in the market place with people bringing properties out for sale. A number of those as some people have probably noticed we’re large portfolio entity level acquisition opportunities but also there were a lot of very small kind of granular individual property opportunities that came to market during the quarter so it remain very active. I think we remained very selective in the acquisitions and have been trying to pursue only those things that match where we are trying to take the portfolio strategically and we continue to look at few of the acquisition opportunities that came into the second quarter but have elected not to pursue the vast majority of them. And again number of the transactions for us had issues relative to the industries the tenants were in and who the consumers are also with pricing and structure. And I think it’s generally been the case then in the large portfolio unless the overwhelming vast majority of the properties fit the invest strategy will likely elect to pass on them and not pursue growth just for gross purposes but overall obviously very pleased with acquisition volume and also very pleased that in past years and we had some descent size acquisitions go through this quarter that just as I said a moment ago a lot of the acquisitions have been property by property and smaller organic level transactions and really allowed us to make some good progress with the portfolio. Let me talk to pricing and cap rates which I think is really interesting. Cap rates have ticked up a bit over the last six weeks or so as we saw movement in rates in the capital markets. Cap rates started moving and at the same time and probably seen about a 25 basis point move up in cap rates overall just in the last six weeks or so. And historically that does not usually happened this fast and usually it takes longer for cap rates to adjust movements in the capital markets and sometimes they may even lag by six to 12 months. And in the recent kind of movement in the capital markets things seem a bit different this time and put some thought to it and I think the reason that the cap rates started to moving quicker this time is that more and more of the acquirers in the net lease business now are institutional buyers such as ourselves certainly then was the case in the past. And I think our business historically has been dominated by a very large group of one-off transactions primarily driven by individual investors that had a big impact on the pricing in the market and that’s flip-flopped a bit as more institutional buyers have emerged and it’s a smaller group albeit of large players that seem to be impact the pricing. So really a movement in the cap rates stands by a few larger buyers, I think like can adjust cap rates a bit faster than what we’ve traditionally seen in the net lease market for a very long time and I think that’s been the case here. In the market right now investment grade properties – properties leased to investment grade tenants cap rates have moved kind of in the 6.25% up to 7.25% certainly up 25 basis points maybe a few basis points more, and I think the same thing with non-investment grade cap rates which were in the 7.25% to 8.25% range also up 25 basis points and again that’s just really over the last five, six weeks or so and normally I’d wonder about that and wonder if its anecdotal but, given the flow and the volume of activity that we see and that we’re working on I think it’s pretty representative of what’s going out happening in the market. So caps moving up with capital cost this quickly as unusual, but obviously we’re pleased by that. Looking at spreads, our investment spreads remained very healthy in the second quarter, as I mentioned a minute ago invested $866.5 million at a 7 cap rate. We financed basically almost all of that recently with the 10 year unsecured bond offering that Paul talked about with a 4, 6, 5 coupon, so a spread of little over 230 basis points which is excellent and that’s pretty much everything that we’ve done year-to-date. And as we frequently discuss, when we talk about spreads historically, we’ve looked at our spreads first relative to a nominal cost of equity which is taking a forward FFO yield dividing it by the price of the stock and then grossing it up for issuance cost. And if you look back over the last 20 years that spread over a nominal cost of equity is averaged about a 112 basis points and I had mentioned that during the last 20 years the vast majority of the time we were acquiring properties leased to less than investment grade tenants. And if you look today with well over half of the acquisitions little over 60% going to investment grade tenants cap rates for the first six months were at 7% and that nets you about a 130 basis point spread to the nominal cost of capital if you calculated it where we are today. And that’s a good 20 basis points over the 20 year historical average. So in a little a bit, but still quite healthy and then relative to what we did in the quarters obviously spreads are higher using debt issuance. So I think we still like the spreads relative to what we’ve achieved historically out there when most of our acquisitions were less than investment grade and today the majority are investment grade and obviously on the spread fund caps – cap rates ticking up a bit is helpful. Relative to the volume and what we’re looking at going forward, we feel it is still a very robust market with a lot of product to look at, we’d be very surprised to see the volume of opportunities in the third and fourth quarters that we saw in the second quarter, the $15 billion again was pretty exceptional. But going forward there is still very active flow and we expect our activity there to remain pretty robust remainder of the year, but likely as always continue to be lumpy, but we’re very optimistic we’ll have a banner year. You noticed in the release, we moved the estimate as I mentioned to $1.25 billion we’re highly confident on that and then we’ll see if we can make some additional progress for the remainder of the year, very positive on acquisitions. Let me just get back to the portfolio for a second and all this acquisition activity obviously has had a big impact on the financials, revenue earnings and dividend which is apparent the number is here. But it’s also had a material impact on the makeup of our portfolio and where we’re trying to move it up to credit curve and we continue to make good progress on that. The percentage of our revenue during the quarter that is generated by investment grade tenants was up to 38.2% for the quarter that’s up 240 basis points over the first quarter and I just to update a few numbers here that I went through in the first quarter and I think it’s helpful to do. Over the last 36 months or so we’ve acquired about $6.6 billion in property about $4.5 billion of that is in retail which is traditional for us and sectors that we think will continue to perform well if we get a tough retail environment goes on. And then $2.1 billion we’ve acquired in areas outside of retail almost all investment grade that we think will do well for us. Out of that $6.6 billion, $4.1 billion or 62% has been with investment grade tenants and a good part; I think of the balance of the acquisitions will amount our investment grades certainly are further up the credit curve than we had averaged in the portfolio just a few years ago. Some other interesting numbers and I’ll track this back over the last five years from 2008, as I mentioned earlier in 2008 the top 15 tenants did 54.3% of our business, if you look at their average DAR score and as a lot of you know that’s the credit score internally we use that approximates the credit score somewhere to what the rating agencies do. The DAR score on average for the top 15 tenants was a 6.92 which equates to about a BB minus credit rating and in 2008 none of the top 15 tenants had investment grade ratings. Today the top 15 do 43.5% of the revenue that average DAR score is now 11.78 which approximates to about a really BBB that closer to a BBB plus credit rating that’s up substantially and eight of the top 15 tenants now carry investment grade ratings. So if you look at really in the last for the top 15, 4.5 years percentage of revenue from 54% to 43%, the DAR score from 6.92 to 11.78 and then from zero to eight of the top 15 tenants with investment grade ratings, and so pretty pleased with – with those trends. At a couple of the industry meetings lately and I’ve alluded to this on the call there is another way to look at the adjustments, I’ll spend a minute on and if you go back two years ago from right now in July of 2011 we went back and re-underwrote our largest tenants, we did that for 67 tenants that produced 83% of our revenue and really did that using 19 different metrics to try and assess the risks that they might represent to our revenue stream in a rising interest rate environment or a weak economy and it included rankings on each industry based on that industry and how it operates just margins and the consumer that really they serve, an analysis of concentrations, balance sheet and income statement analysis and then a pretty heavy sensitivity analysis where we stress tested them moving their revenue and their margins and then their sensitivity to interest rates on refinance and their balance sheets. And based on that if you took the portfolio at least the 67 tenants that did 83% of our revenues, we broke them up into four categories and I’ll do and one is green, which is strong buy, one is yellow which is buy, red which hold, black what you sell. And back in 2011 tenants representing about 22.8% of our revenue were in the green strong buy category, 21.4% in the yellow or buy category, about 15.9% in that red or hold category and then 22.9% in the black or sell. And again they represented about 83% of our revenue. Pretty much two years here exactly we just recently updated that and given the pretty robust acquisition and disposition activity, we now do that each quarter and it represents a 121 tenants that do 88.1% of our revenue, but if you look at the breakdown today the green or strong buy category tenants in that category have moved from 22.8% of our revenue in 2011 to today over 45.1%. In the yellow and buy its gone from 21.4% to down a bit 18.4% in the red from 15.9% to 15.8%, but most importantly in the black or sell category which was 22.9% of our revenue in 2011, it is now 8.8% of the revenue. So substantial and I think material progress in moving the portfolio to some degree would dispositions obviously to a lesser extent, but certainly with all the acquisitions we’ve done it had a pretty material impact. Let’s move to the capital side for a minute, you know I mentioned that we’ve bought about $6.6 billion over the last three years, I think how that’s been capitalized is important, I’ll run through the numbers. We’ve issued about $1.8 billion of long-term notes or bonds at very good rates. We’ve assumed on some larger transactions about $793 million in mortgage debt. We also generated about a $178 million from property sales and then $409 million in perpetual preferred offerings, but most importantly in the last three years we’d issued equity six times during the period equivalent to about $3.7 billion. So that’s about $6.8 billion in capital total, over $4 billion of it was common and preferred and of the remaining none of the capital is variable rate most all of it long-term and I think that puts us in pretty good shape relative to if we see a further rising interest rate environment and as those of you who were on the calls know preparing for a rising rate has been a theme for us on the calls in the last three years relative to capital issuance and trying to grow up the curve. And I think we’ve been able to do this while moving the needle pretty well on FFO and dividends. Let me finish off with just a few relative access to capital now as Paul mentioned we’re in good shape, plenty of dry powder and no balance on the line and even with the tenure moving up we have accessed to capital at good rates and more importantly good spreads on the acquisitions. Earnings for the quarter as Paul mentioned, we’re very strong so let me just move on to guidance. We made the adjustments a couple of weeks ago to a $1 billion and then as I have said a couple of times up to a $1.25 billion, however on earnings guidance we did not change I mean, we did a couple of weeks ago and that is now 237 to 243 on normalized FFO and at 17% to 20% growth and on AFFO 235 to 241 or 14% to 17% growth. And even though we think acquisitions will now be larger than expect as we left the guidance where we took it a couple of weeks ago. I noticed in some of the research notes this morning there were some question on that. So let me – take a moment and kind of go through the thoughts there. we just up the guidance a couple of weeks ago by a nickel on both FFO, AFFO and it was really just some transactions coming together in the last couple of days that really made this confident to move the acquisition’s guidance too $1.25 billion and that again causes us to be very confident on current guidance. But I think there is some – variables or levers in the business I’d like to maintain some optionality on for now rather than moving guidance up further. One is the timing of the closings, and how that’s going to impact numbers, obviously sooner creates a little more FFO on the 2013 numbers than later and as we get here later in the years the acquisitions have less impact. And then next trying to discern what if any volume there is going to be above and beyond that. And I think that will lay itself out over the next couple of months or so. Next is – what are permanent capital costs, given the volatility lately we liked to hedge that a bit and so we’ve done that. And then I think also one of the levers we’d like to keep is whether or not we expand the disposition level a bit over the $100 million to $125 million level and we may do that. And then finally I think it comes down to trying to assess what type of capital we would use next, do we use equity or something else and those would have different impacts on the numbers, different share count. And – and then really it’s just you know trying to maintain some optionality primarily on capital and dispositions. So we will revisit it down the road we don’t want to get too far ahead on the numbers at least for right now, but obviously the growth numbers and the guidance having recently up to the very positive. Finally I’ll end with our for our shareholders who were primarily – who’s primary focus is dividends which as you know is a great deal of them, Paul mentioned dividends paid were up 24.5% quarter-over-quarter, we’ve increased to three times this year and we remain optimistic that our activities will support continued increases in the dividend. Want to thank you for your patience with an active quarter. And Sheryl, if you’ll come back we’ll now open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, good afternoon. I just had a quick question with regards to your capacity from a balance sheet perspective. How much could you debt fund out for you’d be a bit uncomfortable with your leverage ratio? And I guess the second question what I’ve got the floor is just what are your views on acquiring assets with lease terms below 10 years what sort of cap rate spreads, which you have to see relative to your traditional focal point?
Tom Lewis: Well from an overall leverage standpoint Juan, we historically have run kind of in the – I’ll give a broad range for a second, 20% to 35% leverage range, 5% to 15% preferred, when I referred to 35% debt and 15% preferred I’m referring to maximum that we’re comfortable with relative to that. So today debts around 30%, preferreds around 5%, we obviously do have capacity in both buckets and certainly stayed in concert with issuing equity as well. We would continue to have capacity in those buckets, but we view maximum levels of kind of a 35% debt, 15% preferred. And actually preferred that they be more in the 25% debt level and in the 5% to 10% preferred level. So we have an all phrase we use internally which is go equity first so to the extent that common equity is well priced and accretive that’s something we would – always keep our eye on as something we’d be more likely to take a look at before we looked at the fixed income side.
Paul Meurer: On the second question Juan, relative to shorter leases it has been very, very, very rare for us to go much inside 10 years the only time I can remember is when we bought a large portfolio on just a couple of three, four, five of the properties would be inside of that. We’re really trying to go longer up in the 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 to keep the lease duration on the portfolio long, and allow the revenue to be very stable. When you’re in the net lease market and you’re out there selling properties if you’re lease linked is 10 years or longer generally the cap rate will command, we’ll be much, much better than when it moves inside 10 years and as you get shorter down in the 6,5, 4 cap rates rise pretty dramatically. And that’s generally a function of released risk that is hard to tell on a lot of net lease assets. And when you’re out buying shorter-term leases generally those aren’t generated in a direct transaction with a retailer or a large corporate tenant generally you’re buying those out from another owner in the open market. And if you didn’t underwrite them to yourselves you may not have cash flow coverages or the profitability, the individual stores that you’re buying and that’s makes it difficult to assess the risk of whether the tenant will re-lease certainly in the case of retail, and you want to make sure you have that and if you didn’t have it then the cap rates going to rise because of the uncertainty relative to rollover. So you’d really have to be assessing what you paid per square foot and what the rent is per square foot, and what you think the market would be, but generally those command much higher cap rates and it’s very rare our strong, strong prejudice is not to go into that game. We’ve looked at that business may be 15 times over the last 20 years but really found it difficult to underwrite. So generally we’re looking up in the 12, 13, 15 to 20 year lease when we’re – acquiring properties.
Juan Sanabria – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of R.J. Milligan with Raymond James & Associates. Please go ahead.
R.J. Milligan – Raymond James & Associates: Hey guys, good afternoon and good evening.
Unidentified Company Speaker: Hey R.J.
R.J. Milligan – Raymond James & Associates: Just curious Tom, what – the volume – the $15 billion in the second quarter is that – was that a reaction to the tenure moving or was there something else driving that surge in volume?
Tom Lewis: Yes. And that was really pre the temper tantrum as somebody said at the other day, and the movement in the tenure because most of that that hit the market came in middle earlier the quarter and also came of course was structured before that in the decision to bring it to the market generally is a few months before that. And it’s a couple of things going on one is, is just there has been a growing knowledge of net lease sale and leaseback and I think that’s a function of a lot of the talk in the fourth quarter and the first quarter with bankers out calling on really Fortune 500 and – every tenant they have or every company they have about using the real estate take it up balance sheet. So just a wider knowledge of using sales and leaseback is part of the capital structure by corporations. I think also there is just been a lot of potential M&A transactions a number of those had been noted in the press and, those came to market and I think it was also representative the companies are figuring out the rates are pretty good, and it might be a good time to do it if you’re going to couple with some of the private REITs or fund business that is really the part of the cycle where they need to come to market and the confluence evolve so one time led to a lot coming on the market very quickly. A lot of that will get done, got done some of it won’t and then when the tenure moved you saw the – saw cap rates move a bit. But it was just a heavy quarter and it was all of those things coming together and I don’t think we’re going to see that this quarter and next quarter but the volume still remains very elevated over where it was a couple of years ago.
R.J. Milligan – Raymond James & Associates: So, it’s slowed since the middle of May or…
Tom Lewis: Yes, I mean $15 billion is a ridiculous number. But if you go back again two, three years ago I think $5 billion a year was the number and it’s certainly running way the heck ahead of that. It’s still very strong. We saw $5 billion in the first quarter and assume you want to hazard a guess so what you think we’ll see in the third and fourth…
R.J. Milligan – Raymond James & Associates: Subset of the $5 billion for the remainder of the year.
Tom Lewis: Yeah, okay.
R.J. Milligan – Raymond James & Associates: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Pong with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird: Hey, good afternoon guys.
Tom Lewis: Hey, Jonathan.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird: (inaudible) thoughts as you look at the potential large portfolio deals you have done on the publicly traded side and the non-traded side that might need a liquidity event over the next year or so. What says your appetite right now for those kinds of deals and all of equal and tenant quality lease duration, which says that the yields probably need to see between the portfolio deal and one-off deals that would make you more constructive in pursuing those?
Tom Lewis: Yes it’s really interesting – that’s an interesting question. Let me comment it a few ways. I said in last quarter’s call something very strange in the business right now is because of the additional institutional buyers. Traditionally, if you had a large portfolio transaction the cap rate on that would be higher than a one-off really rewarding the person for putting out a lot of capital in one fell swoop and starting about a year ago that all reversed as you had a number of institutional buyers, who were trying to put capital out and had raised funds and had difficulty putting it out and a one-off transaction would move the needlework for them. So, it’s only time in and then came in at $75 million or $100 million, $200 million, $300 million all of a sudden there were a lot of people looking at it and so cap rates really inverted where those were going trading inside a one-off of the same tenant. So, that’s unusual as long as I’ve been in the business but I think still where we are. And so if I – I said earlier that investment grade cap rates worth 6 in a quarter and 7 a quarter rate, I think a large transaction would fit in bidding that and same thing in a less than investment grade. And relative to us looking at them we’d love to do it. We’re more than happy to do it but one of the terms brought up here recently is given all the volume that came to market the odds were good but the goods were also odd. So, when you start looking at the quality of portfolio we’re trying to move more investment grade and there was a number of the things that came to market that were not and some that didn’t had a makeup in the portfolio. They didn’t fit some other characteristics rather the industry, who want to be in. And so, we’re really going to limit what we do on those unless the vast majority of the properties I said earlier kind of fit. But with that said we’re open to it. There is some floating out there and we’ll have to watch where they are.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird: I guess if I look further out into that pipeline that M&A pipeline are you thinking of deals that might come to market that you are sort of holding off or are you sort of taking a more short-term view?
Tom Lewis: Yeah no I mean we’re just taking them as we come. As I said, we’re really happy Sumit Roy, who is running acquisitions and John Case our Chief Investment Officer kind of took our acquisition group and split them up into different areas earlier in the year. And we’re very happy with kind of the granular one-offs that we’re able to bring in much more than in the past. And that’s really led from the reliance I think for us on larger transactions but we’re pretty happy with the volumes coming in. So, we don’t feel compelled to go out and grab them. But we’re more trying to watch what’s really steaming up out there and what would fit. And then when those come wanting to make sure that we pursue them fairly aggressively and on the other ones not a high level of interest if it doesn’t fit, where we’re trying to take the portfolio.
Jonathan Pong – Robert W. Baird: Got it. That’s helpful. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo: Hi, Tom since it’s a big number in Q2 that $15 billion that came in is that absolutely everything that’s being marketed or is that has been screened through you guys and then from there you break it down to see if it fits your long-term lease profile?
Tom Lewis: Yeah I’m sure that there were sort of things that we didn’t see particularly smaller but those are all of the things that came in the door that would reasonably be assumed that they would fit into categories that we would buy. And then we started screening and from there what happens is the acquisition group and they all have financial backgrounds do the initial screening, understanding our objectives. And they can start throwing things out pretty quick with just a day or two looking at them and trying to be more selective with what we then released and it goes over to research, the financial analysis are done and we get deep into it and then goes to the investment committee from there. So, that is the all-in kind of number of everything we see that is net lease that Realty Income would look at the category, look at the type of tenant that comes in the door.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo: And is it reasonable to assume that that could be a long runway for you guys its stuff you are looking at in Q2 could still be closing in Q4 and Q1 of next year should this really provide a pretty visible runway for acquisitions?
Tom Lewis: Sumit, why don’t you take that?
Sumit Roy: Sure. Most of the $15 billion that we referenced we’ve decided to pass on. Some of them we’ve already found out who the eventual buyer is. Some of it is still going through the process and I’m sure the eventual buyer will emerge over the next couple of quarters. But none of those $15 billion that we’ve referenced are portfolios that we’ve decided to pursue outside of the ones that we’ve either pursued or is in the pipeline to close and that’s a very, very small percentage less than 5%.
Tom Lewis: Yes. And the comfort level for the $1.25 billion is really taking those and the ones that we pursued and we are going to get and kind of looking at the timing and closing and that’s how we kind of jump from the $866 to $1.25. And there is a few exceptions but then you really want to start thinking that anything additional will come from what we’re looking at right now not what we look at last quarter.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo: And that’s helpful. And then Tom, you referenced the cap rate movement up about 25 basis points in the last six weeks. Is it fair to say that that was more on the low investment grade and that investment grade cap rates a little more sticky.
Tom Lewis: No, actually we believe they both moved. We’ve seen a lot of volume in it and that was the major point of our discussion a few days ago sitting there just parsing everything coming in the door. So, we’ve seen it across the board.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo: Okay. And then Paul you get pretty good color on how you are dealing the preferreds and it sounds like the preferreds at the bottom half of your range or what should expect maybe 5% to 10%. Can you just kind of go under what the current market pricing is for preferreds and tenant of your philosophy of convertible preferred would be considered?
Paul Meurer: The, as you know the preferred pricing widened over the last 45 days or so with the moving interest rates may be even more so than bonds. It kind of made a big jump and it’s taken a while for that to settle down. Current pricing for us would be in the 6.5% range call it from a coupon perspective. We suspect that will continue to tighten as things settle a bit in that preferred market and there is some demand on the horizon in that market but not at a level that it makes sense so for example to issue and takeout our existing preferred or that sort of thing but it is a bucket that we have capacity for and its reasonably priced and of course has a great maturity date if you will. So, it matches up well in our balance sheet for long-term assets and not matching with long-term liabilities. Convertible preferred is something we are open minded about. I think it would need to be done in concert with a larger strategic entity level type situation, where an equity element would be something to be considered. But as a normal ongoing corporate finance product in the balance sheet it’s not really how we choose to match fund our assets and not how we chose demand into the equity side of the balance sheet but it’s something we listen to. We’re open minded about and are knowledgeable about and we’d, never say never but it’s not something we look to in the near term or as a regular course of financing.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we’ll be conducting a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.
Thomas Lewis: Thank you, Tager and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call today to discuss the first quarter operations for Realty Income. Before I start, in the room with me is Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; John Case, our President and Chief Investment Officer; Paul Meurer, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Pfeiffer, our General Counsel. As always I must read and say that during this conference call we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law and the company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail on the company's Form 10-K the factors that may cause such differences. Also in the room with me today are some spring allergies so if we go radio silent for a second or you hear a loud noise I would appreciate your understanding. Paul, as we always do, if you’ll start by running through the numbers for everybody.
Paul Meurer: Thank you, Tom. As usual, I will comment on the financial statements, provide a few highlights of the financial results for the quarter and start by just walking briefly through the income statement. Total revenue increased 52.9% for the quarter. Our current revenue on an annualized basis today at 3, 31 is approximately $718 million. This increase reflects some positive same-store rent of 1.5% in the portfolio, but more significantly it obviously reflects our growth from new acquisitions over the past year. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased significantly to just under $70 million in the quarter. Of course that depreciation expense increased with our portfolio growth. Interest expense increased in the quarter to $41.5 million and this increase was primarily due to the $800 million of bond that were issued last October as well as some credit facility borrowing during the quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both improved and remain strong, with interest coverage at 3.7 times and fixed charge coverage at 3.0 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the quarter were approximately $11.6 million dollars. Our G&A expenses naturally increased this past year as our acquisition activity increased and we added some new personal to manage a larger portfolio. Our employee base has grown from 86 employees a year ago to 92 employees at quarter end. However, our total G&A as a percentage of total revenues has decreased to only 6.7%. Historically our G&A had a run rate at about 7.5% to 8% of revenue. Our current projections for G&A for all of 2013 is about $45 million. Property expenses were just $3.8 million for the quarter, these expenses historically have been primarily our carry cost associated with properties available for lease. However, as we noted last quarter, our 2013 property expense estimate is higher at about $15 million, as we have recently purchased a few double properties where we are responsible for some of the property expenses. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company and they were $671,000 for the quarter. Merger related costs, obviously this line items refers to the cost associated with the ARCT acquisition. During the quarter we expensed approximately $12 million of such costs. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $39.5 million. This income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We sold 17 properties during the quarter for $60 million with a gain on sales of $38.6 million. An important reminder that we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest refers to the limited partners of the operating partnership we purchased which holds the ARCT property. These LPs own 0.7% of the equity of the OP. All of the assets and operations of the OP are 100% consolidated into realty income. Preferred stock cash dividend totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter and net income available to common stock holders was about $61.3 million for the quarter. Reminder that our normalized FFOs simply add back the ARCT merger related costs to FFO. We believe normalized FFO is a more appropriate portrayal of our operating performance and it's consistent with our public FFO earnings estimates and our first call FFO estimates that analysts have published on us. Normalized funds from operations or FFO per share was $0.51 for the quarter, a 32.6% increase versus a year ago. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO, or the actual cash that we have available for distribution as dividends, was $0.60 per share for the quarter, a 20% increase versus a year ago. Also you will note that in our press release we continue to affirm our same earnings estimates for 2013. As you know, we have also increased our cash monthly dividend significantly over the past year. In addition to our regular quarterly increase, we did a $0.35 annualized dividend increase in January. We have increased the dividend 62 consecutive quarters and 71 times overall since we went public 18.5 years ago. Dividends paid per common share increased 17.6% this quarter versus the same quarterly period a year ago. Our current monthly dividend now equates to a current annualized amount of $2.175 per share. Our AFFO dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 86%. Briefly turning to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain a very conservative and safe capital structure. In March, we raised $755 million of new capital with a very successful common equity offering. We sincerely thank the 16 investment banks involved in the placement of our common shares with investors and their respected brokerage system. At quarter end, our $1 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility had a balance of only $116.6 million. Our credit facility also has a $500 million accordion expansion feature. We did assume approximately $565 million of in place mortgages during the quarter as part of our property acquisition, primarily in the ARCT acquisition. We now have 48 assumed mortgages on 185 properties, totaling approximately $729 million. In March, we did repay at maturity $100 million of bonds which were placed back in 2003. Our next bond maturity is only $150 million and it is due in November of 2015. Our overall current total debt to total market capitalization is 24.5% and our preferred stock outstanding is only 4.5% of our capital structure. So in summary, revenue growth this quarter was significant and our expenses remain moderate so our earnings growth was very positive. And our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and safe and we continue to enjoy excellent access to the public capital markets to fund our continued growth. Now let me turn the call back over to Tom who’ll give a little bit more background.
Thomas Lewis: Thanks Paul. I’ll start with just the general comment that was in the release which is obviously the first quarter was the best quarter I think operationally in the company’s history and each facet of the business had solid results. So we’ll keep the commentary here a little shorter than usual because I think the results speak for themselves. But let me start with the portfolio which continued to generate very consistent cash flow in the first quarter and general accounts pretty much all of the tenants are reporting doing pretty well. There are no issues that arose with any tenants during the quarter and we believe that will be the case here in the second quarter. So very smooth. At the end of the quarter, our largest 15 tenants that are listed in the release accounted for 42.6% of our revenue. That’s down 680 basis points from the same period a year ago and down 450 basis points from the fourth quarter. So the recent acquisition efforts continue to help us reduce any concentrations in the portfolio. And we made continuous progress on this over time. In 2008 the top 15 accounted for 54.3% of revenue and we’re now down to 42.6%. We ended the quarter with 97.7% occupancy and that’s 81 properties available for lease out of the 3,525 that we own. That’s up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter and 110 basis points from the same period a year ago. And here in the second quarter we would anticipate occupancy remaining very strong, likely to be flat or up slightly again this quarter and very pleased with that. I mentioned in the past there are three ways you can do occupancy. The one we use in the release is to take just the number of properties that are vacant, 81, divided by the 3,525 and that’s how we get to 97.7%. If you wanted to run it on a square footage basis that would get you to occupancy of 98.6%. The third way you could do it is take the previous rents on any vacant properties and divide that by the sum of that number and the rent on the occupied properties and using that methodology occupancy is 98.8% and obviously any of the three indicated higher occupancy. Same store rents on the core portfolio increased 1.5% during the first quarter. As you recall during last year’s same-store rent was a small negative in the first three quarters and barely positive for the year. So getting to 1.5% is a good rate I think for a net lease portfolio and it’s good to get back to that number. Diversification really continued to widen substantially in the quarter. As I mentioned before 3,525 properties. That’s up 512 properties from last quarter in 46 different industries now with 195 different tenants in 49 states and Puerto Rico. And then the industry exposures also continue to climb substantially. Our largest industry today convenience stores is at 12%. That’s down 290 basis points from last quarter and up 500 basis points from a year ago. Restaurants as you know is an area that we had targeted to reduce. If you combine both the casual dining and quick service is now down to 10.5% and that’s down 190 basis points from last quarter and 410 basis points over the same period a year ago. I’ll just note we once I think had 22% of our revenue in that sector. Theatres are at 6.7. That’s down 200 basis points quarter and 300 for year. And then you get to health and fitness and drug stores, both about 6%. Health and fitness down a bit and then the three industries really that have been moving up, drug stores is at 6% now, up 270 basis points from last quarter. The dollar stores is up to about 5.6% and then transportation services at 5.2%, when you get below that, any other category is below 4% and a very good shape keeping industry concentrations reasonable. Same thing on the tenant standpoint. Our largest at 5.7% is FedEx, that’s up over the last year because of some acquisitions we made and the ARCT portfolio. L.A. Fitness is second at 4.5%, that’s down 60 basis points from the last quarter. And then everything else is now down below 3.5% exposure in the portfolio. And as I mentioned, the largest top 15 are down 42.6%. And when you get to the 15s, you will notice you are about 1.5% of revenue, so that this continues to widen on our tenant and also on an industry standpoint and certainly the same could be said from a geographic standpoint. [Average leasing] due to acquisitions has remained very healthy at 11.1 year and as I mentioned, the portfolio continues to generate very stable income with high occupancy. Relative to property dispositions, we accelerated the asset disposition program a bit during the quarter with a focus on the intent of trying to further strengthen the credit quality of the overall portfolio, and doing that by reducing exposures in certain industries and properties that we think might be particularly sensitive to any economic weakness or a tenant whose balance sheet is levered, and if interest rates were to go up, we think that they might be somewhat at risk. During the quarter we sold 17 properties for $60 million. As you recall, we were looking in our guidance for a little over $100 million in dispositions for the year, and so getting $60 million of that done in the first quarter is very positive. And we think that going forward that we will easily hit that 100. I think we said 75 million to 100 million, we believe we hit that and I would say well over 100 for the year at this point. Most of the sales for the quarter were in the restaurant and (inaudible) industry relative to number of properties. We also sold a multitenant investor property that we had had in the portfolio for about 25 years that had 375 tenants that we think exposure to economic weakness might be substantially more than the balance of our portfolio, and so we moved that out with a sale. I think it's safe to say the amount of sales just like acquisitions will vary quarter-to-quarter and be a bit lumpy, but they could accelerate a bit more as the year goes on. Let me move on to property acquisitions. As I have talked about for some time, acquisitions will vary quarter-to-quarter and they are a challenge to predict for any individual quarter. But given really excellent transaction flow that we are seeing right now and what we did in the first quarter, which is a little more than we generally do, we are off to a very good start for the year. The first quarter as I mentioned, is a little slow. If you recall, last year I think we did $1.2 billion and I think we did $10 million in the first quarter. So at $128 million, we view that as a positive. I also think that transaction volume at that this point tells us, this should be another very good year for acquisitions. We initially had in the guidance, $550 million. I can say now, and we are sitting in fairly early April but that should not be an issue for us. And we should be able to meet that and exceed that which is very much a positive at this time of the year. Let me have John Case, our President and Chief Investment Officer make some comments about what we did and kind of what we are seeing out there in the marketplace. John?
John Case: As Tom said, we remain active on the acquisitions front. During the first quarter we made $128 million in property level investments in 27 properties at an average yield of 7.9%. These properties had a weighted average lease term of just under 14 years and 22% of these assets are leased to investment grade tenants. The properties are leased to 14 different tenants and 11 different industries, so well diversified. Two of the tenants are new to our portfolio and the most significant industries represented were transportation services and [health] business. Properties are located in 16 states and about 80% of the investments are comprised of our traditional retail properties. Of course this activity was in addition to our $3.2 billion acquisition of American realty capital trust which added 515 properties and closed in January. So our combined total investment in real estate for the first quarter was just under $3.3 billion and 542 properties. This was clearly our most active quarter in our company's history by a significant margin. Let me spend a moment here and talk about the market environment today. I’ll start with transaction flow. Tom just alluded to that. We continue to be very busy. So far in the first quarter we sourced $4.3 billion in acquisition opportunities. So transaction flow continues to remain strong. We continue to work on a number of these opportunities and we’re expecting another active year for transaction flow. While investment opportunities are fairly abundant, competition for these acquisitions is also abundant. There are plenty of well capitalized buyers in the market today led by private and public lease REITS, but we’re also seeing some other private institutional buyers seeking yield in our space. These buyers are using more leverage with the CMBS market in our space that has gained strength here in the past quarter or two. And that’s helping our private buyers better compete. But we expect to continue to close on a fair share of these opportunities. As far as pricing goes, cap rates remain low relative to historical standards. Given the strong bid in the market today they’re coming under a bit more pressure. Non-investment grade properties are trading in the 7% to 8% cap rate range. Investment grade assets are trading in the 6% to 7% cap rate range. However, our overall cost of capital has also continued to decline. So our investment spreads remain very healthy relative to our historical averages. The current market portfolios in the $50 to $250 million range continue to trade at premium pricing relative to single assets. So buyers are willing to pay a portfolio premium in order to deploy larger amounts of capital efficiently. This is the trend we’ve been seeing for the last year or so and we expect to see it continuing. So to recap our outlook, we do remain optimistic about achieving our previous acquisitions guidance of $550 million for this year. We are still modeling a 7.25% initial yield on acquisitions for 2013. But that number will depend on our ultimate mix of investment grade and non-investment grade acquisitions. In the first quarter, our property level acquisitions yielded 7.9%, it's really reflective of investment grade assets accounting for 22% of the total volume. We would expect our near-term quarterly average cap rates to be a bit closer to the 7.25% rates we have communicated to the market.
Thomas Lewis: Thanks, John. John likes to use the term to get our fair share. I would prefer us giving our disproportionate fair share. Either way, we are pleased with the start here for the year and very pleased where spreads are in the marketplace. It's a very good time due to acquire. Obviously, the recent acquisitions have certainly contributed to our revenue earnings and dividend growth, and that is very visible in the numbers here in the first quarter. But the other thing we are doing, they also and equally important to have, continued to help us adjust the makeup of our portfolio where we are focused on moving the portfolio up the credit curve and obviously we have made very good progress on that throughout this quarter, with investment grade tenants now making up around 35% of the portfolio. As I talked to it bit about last quarter, over the last 36 months or so, we have now acquired about $6.2 billion of property including RT. About $3.7 billion of that is in retail and really pointed towards sectors that we think should continue to do well in what we anticipate is a somewhat more sluggish retail environment over the next 15-20 years than it had been in the past. And so we are really happy to get that invested and focused in the areas we want. About $2.5 billion of what we acquired are in areas outside of retail that we think will do well for us, all with investment grade tenants. And of that total $6.2 billion, about $3.9 billion or 63% of what we acquired over the last 36 months have been with investment grade tenants. And what's interesting is a good measure of the rest of the tenants and acquisitions while not investment grade, are also further up the credit curve than the average in the portfolio just a few years ago and we are pleased with that. It's kind of interesting to watch that move and I will share some statistics with you. If we go back and really look at having set out and thought that we should do this from 2008 and really started executing it in 2010. If you look in 2008, our top 15 tenants did 54.3% of our revenue. Their average [DAR] score, and the [DAR] score is our credit score, that approximated credit score similar to what the rating agencies would do. So the average [DAR] score on our scale is about 6.92, which would equate to a single B plus or Double B minus credit rating. And also none of the top 15 tenants had investment grade ratings. Having undertaken this project starting three years ago, today the top 15 are down to 42.6% of our revenue. The average [DAR] credit score is up to 11.67. That approximates to approximately to a triple B minus credit rating for the tenants and six of the top 15 carry investment grade rating. So, really most of the work has been done in the last three years. But looking out, it was 2008 we have gone from 54.3% of revenue to 42.6%. The DAR score is 6.92 to 11.67 and we are now up to where six of our top 15 tenants are investment grade. And that’s over really just about four years of activity. And we anticipate that trend will continue in that what we are trying to accomplish. I think the other thing about, that’s important to us is, how we paid for the acquisitions over the last three years. We did issue about $1.2 billion investment grade notes, most long-term at very good rates. As Paul mentioned, we have assumed some mortgages in the portfolio as we have taken over that we intend to pay off as quickly as we can. And we have done in that period about $162 million of property sales. More important to us is issuing a little over $400 million in perpetual preferred. And then we have issued equity in the last three years or so, six times and generated about $3.7 billion in gross proceeds. So about $6.24 billion in capital overall, of which $4 billion was common and/or preferred. And as we all live here in this very low interest rate environment, I think we want to remember that these rates there’s a possibility they won’t persist for ever and be mindful of where they could go, what funding costs could be and what has to be rolled over. So getting a lot of preferred in the equity done has been very positive and we intend to keep the balance sheet in really good shape that may even modestly delever from here on a bit to keep us in really good position. Relative to capital, we’re in very good shape. As Paul mentioned, there’s plenty of dry powder to execute on the acquisitions as they present themselves. Raising a net $755 million in equity a few weeks ago was very helpful to make sure the $1 billion credit line with the $500 million [quoting] was available. And so now we’re in very good shape there. Capital obviously is extremely attractively priced and spreads are very wide. So I really think that we’re in great shape. I would note that we’re particularly pleased watching how the equity has performed here in recent weeks. If you think about it, we’ve put about $2.8 billion of equity into the market in the last 90 days between our T and the offering. And so for the equity to perform this way I think it’s fair to say the market seems to have absorbed it fairly well and we have good access. Earnings as Paul mentioned, normalized FFO at $0.61, up 32%. That’s a percentage number we haven’t seen before. Same thing with FFO at $0.60, up 20%. Relative to the guidance, we are staying with our previous guidance for now. We think April at this point we feel very good about all facets of the operations and very comfortable with the primary drivers to achieving the guidance which is as John mentioned $550 million in acquisitions and we think it will easily hit that and likely exceed it. But for now we’ll stay where we are and revisit the numbers over the next quarter. So things on hold. That puts normalized FFO for the year at $2.32 to $2.38 which is around 15% to 28% growth and AFFO at $2.33 to $2.39 which is 13% to 16% growth. I’ll finish with dividends. We remain optimistic that we’ll be able to continue to increase the dividend. Obviously had nice movement in that in the first quarter as Paul mentioned and we look forward to have additional increases over the year. And with that, Tager, if you’ll come back and help us with questions we’d appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Please come ahead, sir.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: John, if we can go back to your previous comment of I guess acquisitions [since] you’re hanging that, let’s call it 7.25% range. What was the driver of such a higher cap rate in the first quarter?
John Case: Yeah. It was primarily the percentage of non-investment grade assets we closed. We closed 22% in investment grade which was a bit lower than we had been closing in the previous quarters and certainly 64% in investment grade investments we did in 2012. So that’s the main driver, Manny.
Thomas Lewis: Yeah. There was one transaction we did in the first quarter with a tenant we like a great deal and it had a very attractive yield for what is a non-rated company. But if they were rated it would certainly be considered investment grade. So we were able to secure a good deal there and it just happened to be where what came in this quarter versus what may come in next quarter.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: And then maybe Tom you could tell us a little bit more about how competition has been split between the investment grade product and maybe the stuff that looks less perfect on paper but at the end of the day is all good property.
Thomas Lewis: You mean the transaction flow that’s come in the door?
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: And maybe just the competitors that are looking at those types of assets.
John Case: I’ll take that Manny. We’re seeing a fairly broad group of competitors on both sides. I would say there are a bit more on the traditional retail product on the institutional larger buyers than there are on the non-retail product. And on the investment grade side, there’s good competition out there, but primarily from the higher quality companies with lower capital cost that can pursue this type of product. So it's probably not quite as extensive as on the non-investment grade. Is that what you were looking for?
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: Yeah, perfect.
John Case: And there is plenty of people looking to buy properties in both sectors, Manny.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: And maybe just to dig in a little bit deeper on what you were saying earlier, Tom, that it sounds like you have kind of stuck to you guns in the retail space, though I guess [RT] was the biggest mix of retail and non-retail. What can we expect for the rest of the year? Are you guys kind of literally going to look at things just on what comes through or is there a goal to diversify more out of retail?
Thomas Lewis: You know it's, we are willing to do either, what we are really focused on is taking a look at the retailers and the consumer they serve. And it's discretionary goods and services or what they sell and there target markets better be the upper middle income or the upper income, because it it's lower middle or lower, we don’t want to buy it. So focus there. And then on the non-discretionary type goods and services, if that’s what the retailer is selling then we are pretty good at the upper and middle income, but if it's lower we want to make sure that there is very deep value proposition and that’s why we have gotten into the Club Stores and Dollar Stores and others. And that is a big focus when we are in retail. And then generically moving up the credit curve, and in retail there are investment grade credits but there is a limited number. And so to get the portfolio up to credit curve, we are more than willing to look outside of retail. But it really has to be the Fortune 500, maybe Fortune 1000 and investment grade and what we think is property that they would consider it very very important to their business. So whether it comes in an either basket, we don’t really mind. And we are happy to have both sides expand a little more so if retail went up a little bit, it wouldn’t bother us as long as it was hit right where we wanted to go and generally up the curve. But we would be happy if retail, which I think in the quarter was around 79, if that falls to 75 or 4, or 3 or 2, that’s fine too. But I don’t have a numerical target on either one of those. It's really just those boxed we are trying to hit in terms of what we want to acquire and what we want to stay away from.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Joshua Barber with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus: Quick one, can you tell us what the disposition cap rate was on your assets during the quarter?
John Case: That is a great question and let me see if I have that sitting here in front of me, which I may or may not have. Well, for the year, Manny, our estimate for call it a 100 million plus, it's going to be 8.75%, if that’s okay.
Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus: Do you know what it was in the quarter?
Thomas Lewis: Disposition cap. No, we have got it here, I am sorry. It was a little, actually lower than what we were planning for the year. I do know that because the one larger multi-tenant sale was substantially lower than that. Do you remember the cap rate on the transaction? Yeah, it was like a 7.5, and that was a big piece of it. So I would guess it is probably is closer to the 7-7.5 range but we will try to....
Paul Meurer: I think we will do better than the 7.5, we tend to model that conservatively depending on what we chose to sell later in the year.
Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Maybe there is a broader question, but you guys have been very clear over the last few that you are trying to minimize the retail and get more investment grade, get slightly different property types. Is that a trend that you expect to [give in] or do you think that there will be some other move that you would like to make to really reshape the portfolio over the next couple of years?
Thomas Lewis: Yeah, I do think we will continue doing what we are doing. And as I said in the last question, we were happy to be in retail and we haven’t moved away from it and we are happy to buy. We are just going to be more particular in terms of who the tenants are, who they serve and what their balance sheet looks like. And so if we think they are investment grade or close so there is not a big refinance risk when interest rates go up, we are happy to do it. And as long as we are staying away from consumer discretionary to just kind of lower income is who they market to, then we are happy to do it. And we would be just (inaudible) retail space right where it is. However, we are also focused on generically moving up the curve. And so if it's out to do that, we are happy to do it. We don’t have a target. It's right now 78 or 79, 21-22 is the mix, and over the course of the year if I had to guess, we will probably see a little more outside of retail, but we’re probably in the year where retail is still over 70% of the portfolio.
Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus: Last question. When you’re looking at some larger scale acquisitions, given that you have significantly [priced] your enterprise value than you have in the past, do you think you have a little bit more room today to take on secure debt from another company, from another portfolio? Would you have a little bit more ability to do that or would that be something that you just don’t want to risk the balance sheet on?
Thomas Lewis: We have done that. We’ve got over $700 million of secured debt naturally come from buying portfolio. So we’re willing to do it. But when we do it we try and pay off anything we can that doesn’t have significant prepayment penalties and is an economic payoff. And then we will even place if there’s one, two, three, four year debt and see and pay that off as soon as we can. So it is our preference not to have any secured debt, but given size to buy portfolios I think that that will be the case from time to time. But it’s going to remain a very small part of our balance sheet. And it is something we could consider, but as soon as we get it on the books the purpose is get it off.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Robert W. Baird. Please come ahead, sir.
Tom Lesnick - Robert W. Baird & Co.: I’m just standing in for Paula. I just wanted to follow up on an earlier question about the competition. I know you guys talked about competition across the credit spectrum already, but are you seeing increased competition in certain industries relative to other industries that you’re looking at acquiring?
John Case: Not really. There’s pretty strong competition across the board and we’re not really seeing it vary by the industry of the tenant.
Thomas Lewis: Yeah. There’s enough people that are broad in terms of what they’ll look at, whether it’s investment grade or non-investment grade, but I don’t think there are any sectors that are just standing there with gaping holes with nobody investing in them. And we look through all the industries we’re in. we buy convenience stores. Other people do. We buy theatres. Other people do and you can go right across it. We’re not buying casual dining, sit down dinner house restaurants, but other people are. So the fact we’re out of that doesn’t mean I think there’s a gaping hole. It’s competitive throughout. The performance of the net lease companies obviously has been relatively good for most of just the last few years and with the demand for yields, both institutionally and retail, given the yield characteristics in that lease it’s pretty much across the board everywhere. We’re fortunate that we have done this a long time. We have the experience and size and so the deal flow has been equally good. But it’s competitive all the way across.
Tom Lesnick - Robert W. Baird & Co.: And then secondly, I just wanted to hone in again on the disposition guidance. I know you mentioned $100 million plus. In your comments you said well over $100 million potentially and it could accelerate through the year. Could you ballpark that as maybe $100 to $150 or $100 to $200? How much of a disposition pipeline or backlog do you guys have that you’re trying to get through?
Thomas Lewis: That’s a good question and let me take a little time here and give some clarity how we look at it. First the number of saying 75 to 100 and that’s up from 50, it was up from 25 or so the year before. So I now would be surprised if we didn’t hit over 100, but I don’t have this backlog of stuff that I really feel I need to get out because I’m very much worried about it. The objective is just generally sell if it will increase the cash flow, if it materially increases credit quality or if it reduces concentration. Bu the primary area is where we’ve gone through the portfolio really parsed it and seen where we see risks. And that’s what we’re trying to sell and we originally targeted, if you recall I spent some time on a previous call and maybe it’s a good time to talk a little bit of that now, focusing around what we’re trying to do and changing the portfolio. I think you know that will do it quick and then related to because of that we look at dispositions. As I mentioned, we’re trying to go up the credit curve and really trying to hit retailers that hit the consumers in certain way and stay away from the rest of them. That’s just a function of how we see the economy going forward and interest rates. A few years ago, what we did is we sat down and reenter the whole portfolio and it was 67 tenants that do 83% of revenue. And we rerated all the industries based on our views and then the consumer they serve. And then there were 24 different metrics which were a lot of debt, fixed charge coverage and margin and the big part of it though was saying if they had to refinance the whole balance sheet and permanent financing costs were 300 basis points higher, what it would look like, and then 600 basis points higher. And then we model the perfect storm which is revenues down, margins tightened and then interest rates up by 600 basis points. And when we finished, we really dropped everything in the four categories. And we had a kind of green color code which is strong buy, that was 23% of our revenues were generated by tenants who did that. Yellow, which was buy, was 21% of revenue. Red, which was hold, was 16% of revenue. And then kind of black, and this is for retailers who are in 23% of the revenue, and that’s kind of sell. And so we looked at that and said, okay, we want to materially change the composition of the portfolio. And starting three years ago, the easiest way to do that is acquisitions. And when you do it with acquisitions, there is a side benefit and that is, it increases your earnings and your dividends materially. So that really was the focus. And so we drove in and said, as I talked about a couple of times now, consumer non-discretionary, the value propositions. Consumer discretionary, making sure it's low price point in ticket and going up the credit curve and outside of retail. And the result, we bought the $6.2 billion, it's a 120 different tenants, 41 industries. 60% of it was retail, 40% wasn’t. But 63% of everything we bought in the last three years was investment grade. And so that took investment grade from zero to about 35% and it really changed the portfolio. The property sales program is the other way to do it. And if you take what was 23% of revenues that comes from retailers that are rated black or sell, that’s the first step. But the second step is then, we don’t own their bonds and stock, we own their property. So we need to look at the individual properties we own and we want to look at their profitability to see how big the margin of safety is. And that might cause us to want to keep the property even though we are not particularly enamored with that particular retail and the area they are in. And then we want to look at if the rent on the property is above or below market. And if it's above, see where the risk is and if it's below, if there is an opportunity to capture rent if it came off lease. And then we will want to probably keep the rest, even though the retailer might be rated down in that area. So initially, we came up with a list of 190 million of property sales that we wanted to make that we thought would make a material dent in reducing the risk of our existing portfolio coupled with a pretty large acquisition pipeline. Today we have sold 162 million of that 190. So I do have a list there. And then we will move further into kind of black or so rated tenant but with some better properties. And at that point we may just move into the red a little bit. So there I don’t have this pressing, pressing need. And if you combined the sales and the acquisitions -- you want to grab a pen, these might be interesting numbers. In 2011 when we reentered the portfolio, it was 67 tenants that did 83% of our revenue. And I mentioned a minute ago, 22.8% were in the green strong buy. 21.4% were in the yellow buy. 15.9% were in the red hold. And then we have 22.9% of our revenue came from people at black, sell. Now roll forward to be in the first quarter, and it's now 118 tenants that make up 87.2% of our revenue that are in these numbers. And we now have, in the strong buy green category, 58 tenants that now do 42.7% of our revenue. So we are from, in that category, up from 22.8% of revenue to 42.7%. In the yellow we have got 21 tenants that are 21.9% of revenue. So that’s up a bit. In the red or hold, we have moved to 25 tenants that are only 9.8% of revenues. So we have gone from 59% to 9.8% there. And then in the black that was 22.9% of the portfolio, is down to 12.8%, and its only 14 tenants. And I think of one individual tenant that’s chunky in that 12.8%. And in that one we went through and did an analysis at property level and found that we had properties where the rents were above market and the cash flow coverages were okay and we have sold those. We had some where the rent were about at market and the cash flow coverage were just okay and we have sold those. But in that particular tenant there was just a lot of property where the cash flow coverage was modest but the rent substantially below market. We actually think there is a recapture there, so we won't sell those. But that’s kind of it. I mean we can make more progress on this in the acquisition side and we also increase earnings and dividends and we have done a lot of what we were really worried about on the sales. So I am going to plug it at $100 to $125 million and then if over the course of the year we decide to do a little more we’ll communicate that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, sir.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities: The same-store growth you highlighted was 1.5% in the quarter. It’s historically only been about 1%, maybe a little bit better than that. Is this a rate we should expect the rest of the year and what do you contribute this a little bit above the average growth to?
Thomas Lewis: It’s funny. I think it was a little above average and if you want a run rate I think 1% is a good one to use. Interestingly enough if you go back a few years ago in the recession you’ll recall we had a few tenants out of our very large group of tenants that went through some chapter 11s and one of the things we did when we set some rents lower for them, we were also to build in some recapture if their business rebounded and their business has now rebounded and so strangely enough a good part of that comes from the restaurant industry and it comes from tenants that there was a problem and their rent accelerated over the last few months as their business was better and our leases had been changed to capture part of that. But we think going forward and particularly with the RT coming into the numbers over time, I think 1% is a good run rate.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities: And then you guided for 7.25% for 2013 acquisitions. And the average lease term was up around 14 years in the quarter. What’s the fair lease term average for the remainder of the year? You think it will be that long or closer to the in-place average of about 11?
John Case: I think it could range from 11 up to 15, 16, right in there. It’s hard to tell at this point. But they are all pretty much initial terms above 10. You see some 20. You see a fair amount of 15. It just depends on how much you end up doing at each lease side.
Thomas Lewis: And then it could be impacted if one of the larger transactions come through and that can change the cap rate up or down depending on who the tenant is. Those numbers John gave you are the ones that we’re using for modeling.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities: And just to stay on that theme, if a good portfolio of assets was presented to you with an investment grade tenant roster, would you deemed an attractive price, what would be the shortest average lease time you would consider?
Thomas Lewis: Interesting. I would never say never and I think that’s smart to do. But when you get inside of 10 years it starts growing some concern from us and you would have to be able to get in and establish that the rents were at or substantially below market before you want to go much inside 10 years I think. And that’s in a chunky one or two tenant acquisitions something that could be done, but in a broad M&A type situation it becomes a bit more challenging. So on any granular acquisition 10 years is where we just draw the line and if it was an M&A situation we’d like to think 10 years subject to review of where rents are verse market.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities: That’s helpful Tom. And Paul, I assume you used a line to meet your March debt maturity?
Paul Meurer: That’s correct.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities: Is that factored into guidance and how long would you assume if that would sit there and how long is that factored in and I guess how much is factored in the guidance?
Paul Meurer: Well, that was factored in the guidance. We just planned since it was only $100 million to do it on the line and then let the line balance run up a bit before we would consider a more permanent financing activity in concert with the acquisition deal flow run rate and what happens there. So we sit here today in very good shape in terms of what that line balance is and no imminent capital needs. But that would really at this point be dependent upon the acquisition deal flow and when that stuff closes.
Thomas Lewis: We also when we were looking at whatever financing we do next and plugging in what it would cost us, tried to use a rate substantially higher than where debt is sitting today and then that gives us the option of doing equity preferred without materially moving the model. And if we decided to do debt it would have an impact.
Paul Meurer: Yes. We basically modeled it where we could do anything if you will at that time, equity preferred or debt.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of [Daniel Dowling with Landenberg Dowling]. Please go ahead, sir.
Unidentified Analyst: Just real quick on the 7.9% acquisition cap rate. Is that (inaudible) cash?
Paul Meurer: Yeah.
Unidentified Analyst: So on a GAAP basis, what would that be?
Thomas Lewis: More.
Paul Meurer: It would be probably 8.10%, in that area.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then what is the interest rate -- what is the average interest rate on the 700 million that you guys (inaudible) that ARCT?
John Case: That’s part ARCT and parts other we have taken.
Unidentified Analyst: Right. So the total portfolio of mortgage is 729 million then?
John Case: Yeah. As a weighted average and straight right now of 5.4%.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. All right. And then as we look at kind of the rent increases or decreases, I guess you could say, on the subsequent expirations versus your initial lease expirations. Who should we look at that, would you expect to see higher rent growth on the initial expirations and then less on the subsequent or does it...?
John Case: We do better on the subsequent then we do on the initial. And traditionally, the subsequent has done very well and is up and the initial is down. Roll overs, this year so far and the ones we have done are up about 3.3%. Modeling for the year will kind of just assuming that they will be pretty much flat. Traditionally, and this gets back very historical, we had rolled down. And the roll down, I think back in 2002, was about 24% in that peak. And one of the things that we did, started seeing in the mid-90s, is that roll down at the end of the lease was really starting to hit us, and this is in the mind-90s. And we dramatically changed how we acquire. Previous to that, everything we acquired was a new store, and we didn’t have cash flow coverages, and they were all less than investment grade. And we found they did pretty well throughout the lease, but at the end of the lease if we bought a bunch of new stores, about a third of them were below average, a third average and a third above. So we totally changed our underwriting in retail to pre-select those with high cash flow coverage and profits. So we would not preselect the one-third that were underperformers. So over the years what's happened is the burn that we get in lease rollover keeps declining pretty substantially. And yet the portfolio that’s rolling over is stuff that was bought still quite a bit ago, particularly the subsequent. So the last year there was a roll down of about 4%. And so far this year it's up 3% and we are thinking it will be closer to zero. And I think that’s a good way to think of it.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just two quick housekeeping items. What is the amortization of net mortgage premiums that you guys recognize in the AFFO line? What's the run rate there, (inaudible)?
Paul Meurer: Yeah, obviously, that’s associated with any portion of the mortgages that we assume that are above market. And the projections for the year is about $9.2 million. You see the quarterly amount, just trying to grab the AFFO page, indicated in here, just under $2 million that occurred in the quarter. But the projections for the year, right now based on the mortgages that we currently own is about $9.2 million. And that is an amount that we reduced from AFFO, in order to arrive a real bottom line cash flow amount for us.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And the capitalized interest in the quarter?
Paul Meurer: That’s a pretty small number. I don’t really have that handy. You don’t mean capital expenditures?
Unidentified Analyst: No, no, just capitalized interest. I was just curious if you guys are doing any, funding up developments and what not. I know you have done that back in the past, so.
Thomas Lewis: We are, and I don’t know, John, if you have the number handy, but we definitely have some development commitments underway. But it's a pretty small amount. And total for the currently...
John Case: Let me give those numbers, Tom.
Paul Meurer: Yeah, in the first quarter of our activity, 11 million of that was in development funding and funding of expansions on existing assets. And we have $21 million in development funding or banking. So it's a pretty small number relative to our overall size. But I don’t have the capitalized interest associated with that.
Thomas Lewis: And (inaudible) those numbers and is not looking for capitalized interest but thinking about development risk. All of those are on existing properties where a lease has been placed so there is no lease-up risk on that. It's just expansions or we bought the land and we are funding the development, but we have the lease in place from the tenant already.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik with Morningstar. Please go ahead, sir.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Just a quick one on property site distribution. I know that healthcare is now on the roster. It’s just under 2% of revenues. I just wonder if you could explain a bit more about what that is and then in general if you could talk about your attitude toward triple that lease healthcare and whether or not you expect that to be an area that grows in the portfolio.
Thomas Lewis: Most of that came from the RT acquisitions. The tenants there are DaVita which most people know is one of the largest in the dialysis area an also Fresenius. There’s also a few express scripts properties, actually a few leased to GE Healthcare and then like four MOBs I believe they are that are at the Saint Joseph’s. So it’s fairly limited. It is not an area we’re targeting. If it grows it would surprise me as of now. I guess it could a little bit. But those are mostly that came out of that area and I don’t think I have a formal attitude towards it outside that it’s an area and an industry that is very well financed by some very smart folks. And if we find something at the margin time but it’s not anything we’re pointing to.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: And then just wanted to see if you could update us on rent escalators related to inflation across your portfolio. I know a few years back you guys were trying to get more of those written into your leases. I was wondering if you could tell us what percentage the portfolio now has escalators specifically related to something like CPI and whether or not you have better success today than you did in the past on new sale lease back transactions, getting something like that written into the initial leases.
Thomas Lewis: Today the number is 15.61% of like real inflation percentage sale, that type of stuff going into it. And that’s up substantially from a few years ago and I would give us a C to D grade at best in getting that done. It is extraordinarily difficult. It is not the norm in the industry and is really an out wire and is probably one of the more frustrating things in the management of the business and something that we really continue to work on. And as we drop back into a strategic planning mode which we’re going to do this year, that is something that we’re really going to think about where we could go to try and accomplish that. But today in the net lease business it’s C&O. it’s the fountain of youth that comes daily on but nobody ever finds. And I really think that’s the case and you have to really parse how you ask the question because if you say do you have CPI accelerators in your leases? Well yeah. It would be a massive number for us, but they’re capped. So what they really are is fixed increases. So, it really does need to be asked, but it’s unrestricted and that’s about 15.6% for us and very unusual to get.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: And then just last question with regards to the assets for divestiture. I know you had an industrial property in there I guess you said this quarter. Going forward, is it reasonable to assume that those are pretty much going to be all retail or are there any other property sectors that you guys have invested in more recently that have properties that are falling into that bucket for divestiture?
Thomas Lewis: I think the bucket is going to be retail and I think it’s going to be the ones that have fallen down in that category. And tenants that are very levered and it will probably be dominated by restaurants and there may be some convenience stores and then a smattering of other things.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Right now about a third of your portfolio is investment grade and that’s obviously up substantially over the last couple of years. As we listen to the call, Tom, I’m wondering, the ultimate goal clearly is 100% investment grade even though you keep moving up the investment grade curve and during the quarter you had below one third investment grade tenants come up. And I’m wondering, has big move in investment grade change to the portfolio occurred and 35% is about right for the total? Or is there much more to go from this point?
Thomas Lewis: I hope it hasn’t occurred and I hope there is much more to go because I’d like that number to be substantially higher. But I want to modify it in that it’s not just buying investment to buy investment grade. The reason we want to do it, is over the last 30 years the tenures quite frankly have just gone from 15% to 1.7% when I looked at it this morning. And that has made a lot of very levered business strategies that involve a lot of financial engineering work. And should interest rates go up, which were really low, I want to focus on companies that would really have trouble refinancing their balance sheet. Now that means generally investment grade companies are going to be less impacted. There are tenants who are not investment grade. Who don’t have a lot of debt but they are not investment or a even a [shallow] rating might be less than investment grade because of their size. But if they are size and they don’t have big refinance risk exposure and the customer they serve doesn’t, then still interests us very much. Even though they are not investment grade because we are really for that lack of risk relative to refinance. However, the bigger the entity, the lower the default rate. The rating agencies will tell you, all your research tells us that. But I don’t want to say always, but I would like it to continue to increase. But we are happy to have some of the tenants not being investment grade. But even those that aren’t, I will tell you, have moved up the curve where they are closer to investment grade substantially then they were a number of years ago. Much less of the highly levered private equity M&A type of stuff.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Good. I got you. That makes sense. Then on the disposition just for a moment. How much of the portfolio is double net, non-triple net, maybe multi-tenants which I assume aren’t as attractive, that fall in not so much into a tenant category but fall into a tight category that you would want to divest. Is that part of the strategy as well?
Thomas Lewis: Yeah, I mean you know the industrial property that we sold during the quarter was like 400,00 square feet with 375 small tenants. And so you start looking at a weak economic environment, you would worry there. But we are kind of pretty much done with that. We have sold most of what we had there. The double net that we might have is actually more up the credit curve with people and it's just that it’s 2.5 net where you may have some responsibility with it. But those aren’t things that we are really looking to get out of. We are looking at those when we underwrite them relative to the cap rate we get and try and amortize some type of expense ratio for them, even if the expenses are lumpy.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Obviously, so you didn’t get multitenant from RT that you are trying to get rid off?
Thomas Lewis: No. No, that portfolio was almost all pretty straight net lease. You know if we get a bunch of grocery anchor centers, we will think about (inaudible).
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Yeah, I got you. Okay. And then on the G&A front, it sounds like you are just annualizing this quarter pretty much for the year, which means that you have done the hiring and the additional infrastructure that you need to support things like RT. Is that true? So you are pretty much done with that sort of aspect of business?
John Case: Well, yeah. That’s part of the answer, and then the other part is we did have some G&A reduction because some of the employees who were associated with the large multi-tenant asset we sold, effects that employee count if you will. So that kind of offset the number a little bit but got ahead in the last one (inaudible).
Thomas Lewis: Yeah. And I will tell you one of the reasons I don’t want to move the guidance right now, we feel very comfortable where it is, is I think it could get better but I also think we may do some more G&A this year. We are kind of doing a project in house from looking at, if the company was twice as large, what it would need to look like, how would reporting look, what would people be doing. And then we have identified a number of areas where we want to add staff and expertise. And there's probably a number of people and acquisitions where we are going to do that. A number of people in research, we want to do that. There has been some movement internally, so we need to do that portfolio management. And we will have a, I think a pretty good increase in employee count during the course of this year. We just kind of earned the midst of our recruiting and the undergrad out there and we will probably do a much bigger class this year then we have done in the past. So we have grown substantially and I think we need to add a few people for that even though this addition to the RT is very efficient, but we also want to plan for growth. And so we are going to need, I think a couple of more executives around here and a good group of professionals added in. So there will be more.
Paul Meurer: And most of that won't affect the 2013 estimate too much, Rich. But it will certainly increase the annualized run rate as we add in people over the course of the year on a go forward basis.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, I got you. So that’s all in the $45 million. So it sounds good. The last thing, Paul, the other income line items was, I think, substantially higher. What was that exactly?
Paul Meurer: That’s always a mixed bag of interest income on cash if we do a capital raise and the cash sits around for a few days or a week if you will. Interest income in that sense also evenness in takings which are a normal part of the portfolio manager process. So if you have a situation where there’s an eminent domain or a portion of your parking lot, sometimes it doesn’t mean it affects the viability of the asset itself. It actually ends up being pretty positive proceeds that we receive in this situation. So that’s all that 1.4 is is a mixed bag of those items if you will. Nothing different about the normal business.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets: So that goes back down I assume most likely in 2Q?
Paul Meurer: Correct. I don’t think 1.4 million is an appropriate run rate. No.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer portion of the Realty Income conference call. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Lewis for concluding remarks. Please go ahead, sir.
Thomas Lewis: Thank you everybody for joining us for this. I know it’s a busy season, particularly a busy day and we appreciate the attention look forward to talking to you at one of the upcoming events. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q4  (2013-02-14 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Thomas Lewis - Vice Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer Paul Meurer - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Treasurer John Case - Executive Vice President, Chief Investment Officer
Analysts: Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is also being recorded today, Thursday, February 14, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Lewis, Chief Executive Officer of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.
Thomas Lewis: Thank you, Katya and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our conference call and as Katya mentioned, we will go over the fourth quarter and our results for 2012 and a bit about what's happened since year-end. In the room with me today, is Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Case, our Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer and Tere Miller, our Vice President of Corporate Communications. As I am obligated to do, I will say that during this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law and the company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in the forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail on the company's Form 10-K the factors that may cause such differences. As is our custom, Paul, perhaps you can begin with overview of the numbers.
Paul Meurer: Thank you, Tom. So, as usual, I will walk through our financial statements briefly and provide some highlights of our financial results for the quarter and where appropriate for the year as a whole, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 16% for the quarter and for the year. Our revenue for the quarter was approximately $130 million or about $520 million annualized run rate at year-end. This increase reflects positive same-store rent but more significantly it reflects our growth from new acquisitions over the past year. Pro forma, for the ARCT acquisition completed in January, our current annualized total revenues as of 12/31 are now $712 million. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by about $8.6 million in the comparative quarterly period, as depreciation expense obviously has increased as our property portfolio continues to grow. Interest expense increased in the quarter by about $6.1 million and this was due to the $800 million of bonds that were issued in October, as well as some credit facility borrowings during the quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong with interest coverage at 3.6 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.7 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the fourth quarter were approximately $10 million and $38 million for the year. Our G&A expense increased this past year as our acquisition activity increased, also because we added new personnel and our proxy process last spring was more expensive than usual. We ended up expensing $2.4 million of acquisition due diligence costs during the year. Our employee base grew from 83 employees a year ago to 97 employees today. However, our total G&A was the still less than 8% of our total revenues. Property expenses were just under $1.7 million for the quarter and $7.3 million for the year. These expenses historically have been primarily our carry cost associated with properties available for lease. However, our 2013 property expense estimate is higher at about $12.5 million as we have recently purchased more double net properties double net properties whereby we are responsible for some of the property maintenance cost. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company. They were only $215,000 for the quarter and $1.4 million for the year. ARCT merger-related costs, obviously this line items refers to the cost associated with the ARCT acquisition. During the fourth quarter we expensed approximately $2.4 million of such costs, and for all of 2012, we expensed just under $7.9 million. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $3.6 million. This income is associated with our property sales activity. We sold 14 properties during the quarter for $16.3 million and a reminder that we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO. Preferred stock cash dividends totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter and it increased compared to last year, reflects our issuance of the preferred F stock earlier this year. Excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed refers again to the $3.7 million non-cash redemption charge in the first quarter of last year associated with the repayment of our preferred D stock with proceeds from our new preferred F offering at that time, and reminder of course that the replacement of this preferred D stock in our capital structure did save us about $1 million cash annually and income available to common stockholders was about $28.5 million for the quarter. Reminder that our normalized FFO noted here simply adds back the ARCT merger-related costs to FFO. We believe normalized FFO is a more appropriate portrayal of our operating performance and it is consistent with our public FFO earnings estimates and first call FFO estimates that analysts have published on us. Normalized FFO per share was $0.56 for the quarter, a 9.8% increase versus a year ago and $2.02 for the year, a 2% increase versus last year. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.55 per share for the quarter, a 5.8% increase versus a year ago and $2.06 for the year and 2.5% increase versus last year. And also you will note that in our press release, we did affirm our same earnings estimates for 2013, which were previously disclosed last month when we were finalizing the ARCT transaction. As you know, we also have increased our cash monthly dividend significantly over the past year. In addition to a regular quarterly increases we did a $0.06 annualized increase last August, and this month we have a have a $0.35 annualized dividend increase. We have increased the dividend 61 consecutive quarters and 70 times overall since we went public over 18 years ago. Our current monthly dividend is now just over $0.18 per share, which equates to a current annualized amount of just over $2.17 per share. Our estimated AFFO dividend payout ratio for 2013 is about 91%. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we believe we have continued to maintain a conservative and safe capital structure. In October, as you know, we raised $800 million of new capital with our issuance of $350 million of 2% unsecured fixed rate notes due in 2018 and $450 million of 3.25% unsecured fixed rate notes, due in 2022. At year-end, our $1 billion acquisition credit facility had a balance of only $158 million. However, we did utilize our credit facility for the cash portion of our ARCT acquisition in January, which then increased our credit facility balance to about $700 million. Our credit facility does have a $500 million accordion expansion feature above the $1 billion amount. Our current total debt to total market capitalization is 32% and our preferred stock outstanding only 5% of our capital structure. Our only bond maturity over the next two-plus years is $100 million bond maturity in March of this year. We do plan to raise the new capital during the early part of this year. Use of proceeds will be to repay our credit facility borrowing and thus free the facility up for further acquisition financing this year. So, in summary, we think our overall balance sheet remains healthy. We continue to enjoy excellent access to the public capital markets. Let me turn the call now back over to Tom, who will give you a little bit more background on these results.
Thomas Lewis: Thanks, Paul. As is our custom, I will just kind of run through the different segments of business and let me start with the portfolio. Once again, the portfolio continued to generate very consistent cash flow in the fourth quarter. Generally the tenants are doing very well. No issues that rose with any of the tenants during the fourth quarter and we look for that to be the case here in the first quarter. Also there is nothing out there that we are looking at. On our calls, normally what I will do is talk about some of the metrics relative to the portfolio and how and why quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, and as we have added in this release the supplemental disclosure on the closing of ARCT post year-end, I will also mention, on a pro forma basis, what that does to some of those metrics and give everybody a flavor of how we sit today and then obviously all those numbers will be integrated into our first quarter results little later in to the year. At the end of the quarter, our largest 15 tenants accounted for about 47.1% of our revenue. That’s down 270 basis points from the same period of year ago and now, on a pro forma basis, post ARCT, the top 15 have drop from 47.1% to 42.1% or another 500 basis points. So obviously the acquisition efforts relative to both normal acquisitions and ARCT has had a significant impact in reducing concentrations in the portfolio. That obviously is included in our largest 15 tenants. Cash flow coverages on the retail properties that we have in our top 15 tenants continue to be very strong at about 2.5 time for EBITDAR to rent coverage. So the portfolio continues to operate well there. From an occupancy standpoint, we ended the fourth quarter with 97.2% occupancy and 84 properties available for lease out of the 3,013 we own. That occupancy is up 20 basis points from the third quarter and up 50 basis points from the year ago. On a pro forma basis, post ARCT, that increases another 40 basis points to about 97.7% occupancy as we sit here today. Back on the year-end, before ARCT, as I mentioned, the last few quarters there's three ways to calculate occupancy. The one I just used which is on vacant buildings versus occupied buildings calculation. That’s 97.2. If you add it on vacant square footage versus occupied, it would be at 98.2%. Then the third way uses previous rent on vacant properties against total rent including the previous rents and that would be a 98.5%. So all three are very healthy and all three would be higher under the ARCT calculations. Same-store rents our core portfolio increased 0.4% during the fourth quarter and 0.1% year-to-date. As most of you recall same-store rents have been off a little bit the first three quarters, primarily as a function of a couple of tenants and those are moving out of the numbers. So it went positive in the fourth quarter and volume went up to make it positive for the year overall. Looking forward, we think same-store rent growth should accelerate and move to a more normalized level in the 1%, 1.5% plus range in each quarter in 2013 and we think that will start in the first quarter. With all these acquisitions, obviously the diversification of the portfolio continues to widen substantially. At the end of the year we are at 3,013 properties. That is up 175 properties from last quarter. Then, with 44 different industries now represented in the portfolio with 150 tenants in 49 states. On a pro forma basis, adding in ARCT, it is 3,528. That is up another 515 properties in 48 industries, 202 tenants in 49 states. Industry exposures are well diversified and with the closing of the transaction, specific exposures in certain industries have declined quite a bit, which I think is really meaningful when looking at the portfolio I would note that in some of our larger segments, convenient stores, as an example, is our largest industry at 1,231. That was 14.9% of revenue, down 140 basis points from last quarter and 230 basis points year-over-year. Then pro forma that drops another 330 basis points. So down to around 11.6% of rent. So substantial reductions. Restaurants, and here I will just combine both casual dining and quick service, are now at 12.4%. That is down 80 basis points in the fourth quarter and 400 basis points for the year, and now pro forma drops another 220 basis points to only 10.2% of rent. And importantly, and I have talked about this before for what we want to take the portfolio that the gets the casual dining portion on a pro forma basis down to only 5.6% versus 15% of the portfolio a few years ago. That also take figures of [12-31-7], and that's down 80 basis points and then pro forma, it drops to process 66, so we continue to decrease concentration in some of these larger segments, which is very good progress there. We've also increased the percentage of revenue that is generated from several of the industries on a pro forma basis that we are targeting. Transportation services moves up to about 5.7%, almost all of that comes from our investments in FedEx. Drug stores increases to 6.6%, mostly through additions of additional investment with both, Walgreens and CVS, and then dollar stores now increases to about 5.6% of rent and those investment are primarily with Family Dollar and Dollar General. And the majority of where we added, we believe in those industries are with investment-grade tenants and under long-term leases. The largest industries on a pro forma basis then will be the C stores 116. That's the only industry over 10% now drug stores at 66%, theaters at 64%, transportation services at 57% and then the dollar stores and casual dining, both at 5.6% of revenue and then all other industries come in below 5%, and for those of you too have been with us for a while looking back three, four years, that's pretty meaningful reduction. If we look at it from an individual tenant standpoint, the recent acquisitions ARCT make a lot of changes there also. The largest tenant now is FedEx at 5.5% of rent and L.A. Fitness who we like a lot at 39%, Family Dollar and AMC both, 3.5, Diageo, which are wine operations and BJ's posted 3% and then takes everybody below 3%, so a reduction there too. I mentioned our largest 15 tenants are 42.1% of rent pro forma, and when you get to the 15th largest tenant, we are now down to about only 1.6% of revenue, so very well diversified. Also that's the case from a geographic diversification standpoint. Our average remaining lease length on the portfolio is healthy at about 11.2 years, that's up a bit. Let me kind of circling back to the top 15 tenants for a minute and take a look at that group post the those the ARCT acquisition in 2008 and 2009 as most of you know and we've talked about on a lot of our calls, we went through a strategic evolution where we decided to make some adjustments on a go forward basis in the portfolio, and really just started implementing that in 2010 and kind of the themes we are looking at is targeting certain retail industries relative to the consumer base they serve and really are looking at kind of is it upper income, middle income, or low income consumers and then trying to differentiate between those retailers that sell discretionary goods and services versus those that non-discretionary and trying to focus mostly towards retailers to focus on non-discretionary items. Secondarily, when with middle and lower income consumers to make sure that the retailers we are getting really have a deep value proposition and then thirdly trying to stay with a long-term theme of convenience and necessity. Then as you can see pretty clearly right now in the makeup of the top-15 on a pro forma basis, Family Dollar, Dollar General, BJ'S, Walgreens and CVS are all now in the 15, so that matches with those themes. We also decided to pursue acquisitions outside of retail. That's now little over 22% of our revenue and the FedEx being largest one, and virtually all of those leases and properties are long-term leases to very large tenants with investment-grade ratings. And as a general theme also, both for retail and outside moving the portfolio up the credit curve and working more and more with investment-grade tenants. And if you look at the five of the top-15 tenants were now rated investment-grade versus three years ago and was about 34% of our overall revenue on a pro forma basis now coming from investment-grade. If you include leases with the subsidiaries of investment-grade tenants, that's about 37%, so we really think doing that along with portfolio sales if those initiatives be through, added diversification by industry and tenant or geography or whether its tenant credit or the industries we are targeting and investing in, we believe the quality the cash flow generated by the portfolios have been significantly enhanced over the last three years. We will continue to pursue those initiatives. I am very pleased so far. Let us move on then to first the property dispositions that continues to grow a bit. During 2011, we sold 26 properties for $24 million. In 2012, we sold 44 for $50 million. For 2013, we would anticipate to be at least $100 million and we think we will get more than half of that done in the first half of the year. So we may be able to exceed that number going forward and that will be a thing that we just slowly move ahead. The focus there is really trying to improve the credit quality of the portfolio and decrease our exposures in certain industries. To date, that’s been primarily in restaurants, primarily casual dining which, as I mentioned, continues to decline as a segment in the portfolio. Then we also have targeted convenient stores for a number of sales. Then any properties with tenants that tend to be smaller and we think are more exposed to a downturn in the economy. The focus there is really trying to reduce exposure to this discretionary purchases from (inaudible) income consumers and if you watch them today there is a lot of these people in this country that are living on paycheck-to-paycheck and without savings and any movement or economic event really has an impact on them on a current basis relative to their expenditures. So we are trying to move away from that area and either have a deep value proposition or, as I said, stick with basics. Lets move on to property acquisitions. 2012, as we noted, was a record year for acquisitions. That’s before we get to the ARCT transaction. We continue to be very active moving into 2013. Let me turn it over to John Case who is our Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer and he will walk you through the year and where we see things going. John?
John Case: So the fourth quarter was a very active quarter for us for acquisitions. As you know, we acquired 189 properties, investing approximately $447 million in acquisitions. This was third most acquisitive quarter in our company's history, finishing only behind the fourth quarter of 2006 and the third quarter of last year. The average cap rate of the fourth quarter acquisitions was 7.4% at an average lease term of 15 years. Credit profiles of the tenants we added was quite attractive. 63% of the acquisitions are leased to tenants with investment-grade ratings. These properties were leased to 13 tenants in 10 separate industries. Five of the 13 tenants are new tenant and dollar stores and health and fitness were the largest industries represented. These properties were geographically diversified located in 27 states and 80% of the fourth quarter acquisitions were comprised of our traditional retail assets. So for the full year 2012, that brought us to $1 6 billion in acquisitions activity comprised of 423 properties. This is the most we have ever completed in any calendar year and it surpassed our previous record in 2011 of $1.02 billion. The full year acquisitions were done at an average cap rate of 7.22% with a weighted average lease term of just over 14.5 years. We continue to improve our tenant credit profile, as Tom has alluded to, last year 64% of the acquisitions were leased to tenants with investment-grade ratings. They were leased to 29 tenants in 23 separate industries. Dollar stores, wholesale clubs and fitness were the largest industries represented in last year's acquisitions. We were able to 16 new tenants in four new industries. The properties were located in 37 states and 78% of the acquisitions were comprised of our traditional retail assets. About 80% of our acquisitions activity last year was comprised of larger portfolio transactions. These are transactions that are $75 million or greater. So those larger transactions are really what drive our volume from year-to-year as you know. Let me spend a few minutes talking about the acquisitions market today. It continues to be as active as we have ever seen it. In 2012, we sourced $17 billion in acquisition opportunities. Now this outsourcing number is everything that comes in our door in terms of acquisitions' opportunities that meet some of our investment parameters, so we analyze this and we are on a fair amount of amount of it and eventually we ended up closing the $1.1 6 billion. The $17 billion was also a record year for acquisitions, sourcing and transaction flow for us surpassing 2011 when we sourced $13 billion in acquisition opportunities. Of the properties we sourced last year about 55% were leased to investment-grade tenants. Today, the market continues to be competitive. Looking forward, we continue to see an active pipeline of opportunities. There are a lot of sellers in the market that are attracted by the attractive pricing and significant transaction volumes we are seeing in the net lease sector today. We're engaged in numerous discussions and we are currently projecting $550 million acquisitions at an initial yield of 7.25% for 2013, but the ultimate amount now we complete will be determined by our success on the larger portfolio of transactions as we've discussed before. Let me spend a moment on pricing. Cap rates are holding steady to where they were in late 2012. Investment-grade properties ranged from a low 6% to low 7% range, non-investment grade properties range in the low 7% to the low 8% cap rate range. Cap rates have continued to decline over the last few years. Of course, year they averaged 7.2%. In 2011, they averaged 7.8% and in 2010, 7.9%. This is a function of declining yield and interest rate environment and also more importantly are working up the credit curve and doing substantially more acquisitions with investment-grade tenants. Our investment spreads and margins, however, continue to increase and are at historical highs. Let me spend a moment this. Our 2012 average cap rate of 7.22% represents the 190-basis point spread to our nominal cost of equity. And again, that's our FFO yield adjusted for the cost of raising the equity. That 190 basis points compares favorably to our average spread of 114 basis points over the previous 19 years of our company since right our IPO, and with the acquired assets primarily leased to non-investment-grade tenants. In 2011, our spreads to our nominal cost of equity was 170 basis points with 40% of our acquisitions were with investment-grade tenants, so we improved our spreads by 20 basis points year-over-year, while we increased our percentage of acquisition leased to investment-grade tenants from 40% in 2011 to 64% in 2012. This was a very attractive outcome for us. Now, as you know, we also track our cap rates relative to 10-year treasury yields. Since our IPO in 1994, our cap rates have averaged about 475 basis points over the corresponding 10-year treasury yields. In 2012, our cap rates averaged 545 basis points over the average 10-year treasury yield with 64% of our acquisitions leased to investment-grade tenants. In 2011, our cap rates averaged 505 basis points over the 10-year treasury yield with 40% of our acquisitions again leased to investment-grade tenants. So, we've been able to improve our investment spreads based both, on our nominal cost of equity and 10-year treasury yields while continuing to move up the credit curve in 2012. Tom?
Thomas Lewis: Thanks, John. We are obviously very pleased with acquisitions closed for the year and where spreads are given increasing credit as John said and remain optimistic about additional acquisitions this year and what is pretty robust flow of opportunities to look at right now. I would like to note the timing of the acquisitions that came in for 2012. It's kind of interesting to examine. In the first quarter of last year, we acquired a grand total of two properties for $10.7 million. In the second quarter we acquired 145 properties for $210.8 million. Third quarter, acquired 87 properties for $496 million. Then, in the fourth quarter acquired 189 properties for $446.5 million. Couple of thoughts on that. Our acquisitions, and we have talked about this over the years, but for anybody new, it tends to be lumpy. That was the case in 2012 and we think that will continue to be the case quarter-over-quarter. I wouldn’t look at that as a trendline. They tend to bounce around during the year. It is also ultimately, the volume, as John said, the function of how many larger transaction we closed or don’t close. So far this year, we think $550 million we are using for planning purposes. It is the most we want to model this early in the year. Even though we think, at this point, the first half of 2013 will be stronger than the first half of 2012 but we will adjust that as the year goes on but that’s what our guidance is based on. Again, the big transactions are really going to drive that. The other ongoing observation is that acquisitions tend to accelerate late in each quarter and certainly later in the year. That was again the case in 2012 with $942 million of the $1.16 billion coming in the second half of the year. That means a couple of things. The first is the majority of the revenue and FFO from 2012 acquisitions will manifest itself here in 2013. That’s pretty typical. It also means we bought and closed on 276 properties for $942 million in really the last five months of the year and that was at the same time that we were working on preparing for the closing of the ARCT transaction with another 500 plus properties. I would really like to take a second and give credit to our staff, particularly acquisitions and legal and accounting teams for their efforts over the last few months of the year when the productivity, to say the least, was really outstanding and the hours put in were long. We have talked a couple of times over the last few years about working on our systems and adding staff to handle additional growth which we have been doing for a couple of years. I will tell you doing that really paid off and allowed us to process that additional volume and move to efficiently integrate it into our systems and portfolio. I would note though that we will need to do that again to continue to grow at a substantial rate. Gary Malino, our President, Chief Operating Officer and I will spend a fair amount of our time this year focused on that again on people and systems. Let me talk specifically for a moment about the ARCT integration process. That’s going very smoothly, as a great deal of the work was done during the solicitation process on the transaction. But it is a huge volume of work. The tough stuff that was done really as we went along and are mostly done, are the loan assumptions, the entity consolidations, lease reviews, property reviews, title and accounting is pretty much finished. We are really just down to a few outliers here and there. So I would characterize the integration overall as about 80% to 90% finished here just a couple of weeks after closing. We were helped significantly by the fact that both companies utilize the same software platform, which really helped the integration and then also as you recall in this, there were no management or employee integration issues that came with the transaction. So the majority of what is left is primarily additional data entry and submerging the files and in some remaining lease compliance work. We think we can get almost all of it, if not all, done here in the first quarter. Anyway, to tie-up acquisitions, we think both on a granular basis and on larger transactions, it will continue to really be acquisitions but it is going to drive the revenue and play the largest role there in our AFFO and our dividends and certainly in the efforts to make ongoing change in the portfolio. To put it in perspective relative to those changes, the last 36 months or so, we have acquired, about $6 billion of property, including ARCT. $3.6 billion or 60% of it is in retail and most in sectors that we are targeting and we think we will continue to perform for us in what's been a pretty tepid retail environment $2.4 billion or 40% is outside of retail in the sectors with very large tenants. We think will do fine. Then of the $6 billion, $3.8 or 63% was done with investment-grade tenants and a good measure of the rest of the acquisitions, all were also up the credit curve from where the portfolio stood if you go back four or five years. So good progress on that plan. The other side of that is also funding these transactions. In funding them last three years, we've executed four equity offerings that generated about $1 billion in proceeds. And then in the ARCT transaction did a direct issuance of about $2 billion of equity, so it was about $3 billion of issuance. We did as you recall last year about little over $400 million in perpetual preferred, about $1.12 billion in investment-grade rated bonds and notes that we put out and assume $710 million in mortgages, most of which we plan to pay off in the next few years and then generated about $100 million property sales, so about $5.3 billion of capital on that $6 billion in acquisitions. Relative to the balance sheet and access to capital, we are in pretty good shape as Paul mentioned. We do have dry powder to close acquisitions. The $1 billion credit facility with $500 million accordion is very helpful in that, but obviously and as Paul alluded to given the closing of ARCRT and the balance on the line, we'll look to access additional capital. Equity is attractive here as is debt preferred and they are all available and the rates are good. And, for those of us who has followed us a while, I think will want to keep the balance sheet conservative and so the mix of capital should remain pretty similar relative to the debt equity and preferred to where we've been for a number of years now. 2012, good year as I mentioned. A lot of activity that will accrue to our benefit this year. Paul mentioned, we are keeping with the FFO guidance at of $2.32 million, $2.38 million. That's 14.9% to 17.8% growth and AFFO of $2.33 million to $2.39 million, which is 13.1% to 16% growth. Last comment will be on dividends. Obviously the last six, eight months have been active with substantial increases in the dividend approaching around $0.42 a share and we remain optimistic that our activities will support continued dividend increases during 2013, and I appreciate everybody's patience, but I think we got the most of it. And, Katya, we will now open it up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Emmanuel Korchman. Please come ahead.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: Good afternoon, guys. Just given John's commentary earlier on the call about an attractive environment for sellers and pricing staying flat to let's call it a little bit richer than it's been over the last couple of years. Why aren't you selling more into it? I mean, 100 million of dispositions, especially as you try to ramp up, your investment-grade portion of the portfolio seems like it's a low number.
Paul Meurer: Well, I noted it is accelerating, but you are right and we would like to do more, but one of the things that John mentioned was about 80% of the acquisitions are in large transactions and about 100% of the sales are in one-off transactions and rather granular. And if you look at what we have been trying to sell with the C stores and also casual dining restaurants, those are fairly small number, so it is a fairly labor-intensive operation and we also probably would have had a higher volume this year, but we did have a big block of properties probably another $50 million, $60 million that we just started to put on the market and then some M&A activity with the tenant started and that turns out we are getting an upgrade in some of the credit and may not want to sell it. So, I agree. We would like to accelerate it. It is a good market to do into, and if we can go well past the $100 million, we would like to do it.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: Got you, and then I think you touched on this earlier. I might have missed it. the 0.1% same-store growth. Can you first of all clarify if that's GAAP or cash, and then I think you said that that would accelerate as some tenants get pulled out of the mix. Maybe if you could just repeat that for me?
Paul Meurer: Sure. Yes. It was 0.1% for the year overall and 0.4%. That is cash not GAAP, and normally will run from 1 to 1.5, and if you recall at the start last year we had to tenant issues Friendly's and Buffets, where we did have some rent reductions and during the year we disclosed both, what it would be without and with it for the year that's how you get to that 0.1% numbers, but a lot of that burned off the fourth quarter. Absent that, I think, same-store rent growth this year would have been 1.3% to 1.5%, somewhere in there. And, so with that burning off and the way the leases were structured, no tenant issues. We really anticipate the first-quarter will bounce back closer to 1.5% and then during the year run between 1% to 1.5% same-store rent growth.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: Perfect. My last question, I think you mentioned something about double net properties. Maybe you could help me figure out what that would be?
Thomas Lewis: Sure, it is a large portfolio. So there is a lot of everything and for the most part, it is tripled net lease but in some of these properties that we buy, the lease structure particularly contained from a developer maybe different and maybe taxes, maintenance, insurance, but we may have roof responsibilities, then it’s a new roof down the line. There could be some other things that are in there. So when it's not triple we just call it double but it is probably more like two and three quarters or two and a half. Anybody else want to add in to that?
John Case: That’s right. Most of it is on little bit of property maintenance responsibilities.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: But it typically wouldn’t be anything outside of that. So you wouldn’t be responsible for taxes or anything more major than…
John Case: That can happen all the time but that’s primarily not the case with most of non-full triple net stuff that we own.
Thomas Lewis: It's primarily just responsibilities with regard to roofing and parking on 90% of those.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: Right
John Case: There, a minority of the properties that we think it is important to bring it up that if you see a little bit of property expenses that’s where the words coming from. But don’t see a huge acceleration.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: But otherwise they are similar to the rest of your portfolio in being single tenant large (inaudible).
Thomas Lewis: Yes, and we have had these issues over the years on an ongoing basis. It is just a little larger now. So we brought it up.
Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup: Thank you guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber. Please go ahead.
Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good afternoon. Tom and John, as you were mentioning that increasingly more and more of your regular acquisitions are on investment-grade properties. I am wondering why a lot of those tenants are increasingly looking at net lease financing especially given that they should have other credit availabilities? That should be there. It used to be, I guess, the trade-off for a lot of the tenants was the high-yield market or nothing or net lease financing but I am wondering why more and more of those are looking at net lease financing given the absolutely high coupons that seems to be out there as opposed to other sources of financing? Can you maybe walk us through that a little bit?
Thomas Lewis: Yes, there's always been, I think, in retail, which is a smaller preponderance of it. If somebody is really trying to rollout over time using net lease financing relative to their immediate construction. So that’s has been around, and you have particularly seen it in the drugstore segment. So it's become kind of normal and then crept around more in retail. Sometimes it's with people on the street are really putting some pressure on companies to look at their balance sheet and try and unlock some value. As you know, there is a lot of those discussions today going on around the country on the Opco/propco side and when you get those discussions going, even if people don’t do it then they start looking at what's on the balance sheet and start running the numbers relative to their return on investment and other areas. I think it also started just happening a little bit going back to 2008, 2009 where even some very strong credit started looking at some issues relative to financial flexibility and coming out of that started thinking about real estate a little bit. Traditionally it was less than investment-grade. It was really early 2000, 2001, we started working a lot with private equity and bringing that up. But its a very common discussion now on the street relative to looking at the real estate and using it. So if you get to the Fortune 500 and Fortune 1,000, a lot of their real estate decisions are outsourced with a group of developers and very often there is just a decision when working with the developer that they not going to keep those assets and some of them come off that way. But I think there is just more and more talk going on about what's on the balance sheet and how you provide flexibility and use it. So we haven’t seen it like this relative to those discussions particularly in the investment-grade for as long as I have been doing this.
Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, that’s very helpful. Thanks. Especially after the Diageo acquisition a couple of years ago and as you mentioned with increasingly a greater numbers of REITs out there with the Opco/propco structure. Is that something that you guys would look at with increasingly different asset classes that are out there? Or you would that be a lot less likely to happen?
Paul Meurer: It is it is very interesting. There is an awful lot of discussion and you know we have had a few companies announce that they are either looking at it or going to do it. Then there has been some movement in our equity and that always causes bankers and lawyers and accountants to more and more discussions and that’s kind of the phase it's at right now. Then the question is, will they get done and if they get done, what will a single tenant REIT trade out and are traditional REIT investors going to accept that or is going to trade at a higher yield? If a bunch of them get going then typically the first one's probably do pretty well and then you have to see but relative to what it means to us, I think from a tax standpoint for most of those to be done on a tax-free basis more than 50% of the equity has to remain with the company spinning off and that has to happen for a couple of years, so it would take a bunch of those, A, happening and, B, a couple of years going by. And then C, probably valuations not meeting expectations before there would be some opportunities. And given the size of the portfolio now there might be some places where we could invest. If all of that happened, given our size it really wouldn't hit massive concentrations. Absent that, we just think it's positive to, again begin the discussions are going on in boardrooms around the country about now you can add value using the real estate, and I think it will accrue to our benefit. How much? We just don't know.
Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus: I think the single tenant concept does concern a lot of people, but if that was a 2% tenant exposure for realty income I think a lot of people may just about that differently.
John Case: Perfect. And if it is an investment grade tenant or somebody that we really like an assets or special you could also make that five and six, because if you just look, I mean obviously FedEx does get the real estate off balance sheet that's 5.5%, so now we could take those on and I think in larger numbers as we get larger, but we'd step too if they are.
Paul Meurer: Nothing in the near-term by the way.
Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon. Please go ahead.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Two housekeeping questions. First, apologies if I missed this in your earlier remarks. What was the acquisition expense in 4Q aside from ARCT cost?
Paul Meurer: $2.4 million for the year and I just don't have it on my fingertips on what it was in the fourth quarter.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: I'll follow-up offline. Then secondly, what was the difference between the impairment amounts on the income statement versus the FFO calculation?
Paul Meurer: Where you looking?
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: The first was provisions for impairment on the income statement, let me put my spectacles on, 28.04, and then add back in the FFO calculation was 44.72 and I am just wondering what that difference represents. I recognize that's a smaller number.
Paul Meurer: Right. I am trying to find where you are looking at in the add back, Paula, those are two we'll go figure out.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: That's fine. No problem. And then just sort of a bigger picture just to sort of stay on the theme of the acquisition environment, Tom, I appreciated your color in your prepared remarks on the lines of trade diversification. And aside from your comments about continuing to want to gravitate away from those tenants that have a customer base that are paycheck-to-paycheck, how does that diversification across the line of trades stack up relative to your sort of ideal target. And, how does that compare with the opportunity set that you are seeing currently.
Thomas Lewis: Yes. I mean, the opportunity set is wide, so there is a lot of things that comes across the transom that we might have done a few years ago that we are not doing and moving away from casual dining would be one. We still like convenience store, but that might be another so we could buy a lot more if we really didn't have this view in terms of where we want to take the portfolio. One of the things that's happened that's been very fortunate is a few more of the investment-grade retailers are out in the market with opportunities where they just weren't few years ago, and then also that, we've widened than that, so we can move outside of retail dealing with larger tenants, so that's really given us the opportunity to do that. I think if I could stop my fingers and make an instantaneous change in the portfolio is one of the questions was earlier why don't you go faster. We would like to, but part of this is matching up opportunities and growing cash flow and dividends with what may be burn rate on that selling a few things. So, right now there is plenty of opportunities out there, some of which weren't a few years ago and we really, really do want to migrate the portfolio, particularly up the credit curve and away from casual dining. I keep using that, but I use it because obviously have the consumers in the United States are more are middle lower income and that's where like we are currently seeing with the payroll tax and if $20 or $40 goes out of their paycheck, it goes out at other spending, because there is not a buffer.
Paula Poskon - Robert W. Baird: Great. Thanks very much. That's all I had.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik. Please go ahead.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Hi. Good afternoon thanks for taking my questions, guys. Just a few more on the acquisitions, on the $550 million expectation built in for 2013, does that includes an expectation of any portfolio deals within that 550 million, or would they all be incremental to that?
Thomas Lewis: No, I think it includes portfolio transactions but it's one of those where it looks like the first quarter is going to be pretty good and then you move on from there. We are looking at some portfolio transactions but you don’t know how many come through. So, as you know, in the past we started at 250 and kind of guided up as the year went by, but given the last three years of $1.1 billion $1.7 billion. The flow, we sit here and look at each other, look at the first quarter and say, during the course of the year we ought to get there, but as John mentioned 80% last year was larger transaction. So in this, I would say, at least half is.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Okay, and then you mentioned the increase in staff and adding people to help deal with larger flow of acquisitions. Is that were the majority of the increase in staff is going and could you maybe compare the staff that’s responsible for evaluating these deals today versus what it was, say, in 2009 before you embarked on the portfolio diversification strategy?
John Case: Yes, we probably added a couple people down there in that and in acquisitions a couple people. Then it just floats around the building because a lot of this was systems and just volume. I think looking forward to this year, that’s where the differential will be. I think we may have a pretty good add this year in acquisitions once again and a pretty good add maybe five or six in the research area, be it in real estate research and then maybe an executive or two with specific expertise. Then again, I think, just looking at all the volume we added this year and moving towards capacity, you have to add ones and twos throughout the building by department. So I think this will be the year and it may not be exactly calendar that that will flow in and I am really thinking specifically in research and specific segments with some people we can bring in that have done a lot of work there and research and acquisitions, primarily.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Okay, then the $17 billion you mentioned in deals that came through your door last year. Does that include ARCT?
Paul Meurer: Yes, that does include ARCT.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Okay, and then with regards to the industry exposures you were talking about, I guess in recent history you were comfortable in then some of those industries being near about 20% of revenues. Is there a new target that you have in mind in terms of where you wouldn’t want to go beyond now? I know the C stores are around 12%. Could some industry concentration go higher than that or are you still looking to lower those across the board?
Thomas Lewis: Well, we are at about 20% as the farthest we would ever go but we don’t like 20% near as much as we did, and one of the things just really watching going through the recession, while we sailed through it is those exposures you did sit and worry about, and as we get to the size in 44 different industries, which is very fortunate that you can bring that down. So I now look at 10% as being on the high side and it needs to be just because there is a particular opportunity that came along and its something we really like but we can keep them down around five that is just great the would be a great event. The exception obviously is if you end up working in an industry where you have got three or four really top light Fortune 500 type credit sitting in there. But the answer is, yes, the lower number is better.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Okay, and then last one for me. I think you guys had announced that you would do a dividend increase early this year regardless of whether ARCT closed and I am just wondering what thoughts are going forward in terms of evaluating the fifth dividend increase throughout the year and whether or not you expect that to continue to happen around the August time frame? Or whether those will be more fluid discussions throughout the year?
Thomas Lewis: With the payout ratio, if you look about where guidance is up around 91, I will tell you, we are comfortable, given the size of the portfolio and the added diversification you referenced. We would like to walk that back down but it is really rose been a mid to high 80s type companies. So its not material and whether that happens over a year or two, we are open to. So I am going to first say, it will be a more fluid decision. I think the four increases or something that we would plan on. then it is going to be really taking the pulse. We recently use August. It is usually by then we put a fair amount on the books and then we have some clarity relative to how the third and fourth quarters are going to look. That gives a little ability to see what the impact of that fifth dividend is. Not so much in 2013 but 2014. So we are really not to be in a position to know until we get later in the year, but given obviously we did the increase in August $0.06 a share and then we did $0.35. We front loaded it a little bit of it but I wouldn’t want to take it off the table at this point.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: Right, okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore. Please go ahead.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Hi, good afternoon, guys. Tom, did you guys looking at Cole at all? The Cole that is sold to, in the portfolio, but sold to the Spirit?
Thomas Lewis: We look at lots of stuff, and as you can imagine given the size get an opportunity. Look, we think most everything comes across the line and that be a logical thing to do, but on everything that comes in John references the $17 billion. There is a tremendous amount we've signed confidentiality agreements on and so it's our policy not to reference transactions that we didn't do and so I wouldn't want to go beyond that, but I will tell you there has been a lot of activity in the space over the last year and I did it would be surprising if there were things we didn't look at.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Fair enough. Then do you think there are more of those kind of entities that will be coming along? I mean, is that are we done or is it just coal and ARCT, or they are more out there currently. I am just wondering if they will be making their way to market. 
Thomas Lewis : It's interesting a lot of that is generated by the private REIT space, where there's just a tremendous amount of money being raised through the financial advisor community for those type assets and traditionally if you go back, had this longer life which as of late, Scott, shortened up because the liquidity event is something that obviously is considered favorable by those people that would put these on the client's portfolio for a number of reasons economic being some of it and then secondarily I think it also enhances the, say, business model of the sponsor, and so I would see more coming since there's a lot being raised. And if you look at that business, where traditionally it was a lot wider relative to the property types they were dealing in a good part of businesses net lease today. I think there is more out there and then I would reference back to just a lot of the Opco/propco-type stuff. So, it's hard to what it will be property type stuff, so it's hard to know what it will be but I think there will be some larger transactions coming out there. The good time to mention, we over the years on an M&A slide and you and I have talked about this about, have had a lot of opportunities and things presented that could have been done and one of the real challenges is, underwriting in one fell swoop, big portfolio like this. We spend a lot of time underwriting on a very granular basis and this comes along and it really puts pressure on the underwriting side of it. And if you look at this particular transaction it was one where it was mostly investment-grade and it was a lot of the same tenants we work in, in areas that we had targeted and that was one of the reasons we are do it and it was also a fairly new portfolio, so the leases were long. But, with some of these as they age and they come to market, then it brings up a lot of those issues that might make it a little more troublesome for us, but we do want to look at all them.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Good. Thanks, and that kind of answers a little bit the next question I have which is going back to selling of assets, I mean, I am curious why you guys might not do a portfolio-type sale given that, I understand that there is cash flow implications, but you are obviously buying a lot of things as a matter fact. If you only about $550 million worth of stuff this year, you kind of wonder you would even have to clear the line of credit, so I kind of think you will do more than that. So if you are doing more than that, I mean, why not a portfolio transaction if there is someone that can evaluate the portfolio and then get rid of the bottom 2% of your portfolio kid of thing?
Paul Meurer: Right. While they may be our stepchild, we love our stepchild, and doing it in volume presents some issues for the ongoing cash flow stream and its consistency, which since will be monthly dividend company. That's very important. We did look at a couple of those ideas I referenced earlier about block of C stores and ended up pulling it off the market so we may do a bit more of that. And as were buying like ARCT, I have been asked are you guys going to sell part of that. We really as you know have taken the entire portfolio and do it again and stratify it, and we do have about I would say 20% of the portfolio that we would like to move up over time, but some of those are also properties that have been on the books, so the leases are little shorter and some of them have some other characteristics that make it a little more challenging in a bulk transactions. So, again, I think if people think towards the hundred-and-over number for this year, that's probably the right one.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. very good. Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer portion of the Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Tom Lewis for concluding remarks.

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Realty Income Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is also being recorded today, Thursday, October 25, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host for today, Mr. Tom Lewis, CEO Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.
Tom A. Lewis: Thank you very much, operator, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the conference call to review our operations and results for the third quarter. In the room with me today, as usual is Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and CFO; and John Case, our EVP and CIO and Tere Miller, our Executive Vice – excuse me, Vice President, almost promoted you, Tere, of Corporate Communications. And as always, we’ll say, during this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in the forward-looking statements and we will disclose in greater detail on the company’s Form 10-Q, the factors that may cause such differences. On our call today, we’ll focus on our third quarter and year-to-date operational performance for the company. But before we get into that, let me start with just a brief comment on our merger with American Realty Capital Trust or ARCT. As most of you know, we announced on September 6 that we had reached an agreement to merge the two companies and then after our announcement of the agreement, we filed an S-4 proxy with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is where it sits today and it is currently in review. Following that review, which we anticipate will conclude in the near future, we also anticipate getting a final and then effective proxy sent out to all of the shareholders of both the companies. And at that time, we’ll be having an opportunity to talk to all of the parties involved about what we think is an attractive opportunity for the shareholders of both companies and we then move forward towards an approval of that transaction and ultimately close it, but we’ll engage in that time and I’m sure a fair amount of discussion about it. We continue to anticipate closing the transaction towards the end of the year. So we look forward to more discussion on that once the transaction proxy is effective for us. I’d invite those with any additional questions for now. If they haven’t reviewed the S-4, it is currently filed at Securities and Exchange Commission and is available on EDGAR. And obviously, after we have comments, we’ll make any changes and get that out. Moving then on to our operating results, let me start with an overview of the numbers and Paul as usual, if you’ll do that for us.
Paul M. Meurer: Thanks, Tom. So as usual, I’ll just comment briefly on our financial statements, provide a few highlights of our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 13.2% for the quarter. Our revenue for the quarter was approximately $120 million or $480 million on an annualized basis. This obviously reflects a significant amount of new acquisitions over the past year. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by about $6.2 million in the comparative quarterly period. Depreciation expense obviously increased as our property portfolio continues to grow. Interest expense increased by almost $1.2 million and this increase, this quarter was due to our credit facility borrowings throughout the quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong with interest coverage at 3.7 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.7 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the third quarter were approximately $9.3 million similar to the rate for last quarter. Our G&A expenses increased this year as our acquisition activity has increased. We have added some new personnel throughout the year and our proxy process this past spring was more expensive than usual. We’ve spent $795,000 of acquisition due diligence costs during this quarter and our employee base has grown from 80 employees, a year ago to 92 employees today. However, our current total projection for G&A for all of 2012 is approximately $36 million, which will still represent only about 7.5% of total revenues. Property expenses were just under $2 million for the quarter and these are expenses associated primarily with the properties that we have available for lease. Our current estimate for property expenses for all of 2012 remains about $9 million. Merger-related costs, this new line item refers to the cost associated with the ARCT acquisition. During the quarter, we expensed approximately $5.5 million of such costs and this amount includes accruals for some of the expected total cost for completing the transaction. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company and they were just over $400,000 during the quarter. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $1.9 million. This income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We sold 11 properties during the quarter for $15.8 million, an important reminder that we do not include property sales gains in either our FFO or our AFFO. Preferred stock cash dividends totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter. This increase compared to last year obviously reflects the issuance of our preferred F stock earlier this year. Excess of redemption value, we’re carrying by our preferred shares redeemed, was not this quarter, but it is in the year-to-date column. This refers to the $3.7 million non-cash redemption charge in the first quarter associated with the repayment of our outstanding preferred B stock with proceeds from our preferred F offering. Reminder, that a replacement of the preferred B stock in our capital structure did save us about $1 million cash annually. Net income available to common stockholders was about $27 million for the quarter. Beginning this quarter, we’ve included a normalized FFO calculation. Normalized FFOs simply adds back the $5.5 million of ARCT merger related costs to FFO. We believe normalized FFO is a more appropriate portrayal of our operating performance and is consistent with our public FFO earnings estimates and first call FFO estimate that analysts have already published on us. Normalized FFO per share was $0.52 for the quarter, a 4% increase versus a year ago. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash that we have available for distribution as dividends was $0.52 per share for the quarter; a 2% increase versus a year ago. Year-to-date AFFO was $1.52 per share, also a 2% increase versus last year. While it may vary by quarter, our AFFO annually will continue to be higher than our FFO. So far this year, our AFFO has been $0.05 higher. Our AFFO has been higher because our capital expenditures are still fairly low in the portfolio. We continue to have minimal straight line rent adjustments in our current portfolio and we have some FAS 141 non-cash reductions to FFO for in-place leases acquired in some of the larger portfolio transactions that we’ve done. And then in 2012 specifically, we have the $3.7 million non-cash preferred redemption charge. We increased our cash monthly dividend twice during the third quarter including the larger $0.06 annualized increase in August. We’ve now increased the dividend 60 consecutive quarters and 68 times overall since we went public 18 years ago this month. Our AFFO dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 85%. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we’ve continued to maintain a conservative and safe capital structure, we think. Earlier this month, we raised $800 million of new capital with our issuance of $350 million of 2% unsecured fixed-rate notes due in 2018 and $450 million of 3.25% unsecured fixed-rate notes due in 2022. We were very pleased with the successful offering and we are grateful for the bond investors who continue to support us with their capital. With the bond offering proceeds, we were able to completely payoff the borrowings on our $1 billion dollar unsecured acquisition credit facility, which continues today to have a zero balance. We also have today an excess cash balance of approximately $160 million from the bond offering proceeds. Our current total debt to total market cap is 30% and our preferred stock outstanding still is only 7% of our capital structure. And our only debt maturity in the next three years is $100 million bond maturity in March of next year. So in summary, we currently have excellent liquidity. And our overall balance sheet remains very safe and well-positioned to support our acquisition growth including the ARCT acquisition later this year. Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom and he’ll give you more background on these results.
Tom A. Lewis: Thanks, Paul. And I’ll kind of walk through as is our tradition, the different areas of the business and let me start with the portfolio. During the third quarter, the portfolio continued to generate very consistent cash flow with tenants doing well and no significant issues arising outside of our normal operations. At quarter’s end, our 15 largest tenants accounted for 46.8% of our revenue, that’s down 520 basis points from the same period a year ago and 170 basis points from the second quarter. So our acquisition efforts continue to reduce concentrations in the portfolio. The average cash flow coverage rent at the store level for the tenants remains high at just over 2.5 times, which is very little movement from last quarter with a similar number, but quite healthy. We ended the third quarter with 97% occupancy and 84 properties available for lease out of the 2,838 we own. That occupancy was down about 30 basis points from the second quarter. For the quarter, we had 27 new vacancies. That is a little higher than we usually get and was really a function that we have 25 buffet restaurants that came off lease right at the beginning of the quarter. And we have seen those coming off so I think made some comments on last quarter’s call that occupancy maybe a little softer, but not much, 97% for the quarter. During the quarter, we did release 15 of those. We’ve released another couple since the end of the quarter and they make a good a good part of the 18 properties that we leased or sold during the quarter. We also acquired 87 properties and that was the reason for the movement, but quite solid at 97%. As I’ve mentioned, for the last few quarters and we will each time now is, there is three ways to calculate occupancy: one is taking the number of vacant properties, which is 84 and dividing it by our total of 2,838 properties and that’s how we get to 3% vacancy and 97% occupancy. Second methodology is, take the square footage that is vacant and divide it by the total square footage that would give us a 2.1% vacancy and 97.9% occupancy, 90 basis points higher than the first method. And then the third way, which is more of an economic way of looking at it is, take the previous rent on vacant properties and divide it by the sum of that number and rent on occupied properties. And if you use that methodology, vacancy is only about 1.7% and occupancy 98.3%. Obviously, any of the three represent fairly high occupancy. And in the press release, we use physical occupancy, which is the lowest of the three. Looking to the next few quarters, leasing activity today is brisk. Lease rollover is reasonable. The tenants are generally doing well. So we think occupancy should increase a bit in the fourth quarter and increase a bit going into early next year. So we think the portfolio is fairly sound very soon from an occupancy standpoint. Same-store rents in our core portfolio decreased 1% during the third quarter and 0.8% year-to-date. As we’ve talked about for several quarters now, if we exclude the Buffets and Friendly’s reorganization rent adjustment, same-store rent and the balance of the portfolio increased 1% during the third quarter and 1.1% year-to-date. As we look forward, the impact of those two will now start rolling off. And we think that we’ll probably have flat same-store rent in the fourth quarter and then in the first quarter likely go back to the more typical increase that we’ve had in the past of about 1% same-store rent growth. So we’re optimistic relative to occupancy and same-store rent growth over the next couple of quarters. Diversification in the portfolio continues to widen. 238 properties, which is up over last quarter; 44 different industries, 144 different tenants and the footprint in 49 states. From a geographic standpoint, there are no meaningful concentrations around the country. And probably, more important, industry exposures are very well diversified. Again, with 44 industries now and concentrations in the larger industries are generally continuing to decline each quarter. As you probably saw in the press release, convenience stores, which is our largest industry at 16.3% is down 60 basis points from last quarter and 200 basis points versus a year ago. Restaurants, if you combine both casual dining and quick service, now down to about 13.2%, that’s off 60 basis points from last quarter and 410 basis points versus a year ago. And I think more importantly of note there to us is really the decline that we’ve had in casual dining as we acquire in other areas and we’ve been selling off properties in this area and we think that’ll continue. Casual dining is down, I think, 360 basis points year-to-date. And as the chart on Page 11, I believe, in the press release shows, we’re down to about 7.3% in that sector from over 14% in the last five years or so. And we will continue to reduce that. Theaters are at 9.5%, that’s down a little bit, up for the year. Health and fitness also down a little bit at 6.7%. We continue to like both of those sectors, theaters and health and fitness and I think we’ll be adding to them. And then the only other category industry over 5% is beverages. And additionally this quarter, we added six new industries for the portfolio for the first time. So I think we’re in very good shape and keeping industry concentrations reasonable and generally widening out the diversification. This quarter in our industry table in the back of the press release, we separated our retail industries from our non-retail industries for the first time, which should make it a little easier for everybody to see the activity in each of those areas and basically how it’s moving over time and we hope that is helpful. From an individual tenant standpoint, no tenant now represents more than 5% or more of our overall revenue in the portfolio. Of an interesting note, this is the first time in the 43-year history of the company that that has been the case where no tenant is over 5%. So we continue to become more diversified there. Our largest at forayed is AMC. That’s down a bit. LA Fitness and Diageo are at 4.7% and then everything else is under that. The 15 largest tenants I mentioned is 46.8% of revenue. When you get to the 15th tenant, you’re looking only about 2% of revenue and when you get to number 20, it’s about 1.5%. So we continue to be well diversified. The other thing I would note is the continued transformation in our top 15 tenants over the last few years. As I mentioned, concentrations are down quite a bit. Tenant quality continuing to move up a bit and industry representations are changing as we continue to focus on moving up the credit curve and away from some areas, we think are vulnerable to a consumer downturn and we think the list will continue to transition in the coming quarters based on the transactions we’re undertaking now where we’re quite active. Relative to moving up the credit curve, three years ago essentially none of our rent came from investment grade tenants or the subsidiaries; 43-year old company that’s worked very well, in that entire period, occupancy has never gone below 96%. And obviously earnings and dividend growth has been excellent. But it really is – we are trying to make a move in that direction. And as of the end of the third quarter that number stands a little over, now 20% of the portfolio is generated by investment grade tenants. And upon the closing of the ARCT transaction, that would be roughly 35%. And we continued here in the third quarter and we will in the fourth quarter to buy additional properties leased to investment grade tenants. We’re also adjusting the portfolio by accelerating property dispositions a bit in certain industries. Year-to-date, we’ve sold 30 properties for $34 million. That’s for us about $12 million of sales for the same period a year ago and we think that will continue to increase. We’ll likely sell around $20 million or so in the fourth quarter. That will get us up around $55 million. And then we think likely to run in the $75 million to $100 million run rate, perhaps a little higher over the next year or so. Almost all of the sales to-date, as a matter of fact, all of them out of the investment portfolio what we’re targeting in the industry have been out of the restaurant category with the majority being casual dining restaurants. We have been pleased that the cap rates for sales have been a little better than we thought. The properties would have been closed to-date. The cap has been about $8.19 and on the properties that we currently have under contract for sale now, it’s about $7.55. So it’s been a good environment to be active out in dispositions for us. Finally, on the portfolio, our average remaining lease term remains very healthy at 11 years and so given the long-term leases that we have and increased diversification in the portfolio and then the idea we think that same-store rent should accelerate and also occupancy debt, we’re very optimistic and continue to see very stable revenue production out of the portfolio. Let me move on to property acquisitions. We’re obviously having a lot of success on that front for the first three quarters of the year. We see that continuing this quarter and in the next year. And let me turn it over to John Case, our Chief Investment Officer and you can walk people through what we’re seeing.
John P. Case: Okay. We had a very active third quarter for acquisitions this year. We acquired 87 properties for approximately $496 million. That was our second most acquisitive quarter in our company’s history. We acquired these properties at an average cap rate of 7.11% and the average lease term was 13 years. The credit profile of the tenants we added was very attractive. 51% of the acquisitions are leased to tenants with investments grade credit ratings. These properties are leased to 19 tenants in 18 separate industries and 11 of the 19 tenants are new tenants for us. Approximately, 70% of the acquisitions were in the dollar store, wholesale club, food processing and apparel industries and the acquisitions were well geographically diversified and 19 separate states. Just under 70% of the acquisitions we’re comprised of our traditional retail assets, the majority of the balance of the properties were distribution properties. So through the third quarter of this year, we’ve acquired 234 properties for approximately $718 million at an average cap rate of 7.12%, which we believe is attractive as we continue to improve our tenant credit profile. 64% of the acquisitions year-to-date are leased tenants with investment grade credit ratings. The average lease term of these year-to-date acquisitions has been 14.3 years. There are at least 21 tenants and 19 separate industries and are located in 33 states. 77% of these acquisitions were comprised of our traditional retail assets, and again, the majority of the balance of the properties are distribution assets. Let me spend a minute talking about the current status of the acquisitions market. The market is as active as we’ve ever seen it in our company’s history. To give you an idea of that, year-to-date, we’ve sourced $14.9 billion in acquisition opportunities as a company. Last year, during the entire year, we sourced $13 billion of acquisition opportunities, which was our most active year ever for sourcing acquisitions. About 60% of these properties sourced are leased to investment grade tenants. Now, while the market remains competitive, we’re continuing to pursue a number of these opportunities and expect to close over $1 billion in organic property level acquisitions for 2012. And of course, this would exclude our acquisitions that will be part of our merger with ARCT. And looking forward, we really don’t see a slowdown in acquisition opportunities. There are a lot of sellers in the market for a number of reasons today and we continue to be engaged in a number of discussions with those sellers. We remain optimistic relative to both our near-term and intermediate-term acquisition opportunities. Let me spend a second on cap rates. As you may have noticed, the cap rates have contracted a bit more during the year. However, we believe we’ll end the year with average cap rates in the 7.25% area. The investment grade properties that we pursue are currently trading in cap rates in the low 6% to low 7% range. And the non-investment grade properties are trading in the low 7% to low 8% cap rate range. Our investment spreads continue to be at historical highs, though. Our year-to-date average cap rate of 7.12% represents a 185 basis point spreads, our nominal cost of equity, which again, is our FFO yield adjusted for our cost of raising equity. That 185 basis points compares quite favorably to our average spread of 110 basis points over the previous 17 years when the vast majority of our acquisitions were with properties – on properties lease to non-investment grade and investment grade tenants. In 2011, our spreads or our nominal cost of equity on our acquisitions was 170 basis points when 40% of the acquisitions were with investment grade tenants. So we’ve been able to improve our investment spreads to 185 basis points while continuing to move up the credit curve this year with 64% of our acquisitions being leased to investment grade tenants. So it’s a great time for us to acquire very attractive spreads while enhancing the credit profile of our tenant base. Tom.
Tom A. Lewis: Thanks, John. Obviously, we’re pleased with the acquisitions we’ve closed year-to-date and that are expected to close in the fourth quarter and certainly where spreads are as John mentioned. And we also think that we’ll start the year off in 2013 faster than we did this year given the transaction flow. If you recall a year ago, the first quarter was fairly slow relative to closings. And this is all on really the property by property or portfolios we’re seeing here on a granular basis, individual properties and really not part of any volume that comes from M&A. And if you look at the ARCT transaction upon that close, that would get us to about $4 billion in additional assets for the year. And while that’s been the news as of late, the $1 billion plus in normal acquisitions for this year as John mentioned would be a record for the company. I mentioned last quarter and it still holds true and we think it will going forward that acquisitions will continue to play a big role in continuing to grow our revenue and AFFO, which is what will drive dividend increases. And then secondly and equally important to us in adjusting the makeup of our portfolio as time goes on where we’re moving up the credit curve and we’ve made good progress on that front again, this quarter. Paul talked about the balance sheet in excess to capital. Obviously, we’re in very good shape there with plenty of dry powder to execute on acquisitions as they present themselves. Obviously, the $1 billion credit facility is very helpful for that and that is fully available. And as Paul mentioned, we also have $160 million in cash on the balance sheet. So a lot of capital to do we need to do. Obviously, relative to permanent capital out there, the markets remained open and quite attractive. Looking at the execution on the recent debt offering obviously, pricing is just absolutely outstanding and historic in the REIT industry and certainly for us on that transaction. Equity is attractively priced. And as is preferred and given cap rates may be 7.25% level for the year spreads very attractive. Relative to the guidance that we put out a month or so ago, there was no changes on that. In 2012 guidance excluding the one-time costs of the ACRT transaction, we’re looking at $2 to $2.4 per share for the year. Included in that, as Paul mentioned, is the $0.03 per share non-cash charge from the redemption of our preferred earlier in the year, and the AFFO of $2.06 to $2.11 per share, which would be about 2.5% to 5% AFFO growth. And as always, that’s our primary focus as it best represents the recurring cash flow from which we pay our dividends. On 2013 guidance, again, assuming a 12.31 closing of the ARCT transaction, we’re looking for $2.30 to $2.36 per share and AFFO of $2.31 and to $2.37 that’d be 9.5% to 15% AFFO growth for the year. And again, really is the focus given we pay dividends out of that. Speaking to dividends, we remain optimistic that our activities will support the ability to continue increase the dividend. As Paul mentioned, we increased it $0.06 in August and ended the regular quarterly increase in September. And as most of you know, we’ve also mentioned that we closed the ARCT transaction. We probably raised the dividend about $0.13 a share. And historically, what we’ve done for those that haven’t been with the company a long time, we raised the dividend in fairly equal amounts each quarter and then really looked in our August Board meeting to see if a fifth larger increase in the dividend is warranted, in order to keep our payout ratio at about 85% to 87% or so of FFO, which is our target. Our AFFO payout ratio is in that range now, and obviously, the AFFO growth for next year looks pretty attractive. And in the mid-range of the guidance that would likely get our AFFO payout ratio down around 83% or so by the end of next year, which is below where we target. So at this point, we’d anticipate 2013 to be another pretty good year for dividend growth also. I think that’s it relative to walking over the different pieces of the business. And, operator, if we can, we’ll go ahead and open it up for questions.
Operator: Absolutely (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Emanuel Porchman with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Emanuel Porchman – Citigroup:  Hey, guys, how are you?
Tom A. Lewis:  Good.
Emanuel Porchman – Citigroup:  Looking at the distribution facilities that you acquired, I know, Tom in the past, you’ve spoken about looking at distribution sort of in parallel with retail. Was that the case here? Was there an overlap with your existing retail tenants I guess before buying those distribution facilities?
Tom A. Lewis: Actually no, the majority of the retail tenants as you know before three years ago were all less investment grade. And our comfort level historically on retail is obviously having cash flow – EBIDTA cash flow coverage numbers and knowing the P&Ls of the stores we own. And when we move into the distribution facilities, you really don’t have that. So you’re relying more on the real estate itself. And what you’re buying and how important it is to the tenant and their need to really use that particular facility. And so for us also then what we want to do is, we want to be going up the credit curve when we’re working on those type of properties. And that’s the majority of what we’re doing. So it’s really going to the Fortune 500 or Fortune 1,000 and approaching them, relative to those distribution facilities and trying to buy ones that are either well priced and in very good areas for them to support their long-term activities or perhaps they’re right next door to a manufacturing plant for one of their main product lines. So if you kind of look through the distribution facilities that we bought and in kind of in the last quarter, the tenants on those were, as an example, Whirlpool Corporation was one, another tenant was Procter & Gamble, another one was PepsiCo, another one was, obviously FedEx and another Toro. So all very large investment grade names and that’s generally where we’re focusing. And I don’t think we own more than one or two distribution facilities and those we bought some time ago with tenants are non-investment grade
Emanuel Porchman – Citigroup:  Okay. And then looking at the ARCT transaction sort of, say that’s closest, does that change the way you approach acquisitions to you than expand your net on what you’re out there looking at?
John P. Case:  I don’t think it will materially change where we are right now. As we’ve said, in retail, there are areas that we’ve bought in the past that we just want to hold on, those we want to sell, and then a number that we still find attractive. And then outside of that, it’s really distribution a little manufacturing, a little bit of office, but not much, and perhaps agriculture, but all investment grade tenants is what we want to do there. And that’s where we’re focused. So that’s pretty much what we get in the ARCT transaction. And so I would imagine that we’ll stay right on that.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:   Hey, Tom, it’s Michael Bilerman speaking. Good afternoon to you.
Tom A. Lewis:  Hey, Mike.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  A quick question just going to the ARCT transaction, in a little bit more depth. You’re clearly aware that there’s probably little bit more investor frustration at least on the ARCT side of the transaction and some pretty vocal shareholders who effectively are going to vote no, as the current deal stands. And I’m just curious as how you’re sort of dealings towards that clearly the proxy is out, and everyone can read it, but you were the only bidder. And that was the negotiated transaction that occurred. But do you have, a lot of accretion built into the deals for next year, you’ve communicated a sizable list in the dividend. I guess do you sort of walk away if they vote no?
Tom A. Lewis: Well, obviously if there is a no vote in the transaction, yes we would walk away. We think and if you look at the proxy and I also want to say that again, since it’s in the SEC and there’s likely to be some comments. We want to make sure we don’t go into too much detail until have a final and effective proxy. But if you read the background section, you can see that the negotiations were discussed over time and both parties kind of drew a line, well it’s valuation is to where they wanted to go, and we weren’t able to get there. And then after – they started trading that both of the equities moved in a fashion, so we could put together a transaction. But our feeling is that at the time that was announced, it was around a 5\9 cap rate, today on price, it’s around six. And it’s a very good portfolio, 75% investment grade, it fits what we’re trying to do strategically very carefully. But we think we paid a bit of a premium to capture this large portfolio and did so with an attractive issuance of equity. But for us, the price that we’re paying here is we think a full price in and yes, we would walk away. As we mentioned, we have $1 billion plus in acquisition. So that’s granular and we also have a great feeling about how next year is going to work out and so we would do that. However, we do believe that the majority of the shareholders once we have the final perspective, their proxy out, we’ll be able to engage in conversations and think we will get a yes vote on the transaction from both groups of shareholders for whom we think there are very good benefits.
Emanuel Porchman – Citigroup:  Is there any cost, if there is a no vote? Do you have to incur or any sort of cost? Obviously, there were some cost to the transaction that, but what would that sort of, is there any penalties or anything that would; we’d have to be mindful of?
Tom A. Lewis: Yeah, I think it’d be minor if there was a no vote by either party and I think in our case, I think we would have about $4 million that would be due as to pay for the fees of the transaction. And then we’re figuring out exactly what those would be if there was a no vote. But it’s relatively closer to that that would pay for the majority of it. And that really wouldn’t see a significant impact. I think it’s the same on the other way with that for us in a no vote. But I don’t think there’s much if any chance of that whatsoever.
Emanuel Porchman – Citigroup:  And then I just guessed you had raised a lot of unsecured debt capital. So effectively, you’d be a little bit, I guess over capitalized from that standpoint relative to the transaction?
Tom A. Lewis: Yeah, we would not be, actually Michael, we had obviously a very big quarter in acquisitions and we look for a substantial quarter in the fourth quarter and running the number backwards to get to a little over $1 billion in acquisition. So really with $160 million sitting in cash, we’ll easily use that for closing properties in the fourth quarter. And then it just means the full line would be fully available if we did not do the transaction. And if we do the transaction which we fully anticipate, we can do it on the line.
Emanuel Porchman – Citigroup:  Okay, great. Well it’s good to hear that you are going to stick firm on your exchange ratio and not try to engage in a self bidding.
Tom A. Lewis:  Right. Thank you.
Emanuel Porchman – Citigroup:  Thank you very much.
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Joshua Barber – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good afternoon.
Tom A. Lewis: Hi, Josh. 
Joshua Barber – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: You guys have covered most of my questions already. Just one quick one, I guess getting to the enterprise value that you will be post ARCT. At least assuming that there will be a post ARCT, what would you say your minimum deal size is when you’re looking in the acquisition market today and how that has changed over the last couple of years?
Tom A. Lewis:  Yeah, it’s really grown over the years. We’ve always been more than willing to do a one-off transaction of a small nature and add it and happy to do that today. But over the years, we’ve gone where $50 million back when we were $500 million in assets would be a 10% allocation to a tenant. And that was kind of our threshold. And sitting at $11.4 billion, you can go out and do a $0.5 billion transaction with a tenant and still retain under 5% with an individual tenant and then relative to a portfolio or additional M&A, with a multiple tenant portfolio. It really gives us a lot of flexibility. So the ability to do larger transaction is certainly enhanced by completing this merger.
Joshua Barber – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  Okay, and one last thing. You had mentioned some comments about CapEx and why straight-line rents were a bit higher this quarter. Would you expect some more of that, I guess in the next couple of quarters with Buffet’s and Friendly’s releasing, we think process is mostly done at this point?
Tom A. Lewis:  Yes, we’re pretty well along the way of getting the majority of anything from Friendly’s or Buffet’s done. So there shouldn’t be a lot there relative to CapEx on that.
Paul M. Meurer:  Yeah, CapEx overall Josh, has gone up a little bit. Historically, we had virtually none. Our current projected run rate for this year and next year is about $6 million to $7 million total which of course is on a $500 million plus revenue portfolio. So still a relatively small number, but a little higher than it has been in the past. Some of that is investing in existing properties to assist in the re-leasing of those as you’ve guessed. But overall, still the large portion of the portfolio or most and all of it is more so triple-net and we’re not responsible for those sorts of expenses.
Joshua Barber – Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  Okay, that’s great. Thanks very much guys and good luck.
Operator:  Thank you. And then next question comes from the line of RJ Milligan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Richard J. Milligan – Raymond James & Associates:  Hey, good afternoon guys.
Tom A. Lewis:  Good afternoon Rich.
Richard J. Milligan – Raymond James & Associates:  Couple of questions. Going forward for 2013, do you think the mix of retail versus non-retail at 75:25, do you expect that to continue?
Tom A. Lewis:  It’s going to be transaction-driven, RJ, that we think that’s a very nice mix, but if that was 60:40, that wouldn’t really bothered us either way. We’re really out after those areas of retail that we can buy quite aggressively, and if there was 100% quarter where it was all on the retail, that’d be fine with us too. And looking quarter-to-quarter, we’re really not focused on trying to balance that, but overall, if I had to guess 75:25 is not a bad number, 60:40 is not a bad number.
Richard J. Milligan – Raymond James & Associates:  Now, in terms of the opportunity set, is there a larger opportunity set of acquisitions in the non-retail bucket and you’re just choosing to pursue that 75:25 mix or what do the opportunities look like?
Tom A. Lewis:  I’ll let John comment, but it’s changing as time goes on, as it’s been interesting over the years. In the mid ‘90s, we entered the convenience store business and it really took us two, three years where everybody that was in that business knew we were out acquisitive and we were really able to accelerate thing, and in movie theaters, it was the same thing. And so, now for really last year and this year, and in particular mostly this year because most of what we bought in that area last year came from the ECM transaction. We’re now getting traction with people knowing that we are out there and we are buying this type of property. So our flow is increasing.
John P. Case:  Yeah. So let me give you an idea for the distribution of property types within that transaction flow. So what we’ve sourced a $14.9 billion year-to-date that I referred to earlier, about 60% of that is retail properties. And the next largest chunk of that is distribution and industrial at about 25%. So that’s how it shapes out. But it does have inflow depending on what the opportunities are at any specific point during the year. But that will give you a feel for what it looked like year-to-date herein 2012.
Richard J. Milligan – Raymond James & Associates:  Okay. Thanks. And, Tom, as part of that strategic review that you guys did a couple years ago, where you decided that you wanted to move up the credit curve part of that if I recall was, wanting to hedge yourselves against inflation and trying to put in contractual rent bumps or CPI bumps into the leases and increase the percentage of leases that you had with those bumps. Now with ARCT, I’m assuming most of those don’t have any bumps or CPI protection. And I’m just wondering, how you thought about the trade-off there for going up the credit curve yet sort of taking a step back in terms of inflation protecting the portfolio.
Paul M. Meurer:  Yeah. A lot of the leases do have bumps, but that’s one of the most difficult things over the last few years has really been trying to building full CPI into the leases and we’ve gotten up and I can’t remember the exact number, but it’s over 20%.
Tom A. Lewis:  Yeah, it over 20%, Paul says now that we’ve been able to do that, but it is really a slog. We’ve had 30 years here of declining interest rates and relatively tame inflation and across industries in the U.S., the sellers and particularly in retail have gotten very used to not having big CPI components. So that continues to be a battle on that situation. Relative to going up the credit curve, the decision to go up the credit curve really was two-fold. One was thinking that retail maybe a little tougher in the future particularly in some segments. But mostly, we’re just – I think September 30 was the 31 anniversary of the 10-year getting up over 14% and starting its decline, that’s gone on ever since then where we’re now down to 1.88. I think I looked this morning. And if you look at the average rate on a 10-year over the last 31 years, it’s been about 6%. So it was really going back completely underwriting our whole portfolio and acknowledging that we are all kind of running downhill with less than investment grade tenants during that period. And that as we look to going forward and the possibility of interest rates being higher, wanting to disengage from a few tenants that we think would be vulnerable in a raising interest rate environment and move up the curve to protect against that. And everybody’s got their opinion of what the chances are of having much higher interest rates, but we also think even if there was prolonged lower interest rates due to economic weakness, it’s likely to be tough on the more levered people’s business and likely that we would eventually see some credit spreads gapping out. So either way, we think it’s really a good idea to move up the curve. And that was the primary reason behind that one. And going forward, again, we’re at 20% now closing ARCT, we’d be at about 34%, 35% and be very happy to wake up in four, five years and have that number 60%, 70%, 80% of the portfolio.
Richard J. Milligan – Raymond James & Associates:  Okay. So the acquisition is actually going to increase the percentage of the portfolio that has sort of the CPI bumps?
Paul M. Meurer: It now, it’s about the same.
Tom A. Lewis:  Well, his comment going 20 to 35, he was referring to the investment grade portion.
Paul M. Meurer:  Yeah. Sorry. Investment grade not the part with bumps. I think it’ll keep us right about 20, maybe a little less little more.
Richard J. Milligan – Raymond James & Associates:  Okay. And then, a quick question for you, Paul. As we’re just looking at our models and thinking about the proceeds to pay for acquisitions in the ARCT transaction, would you expect, say a year from now, leverage to be pretty similar to where it was a quarter ago, or how are you thinking about leverage and what’s your target over the next year?
Paul M. Meurer:  Yeah. As you know, our philosophy is still, go up first, if you will, two-third is common, the remainder really the debt and preferred side in the capital structure. With this recent bond offering, as we speak and sit here today, our leverage, I’d say is a little higher than what we’d like is kind of a longer term run rate, 30% debt, 7% preferred. We prefer that to be 5% to 10% lower in terms of that portion. So we will look to the common equity markets first as a form of financing over the next 12 to 15 months in terms of the balance sheet.
Tom A. Lewis: The other thing is, I think it was 1994 right, when we went public that we said that we wouldn’t want to be over 35% debt on the balance sheet and we’ve never gotten there. And we had a discussion at our board meeting in August just saying that, remains even though we’re – gosh, 20 time the size than we were then. But that, we think is in an appropriate balance sheet strategy. And in the ‘20s, we don’t mind at all either.
Richard J. Milligan – Raymond James & Associates:  Okay, great. Thank you, guys.
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America Merrill Lynch Please go ahead.
Craig R. Schmidt – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch:  Thanks. I was wondering is there also a push for more investment grade tenants within the retail space?
Tom A. Lewis: There is. As a matter of fact within retail, we also have a higher percentage going up. If you look in the top 15 in the press release, I think it’s Family Dollar crept in there and we have had some transaction recently with several other investment grade tenants in that space. So we’d like to go up the curve where ever we can both inside and outside. And so that’s definitely the case. And John, if we have any other numbers there, do you for the year within?
John P. Case:  I don’t think we parsed it within retail, Craig. But a good part of the retail this year has been investment grade.
Craig R. Schmidt – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch:  Okay. Do you have to pay a lower cap rate for those investment grades or is that like a agnostic view?
Tom A. Lewis: You generally do have to pay a lower cap rate. And almost like in the bond markets today, credit spreads are fairly flat. And they do continue to be fairly flat in the net lease business, but it is lower. As John mentioned for investment grade, you’re kind of in the 6% to 7% cap rate, for less investment grade 7% to 8%. But given cost to capital, when you look today that over 60% of what we bought this year so far and what we’re targeting, is investment grade. But we’re getting an average cap rate of about 7.25%. It’s really one of those funny times when you can go up the curve and still have great spreads. Recall about 16, 17 years ago, Bank of New York very nicely gave me two – couple of days with their head of credit for Bank of New York, just to talk to him about credit and underwriting and all the rest of it. And I remember sitting down and he said, what are you trying to do? And I said, well I want to increase our volume of acquisitions substantially, I’d like to go up the credit curve and I’d like to have higher spreads between our cost to capital and our interest rate. And he laughed, he said so does every banker in the world who’s lending, but it’s almost impossible to do. And I look at this year and last year given Fed monetary policy and that’s exactly what happened at $1 billion plus an acquisition in each year. And going up the curve, substantially and the spreads between cost of capital and cap rate, as John went through, being some of the highest we’ve had, maybe 70 basis points over the average for 17, 18 years we’ve been public.
John P. Case: Craig, slightly over 50% of the retail we purchased this year to date has been with retail tenants that have investments grade credit ratings.
Craig R. Schmidt – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch:  Okay. I guess we’re living in an impossible time, but it sounds good. Thanks a lot.
Tom A. Lewis:  Yeah, I’m not sure what it does for the economy in the world long-term, but in the short-term in the net lease business it’s been fairly attractive for us.
Craig R. Schmidt – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch:  Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik with Morningstar. Please go head.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar Research:  Hey, good afternoon, guys.
Tom A. Lewis:  Hey, Todd.
John P. Case:  Hey, Todd.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar Research:  Just a question on the capital structure, and I know the preference has always been for the corporate unsecured. And I think you stated that the mortgages that are coming on the balance sheet with some of these acquisitions are you hope to pay those down as soon as possible. But I’m wondering with the move into non-retail and investment grade and with some of the property values maybe being higher now that you’re acquiring than maybe the average has been in the past and also with the investment grade tenants paying the rents if your views changed at all and whether or not there is a place for mortgages in the capital structure going forward or whether you’d like to stick with 100% corporate unsecured?
Tom A. Lewis:  Sure. Good question. Now we continue to absolutely pursue the flexibility of dealing in the unsecured markets with the debt and keeping the balance sheet in line. And the only mortgages that we have had to date are those where we bought a portfolio and it was really uneconomic in the short term to payoff the mortgage that anything we could payoff, we will. We’ve never put a mortgage on a property and we don’t intend to going forward, it’ll strictly be when we buy a portfolio. And then we’ll soon as – it’s economic to do so, we would pay it off and we’re very, very much committed now as have been to the unsecured market and that being how we finance the company along with perpetual preferred and common equity.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar Research:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Thanks you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Richard C. Moore – RBC Capital Markets Equity Research:  Yeah. Hi, good afternoon, guys. You’ve mentioned before, Tom, that you expect about $50 million of acquisitions per quarter, which of course is what I had modeled for the next four quarters going forward. But given that, it seems to me that there is something fundamentally changing out there that is bringing more products to market. And I’m curious if you have thoughts, I mean, is that more retailers, let’s say, looking to monetize real estate, is that debt coming due, or what is bringing all this stuff to market? This seems to be bigger than usual. Is that correct?
Paul M. Meurer:  It is. And I think as things usually are we’re just looking for one reason, but it’s a confluence of forces. I think the downturn in the economy a few years ago and the credit squeeze scares the heck out of a lot of CFOs. And they started looking at their companies on looking for more non-traditional access to capital and identified real estate as being one source for that. And so I think that’s part of it. Second, as you see more sale leaseback out there, other people observe it, and act towards it. And then I think there is also feeling that, right now, with interest rates low, that this is a way to obviously lock in permanent, permanent capital over very long period of time. And using the real estate while still maintaining the ownership and the flexibility, and that’s – those are all coming together. And then the last part from me and you can add on if you want to John, is our size really and the size of the net lease business is growing and it’s becoming more visible. And it’s allowed us to go into places we haven’t before, particularly going up the credit curve, into the Fortune 500 and that and in by itself through our efforts has caused us to see more product.
Richard C. Moore – RBC Capital Markets Equity Research:  Okay, good. Thank you, yeah that makes sense. Then on the dollar stores, on the addition of the dollar stores category this quarter, is there a story behind that first of all? And I noticed that Family Dollars, I think, 2.5% in the total size of the space is about 3%. So I’m guessing there is obviously more beyond Family Dollar in there, but anyway on the dollar stores?
Tom A. Lewis:  Right. As part of the strategic review, one of the things we did is, obviously take a look at the consumer and really divided up to upper income, middle income, lower income. And then divided further between their discretionary and non-discretionary spending to try and pick. What retailers we wanted to be with and we think in kind of the middle income, the lower income, it’s a good idea if you could be with non-discretionary spending. And even within that, that’s really a stressed consumer, which I think, leads retailers in that space today, they need to have a really significant value proposition for the consumer. And I think, our movement into dollar stores is a reflection of exactly that, we did target the industry. We think we will have more and you’ll see that grow over the next few quarters. By the way, it’s the same thing with the Warehouse, club stores that you also see has come in there. And both have that value proposition and that’s why we upped our investment there. If you look at the wholesale clubs, I think in this quarter it was around 2.8%. That’s BJ’s and there’s going to be another one coming in there. And then on the dollar stores worth three and that’s Family Dollar and Dollar General, both has been added to the portfolio, both of those investment grade tenants. And we expect – we’d like our allocations to grow up if we can find additional opportunities.
Richard C. Moore – RBC Capital Markets Equity Research:  Okay. So you’re looking beyond Family Dollar and Dollar General as possibilities are really those two are the targets?
Tom A. Lewis: Well, once again we want to go up to credit curves in both our investment grades. So they’re very attractive to us.
Richard C. Moore – RBC Capital Markets Equity Research:  Yeah. I got you. Very good. Thank you, guys. 
Operator:  Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Tom Lesnick – Robert W. Baird & Co.:  Hi guys, good afternoon.
Tom A. Lewis:  Yeah.
Tom Lesnick – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Just a quick question. You mentioned that G&A expense would be about $36 million this year. How should we be thinking about G&A expense going forward presuming the ARCT deal goes through?
Tom A. Lewis: Our estimate for next year, I can give you a number. It’s about $42.5 million, kind of what we see in our model right now. That’s some preliminary work on the budget for next year and that sort of thing. That does assume our ARCT closes end of this years. And that would represent about 6% of our total revenues for next year, kind of again on a preliminary budget basis. So from overall ratio, we see G&A going down significantly as a percentage of total revenues, because as we’ve mentioned, we don’t see any material increase in G&A at all relative to the ARCT acquisition.
Tom Lesnick – Robert W. Baird & Co.:  Alright, great. Thank you very much. 
Operator:  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income’s earnings conference call. I will now turn the call over to Tom Lewis for concluding remarks. Please go ahead.
Tom A. Lewis: Thank you, operator and thank you everybody. It’s – with an hour on the call, a little longer than we normally do and we appreciate your patience. We look forward to getting a final and effective perspective in the near future in getting that out. We will have additional discussions on the ARCT transaction. And we’ll now focus on making the fourth another successful quarter and thank you very much for your attention. Thank you, operator.

Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator instructions) This conference is being recorded today, July 26, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.
Tom Lewis: Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our conference call where we will discuss the operations activity of the second quarter and for six months of this year. In the room with me today is Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Mike Pfeiffer, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and as always, Tere Miller, our Vice President of Corporate Communications. And then on the call with me today will be Paul Meurer, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer, and John Case, our EVP and CIO. And again, during this conference call, we will likely make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law, and the company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. But we’ll discuss in greater detail in the company’s Form 10-Q the factors that may cause such differences. And as our custom, we’ll start with Paul and you can do an overview of the numbers.
Paul Meurer: Thanks Tom. As usual, I’ll just comment on the income statement first and – providing a few highlights and then moving on to the balance sheet. Total revenue increased 13.8% for the quarter. Our revenue for the quarter was just over $115 million, or just over $460 million on an annualized basis. This obviously reflects a significant amount of new acquisitions over the past year. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by about $6.8 million in the comparative quarterly period, as that expense increases as our property portfolio, of course, continues to grow. Interest expense increased by almost $3.2 million. This increase was due to our credit facility borrowings during the quarter, as well as the June 2011 issuance of $150 million of notes and the reopening of our 2035 bonds some of which appears in this quarter and not all of which appeared in the comparative quarter last year. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remain strong with interest coverage at 3.6 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.7 times. General and administrative expenses in the second quarter were approximately $9.3 million, as compared to about $8 million a year ago. Part of this increase is due to higher unexpected costs related to our proxy process this year, about $550,000 more than we expected. Our G&A expense has also increased as our acquisition activity has increased and because we’ve added new personnel as we continue to grow the portfolio. We spent $392,000 of acquisition due diligence costs during the quarter, and our employee base has grown from 78 employees a year ago to 89 employees today. However, our current projection for total G&A for all of 2012 is approximately $35 million, which will still represent only about 7.5% of total revenues projected for the year. Property expenses were just under $2.1 million for the quarter. These are the expenses primarily associated properties available for lease. Our current estimate for property expenses for all of 2012 is about $9 million. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company, and they were just over $400,000 during the quarter. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $3.8 million. This income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We sold 14 properties during the quarter for $15 million, and a reminder again that we do not include property sales gains in our FFO or in our AFFO. Preferred stock cash dividends totaled approximately $10.5 million for the quarter, and this number obviously increased because of the issuance of our preferred F stock earlier this year. Excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed – a reminder again refers to the $3.7 million non-cash redemption charge stemming from the repayment of our outstanding 7.375% preferred B stock with some of the proceeds from our preferred F offering earlier this year. Replacement of this preferred B stock in our capital structure did save us about $1 million cash annually, obviously due to the lower coupon of the newly-issued preferred. Net income available to common stockholders was $32.95 million for the quarter. Funds from operations, or FFO per share, was $0.49 for the quarter, a 2.1% increase versus a year ago. It was $0.95 for the first 6 months of the year, but a reminder that excluding the $3.7 million preferred stock redemption charge, our FFO year-to-date would have been $0.98 per share. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash that we have available for distribution as dividends, was higher again, at $0.50 per share for the quarter, a 2% increase versus a year ago. As we mentioned recently in the last couple calls, our AFFO – we think will continue to be higher than our FFO, and we believe this differential between our FFO and a higher AFFO will continue to increase a bit. Because our capital expenditures still remain fairly low, we have minimal straight-line rent adjustments overall in the portfolio. We’ll continue to have some FAS141 non-cash reductions to FFO for in-place leases when we acquire them in large portfolio transactions. And of course, this year in 2012, we have that $3.7 million non-cash preferred redemption charge. Our 2012 AAFO earnings projection is $2.06 to $2.11 per share, or an increase of 2.5 to 5% over our 2011 AFFO per share of $2.01. We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter. We’ve increased the dividend 59 consecutive quarters and 66 times overall since we went public over 17.5 years ago. Our AAFO dividend payout ratio for the quarter and year-to-date was 87%. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we’ve continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. In May, we were very pleased to enter into a new $1 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility to replace our existing $425 million facility. This facility has a four-year initial term plus a fifth year within our control. It also has a $500 million accordion expansion feature, and the pricing is very attractive at only 125 basis points over LIBOR. We are very appreciative of the 15 bank lenders who participated in this expanded credit line which gives us tremendous flexibility with our acquisition and financing efforts. The credit facility had only $184 million of borrowings at quarter end. Our current total debt to total market capitalization is only 24%, and our preferred stock outstanding still is only 8% of our capital structure. And our only debt maturity in the next three years is a $100 million bond maturity in March of next year. In summary, we currently have excellent liquidity and our overall balance sheet remains very safe and well-positioned to support our continued growth. Now let me turn the call now back over to Tom who will give you more background.
Tom Lewis: Thanks, Paul. Let me kind of run through each piece of the business and I’ll start with the portfolio. The portfolio continued to generate very consistent cash flow during the second quarter. Generally, the tenants are doing well. There were no issues that arose with any of the tenants during the quarter, and I think at this point we’d look for that to continue herein the third quarter. So pretty much steady as she goes for portfolio operations. At the end of the quarter, our largest 15 tenants represented about 48.5% of revenue. That’s down 350 basis points from the same period a year ago and about 90 basis points from the first quarter. So this kind of accelerated acquisition activity we’ve had the last couple of years continues to help us reduce concentrations in the portfolio. Generally very healthy from an operational standpoint, to the average cash flow coverage at the store level for those top 15 tenants stayed just under 2.5 times so very, very healthy relative to the operations there. From an occupancy standpoint, we ended the second quarter at 97.3%, you saw in the release with 75 properties that’s available for lease out of the now 2,762 we own. That’s up about 70 basis points from the first quarter and just about flat unchanged from a year ago. During the quarter, we had only 6 new vacancies in the portfolio. We leased or sold 21 vacant properties during the quarter. And I really have to say our portfolio management department and the leasing people did an outstanding job and have kind of gotten ahead what we’ve asked them to do this year, which is quite positive. In addition to that, we acquired 145 properties and that’s the reason for the change in the numbers. I mentioned last quarter I thought we’d see a, I think, 30-basis-point jump in occupancy for the quarter, and very pleased that it came in higher than that. I’ve mentioned this the last couple quarters and now I’ll do it much quicker than I used to. But there are three ways to calculate occupancy. The first is physical, which is taking the number of vacant properties 75 and divide it by the 2,762 total, and that’s the one we publish in the press release that gets us to 2.7% vacancy and 97.3 in occupancy. A second way is to take the vacant square footage in the portfolio and divide it by total square footage. If you run it that way, we get 2.3% vacancy and 97.7% occupancy, a little higher. And then the third way to do it is pretty much economic, which is take the previous rent on vacant properties and you can divide that by the sum of that number and the rent paid on the occupied properties and then you can run it in dollar terms. And if you use that methodology, vacancy is only about 2% and occupancy at 98%. Obviously, any of the three represent high occupancy and we’ll mention each as we do these quarterly calls in the future. Same-store rents on the portfolio decreased 1.1% during the second quarter and also year-to-date, excluding the impact of some rent reductions which was done in the reorganizations of Buffet’s and Friendly’s. It was a same-store rent increase of about 1.1%, so you can see the impact and where that came from during the quarter. It’s likely the impact from both of those tenants will probably stay in the same-store rent number through the end of the year and then we’ll have been through the 4 quarters since that was undertaken, and it’s likely then same-store rent will turn positive as we get early in the next year. If you look where same-store rent and declines came from, 6 industries had declining same-store rent, which would be auto service, auto tire, bookstores, I think of which we have one, craft and novelties and office supplies. But really, the vast majority of it came from casual dining, which is where we have Buffet’s and Friendly’s, and that was about $1.9 million. There were three industries that had flat same-store rents, equipment services, shoe stores and transportation and then 22 of our industries saw same-store rent increases, with only a couple that have larger numbers, sporting goods, health and fitness and quick-service restaurant, and then the balance was really spread out amongst a lot of different industries. And if you put the 22 industries together, they had an increase of about 1 million for a net decline between all three of down one. And the percentages, as I said earlier, are pretty much the same whether you’re looking at the quarterly or year-to-date. And we remain well-diversified, being up to 2,762 properties. That’s up 131 properties from last quarter. And they’re in 38 different industries with 136 significant tenants in 49 states. We continue to work down our industry exposures. Convenience stores our largest industry, is down to 16.9%, down a little from last quarter and a couple hundred basis points from a year ago. And then restaurants if you combine both casual and quick-services is down at – now down to 13.8. It was at one time over 20%, and that’s down 80 basis points from the last quarter and just under 4%, 370 basis points from a year ago. Then it falls pretty quick to theaters which is under 10 at 9.6 and health and fitness came down at 6.9. And while those continue to be industries we like a lot and we’ll probably do some additional acquisitions there, we think we’ll be able to keep those in pretty good shape. The only other one over 5% is beverages. So we think industry standpoint in fairly good shape and the same on a tenant standpoint. You can see in the release, AMC is our largest at 5.2, LA Fitness at 5, and then everything else is under 5% today and again, the top 15 about 48. And when you get down to the 15 largest tenant about 2.2% of revenue is what they represent, and when you get 20, it gets down, which is not on that list, but it gets down about 1.8% and falls fairly quickly. So well-diversified there, and we think also from a geographic standpoint. Average remaining lease term on the portfolio remains healthy at 11.1 years. And as I started, the portfolio continues to generate very consistent revenue. Let me move on to property acquisitions, and I’ll start with an update on where we are and kind of where we see volumes going for the year. As those of you who follow us know, we normally report our acquisitions on a quarterly basis after they have closed and don’t report what is under contract since, from time to time, what is under contract doesn’t close and falls out during the due diligence process. If you recall, in our first quarter call we mentioned that, first of all, that we thought we would acquire around 650 million in acquisitions this year, given what market conditions looked like and what we were seeing in volume. And then secondly, we said we had previously disclosed in an offering document that we did earlier this year for a preferred offering that we had 514 million under contract for acquisitions at that time. And the reason we disclosed what was under contract, the 514 million, was really twofold. Primary was it’s a fairly large number and we thought, secondarily, in light of doing the preferred offering, that that was good disclosure, but not our normal disclosure. During the second quarter, we closed on 198 million of that 514 million, and another 13 million or so for total acquisitions of just over 210 million. The remaining 316 million in acquisitions under contract we terminated during the due diligence process and will not close, and that puts us at 221 million in acquisitions as of the end of the second quarter. So we wish more of it had closed, but 221 million is where we ended at the end of the quarter. Relative to where we see things going from here, we remained very active on the acquisition’s front and continue to believe we will be still meet the 650 million in acquisitions for the year, and that there is a very good chance we’ll end up exceeding that number. And obviously, most of that will now close in the third quarter where we are today, and in the fourth quarter. And while it will be very helpful for our 2013 numbers, the impact on 2012 AFFO will be modest. And that was the reason for the $0.02 adjustment to our FFO and AFFO guidance. I still think we’ll acquire 650 million or maybe even better now for the year, but obviously, the timing of when we do that is what impacts the 2012 numbers. Interestingly, had we closed on the 316 million, we would likely be guiding to around 1 billion again this year in acquisitions, and I only point that out to say that as I’ve talked about for a long time when working on these larger transactions which we tend to do, it can cause acquisitions to be very lumpy and hard to predict on a quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year basis. And anyway, John, why don’t you spend some time and make some comments relative to the activity we did and kind of what you’re seeing out there.
John Case: Sure. The second quarter was fairly active for acquisitions. As Tom said, we acquired 145 properties for approximately 211 million at an average cap rate of 7.1% and an average lease term of 15 years. The credit profile of the tenants we added was pretty attractive. 98% of the acquisitions or leased – tenants with investment-grade credit ratings. The acquisitions were leased to five tenants in five separate industries. Four of the five tenants were existing tenants of ours. These tenants operate predominantly in the general merchandise, drug store and transportation services industries. The acquisitions were geographically diversified, located in 28 states and 95% of our acquisitions activity was comprised of our traditional retail assets. That brings us to 147 properties acquired for 222 million for the first two quarters of the year at an average cap rate of 7.2% and an average lease term of 15 years. Let me spend a second talking about acquisition yields and investment spreads. Acquisition yields have continued to come down a bit and there are two principal reasons for this. The first is cap rates are coming down as interest rates and investment yields in general continue to decline. A second reason is we’ve acquired a much higher percentage of our properties with investment-grade tenants, which offer lower yields than we had previously. 90% of the assets we have acquired during the first and second quarters are leased to investment-grade tenants. So, we have continued to improve the credit profile of our tenant base, but we have sacrificed some yield to do so. However, our investment spreads, the spread between our initial yields and our nominal cost of equity, defined as our FFO yield adjusted for issuance cost, have continued to be very attractive relative to where they have been historically. Our year-to-date average cap rate of 7.2% represents more than a 200 basis point spread to our nominal cost of equity at the end of the second quarter. This compares favorably to our average spread of 110 basis points over the previous 17 years, especially when you factor in that we acquired assets leased to investment-grade tenants in only two of those years; 2010 and 2011. Our 2011 investment spread was 170 basis points when 40% of our acquisitions were with investment-grade tenants. So, we have been able to improve our investment spreads while moving up the credit curve this year, with 90% of our acquisitions leased to investment-grade tenants. When compared to our current weighted average cost of capital, factoring in the cost of our debt, our investment spreads are, of course, a bit higher, 230 basis points this year above our weighted average cost of capital. As you know, we also track our cap rates relative to the 10-year treasury yields, and since our IPO, you’ve heard me say this before, since our IPO in 1994, our cap rates have averaged 475 basis points over the corresponding 10-year treasury yields. In 2011, our cap rates averaged 500 basis points over the 10-year treasury yield. This year, our cap rates have averaged approximately 575 basis points over the 10-year treasury yield. So we believe this is a great time for us to acquire at very attractive spreads while enhancing the credit profile of our tenant base. Transaction flow continues to be strong. We remain comfortable, as Tom said, with our acquisitions guidance of 650 million for 2012. We’ve sourced 8 billion in acquisition opportunities through the end of the second quarter this year. As you recall, we sourced 13 billion in acquisition opportunities in 2011 and ended up closing 1 billion of those acquisitions. Retail and distribution properties continue to account for the majority of what we’re seeing, and approximately 50% of these sourced acquisitions have been properties leased to investment grade tenants. We’re continuing to pursue a number of these opportunities and anticipate an active second half of the year as far as acquisitions goes. We’re still seeing competition from property portfolios from multiple sources with a lot of capital. This is not new. We should remain competitive in the marketplace, though. This competition should continue to put some pressure on investment yields, though. In our last call, you may recall we stated that we expected cap rates to average 7.5% – 7.75% for the year. We now expect our initial yields or cap rates for 2012 to average just a shade less than 7.5%. Of course, this will ultimately be a function of the mix between investment grade and non-investment grade properties we acquire for the balance of the year. So we believe our investment spreads will continue to hold up well in this environment and should exceed the spreads we have achieved historically, even as we acquire properties leased to higher credit tenants. Tom?
Tom Lewis: Thank you. Obviously, it’s very nice to see a large transaction flow and continue to think that we’ll acquire what our targets have been or more, but do wish that all of the properties under contract would have closed. We think acquisitions is going to continue to play a big role, obviously, first in continuing to grow our revenue in AFFO which is what really drives our dividend increases. And then secondly and equally important to us right now in adjusting really the makeup of the portfolio where we’re trying to more sharply define where we want to be when we’re in retail, and then also as we move outside of retail and importantly, as John mentioned, up the credit curve. Let me move on. Relative to the balance sheet, just quickly, with access to capital we’re in very good shape, as Paul mentioned. Plenty of dry powder to execute on the acquisitions and the new $1 billion credit facility is very helpful in that light. Looking at permanent capital, obviously where our share price is trading is attractive, as is – the debt markets are very attractive and as is preferred, and as we acquire additional properties and the balance builds on the facility, we look to enter the capital markets and take advantage of that at some time. But for now, only about 18% of that facility is drawn. On earnings and guidance, we’re looking – as the release says – for 2.00 to 2.04 per share and FFO that includes the $0.03 of non-cash charge from the preferred. And then AFFO of 2.06 to 2.11 and that’s 2.5% to 5% growth. And that number really is our primary focus as it best really represents the recurring cash flow that we use to pay dividends. And speaking of dividends, we do remain optimistic that our activities will support continued dividend increases. As most of you know, we’ve historically raised the dividend in fairly equal amount each quarter and then looked in our August board meeting to see if a fifth larger increase in the dividend is warranted to keep our payout ratio kind of in the 85% to 87% range, which is where we’re comfortable, of AFFO. And our AFFO payout ratio is in that range now and continues to grow, and the board will have that discussion on an additional larger dividend increase in our board meeting next month. And I think that pretty much does it, and why don’t we – Liz, if we could open up the questions at this time, that’d be great.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of RJ Milligan with Raymond James & Associates. Please go ahead.
RJ Milligan – Raymond James & Associates: Good afternoon, guys. Tom, you often run through the acquisition funnel in terms of deals that come in through the door versus the number that you actually close on. And I know we don’t often hear about deals that are under contract that get terminated. I’m just wondering what percentage of the deals that do get under contract end up getting terminated through the due diligence process?
Tom Lewis: It’s very spotty and most of the properties that we put under contract generally do close but occasionally fall out. And it’s hard just to put a percentage on it. This obviously was one large one, but it does happen and kind of trickles through the year. And usually what it is, is you’ll go through the approval of the tenant, you do the site checks, you do most of the work, and then what happens as you put it under contract and do a lot of the final work – if it falls out, it’s usually either title issues or something with the property condition. Occasionally you can find out that there’s some planned condemnations or there’s some termination rights or something you know right around the lease. Obviously environmental – that happens from time to time. And then a few times for us over the years – since we do a lot of work in larger transactions where the real estate is just one piece of the financing package for an acquisition of an entity, it can fall out by one or more pieces of that doing it. And if you look at a typical year, it’ll be a few properties here and there, and with this one, it was a larger transaction that we worked on with a number of parties and everybody was moving forward and then the decision was made to pull it pretty late in the diligence. So it’s hard to see, “Gee, the number under contract is 100 and generally close 92.6.” It’ll be – we’ll close it all one year, close it all the next year, close 95 one year and then in a situation like this, in a big chunk, it’s hard to tell.
RJ Milligan – Raymond James & Associates: And of the 316 that was terminated, does that – is that mostly an existing tenant or is this a new tenant?
Tom Lewis: It was an existing tenant, I believe, but we had a small position with them.
RJ Milligan – Raymond James & Associates: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: Hi. Good afternoon.
Tom Lewis: Hi, Josh.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: Tom, you mentioned the growth outlook for the back half of the year. You’re still pretty confident to get to 600 million to 650 million of acquisitions. I’m just wondering how much of that is dependent on, I guess, an LBO or an M&A sort of outlook, or is that just people who are trying to modify existing real estate today?
Tom Lewis: It’s pretty granular. Isn’t it, John?
John Case: Yes. It’s a little of both, but it’s well-diversified. As usual, the ultimate number will depend on our success on some of the larger portfolios. But I would say there’s some emanating from private equity-generated acquisition opportunities, some we’re working on directly with private developers, and some we’re working directly on with tenants. So it’s really – when I look at the pipeline, it’s not concentrated in one single area. Does that help?
Tom Lewis: Yes. Last year, as you recall – and John, you can help me with the numbers – we bought a billion and there were 3 large transactions that, if you totaled them up, they were...
John Case: Yes, 850 million...
Tom Lewis: Yes. And so...
John Case: Three large portfolio transactions.
Tom Lewis: It was very concentrated last year. And as I look down the list of what we’re looking at, it seems to be in a lot more transactions than it was last year, although some number decent size.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Tom, you mentioned before about some of the releasing gains that were done in the quarter. What’s roughly the split in occupancy gains between releasing and acquisition?
Tom Lewis: Gosh, I’m sorry. I’d have to sit down and do the math. But I think if you look at this, we leased or sold – I think it was...
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: 20-plus?
John Case: And then we bought 140...
Tom Lewis: 140, but that’s on a base of 2,600 already. So I would think – and this is top of my head. I’d have to grab a calculator. Maybe two-thirds really came from leasing.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. That sounds fair. Last question. You guys were mentioning your typical spread on cap rates versus your cost of capital. How do you think about your equity cost of capital today, I guess, given the dividend yield and given the fantastic run the shares have had over the last five years?
Tom Lewis: Yes. As we always say when we discuss equity cost of capital, we realize it’s as much a philosophical and religious discussion as it is a financial one. But what we try and do, first of all, is – we’re in a business kind of like a bank where you’re working on spread and you need to make it upfront, and so we kind of focus on a forward AFFO yield, which is obviously AFFO divided by stock price and then we’ll gross it up for issuance, and then say, “Okay. Where are we coming in over that to begin?” And we really start with equity, and that’s the number where historically it’s been about 110 basis points, and at the end of the second quarter it was about 200. And then what we do is we’ll throw in the other type of capital, which is debt, which has huge spreads today and obviously is very attractive, and then preferred, which we issued at the beginning of the year. So as I said, there’s only about 18% of the line drawn right now, but as some of these get closed in the third and fourth quarter, we’ll start thinking about which way we want to go. We’ll watch the markets at that time. But let me tell you, spreads are very large all over and we have, as you know well – I think we’ve issued equity 20 times since we became public in ‘94 and that’s been at a stock price of $19 to $34 to fund accretive acquisitions. So that’s worked out pretty well for the shareholders and we’ve kept debt today I think it’s 23.8% or 23.9% on the balance sheet, so there’s a lot of room there too. So we think that’s all very attractive right now, given where spreads are.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: Sounds good. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. With your bigger line, Tom, do you plan to clear it as often, I guess, from an equity issuance standpoint or will you maybe play a bit of the “I think interest rates are going to stay low” game?
Tom Lewis: Yes. We’ve historically, as you know, not been one to play that game. The reason for getting the bigger line is we’re working on bigger transactions. And with that said, though, it is efficient, particularly when you look at the debt markets when you issue to make sure it’s index-eligible, and so you need to do in size. I think it’s 250-plus. And also, with equity, I think we’d rather go out if we’re -even if we’re buying a lot and funding a lot, not do small offerings five times a year. It’s a little easier for, I think, the equity side of the street if you fund when you do it in bigger chunks. So we’ll probably leave a little more on the line, but that is a function of not really making a call on interest rates, but a little more comfort and availability to do transactions out there when you have a little bit on the line.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. All right. Good. Thank you. And then on the disposition front, you guys accelerated a bit in the second quarter and you had talked about how you were going to do that. You had laid out quarterly for us kind of what you were thinking. But now I’m curious as you have slowed the acquisitions a bit because, as you said, you might have been close to $1 billion of acquisitions as you slow that a bit, do you also slow the disposition process or are they really unrelated?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, those are levers we could certainly pull because you really want to start and making sure you have some good AFFO growth to grow the dividend. But with that said, it is a priority for us and we’ll think we’ll close what we probably would have last quarter, but it’ll just be later in the year. But we haven’t slowed disposition. We did five properties for 3.6 in the first quarter and then 14 for, I think, 15 million in the second. And the third quarter, I think we will do more than we did in the second and I’d like to do another 50 million or so the balance of the year. I think that’d get us to around 70 million for the year and most important the run rate up a little bit. And then in the beginning of the year, we can kind of polish off the first 100 million that we put out there. And then we’re likely just going to grab another 100 million and start off again next year. But if we could get the run rate 50 million to 100 million a year and then we can take a look at all the other levers and all the other variables and looking at the company’s cash flows and work off that. But we’re very active. There’s – right now we’re at a point where there’s 10 to 15 that are in some property – some type of closing, whether you’re just putting them under LLI or whether you’re – they’ve gone non-contingent. And then I think we’ve got 28 properties out on the market and then a good-sized group of properties behind that can go out and that’s on the 100 million. So we do intend to be active, but if I can get to a run rate of 50 million to 100 million a year at the end of the quarter. And kind of next year get into – or at the end of the year and next year get it up around 100 million, we’d be happy.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Good. Thank you. And then is Crest officially gone now or is it just irrelevant? I mean, you did mention it for the first time that I can remember in the press release and I’m assuming the properties are gone. So is it – have you done away with it?
Tom Lewis: No. It’s still just hanging out there and I think it’s got three properties in it and then two mortgages that we took back, so it’s generating some income. It just didn’t have any activity so we kind of left it out there. But actually, with the acquisition that was under contract and didn’t close, we did plan to put some properties in there and use it. It wasn’t going to be a huge number, but we will use it if we think it helps us from a diversification standpoint in doing something, but we don’t look at – for it to become active over the next quarter or so.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And then Friendly’s and Buffet’s – are we run rate at this point on those two?
Tom Lewis: Yes. I think we are on those. The leasing – I think we said that we thought the Friendly’s – we would recover about 80% and I looked this morning and we’ve updated that number. We think it’ll be a little higher – around 82. And then Buffet’s – yes, I think we had said about a 65 recovery. That’s also looking a little better just by a couple hundred basis points or so. And then the leasing in Friendly’s – we had in the model not to really lease anything this year and it’s gone faster than that. That was part of what this quarter was. And similar on Buffet’s. So I’d say run rate and just moving through and maybe a little bit above what we thought recoveries would be.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Very good. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emanuel Porchman with Citi. Please go ahead.
Emanuel Porchman – Citi: Hi, guys. Good afternoon.
Tom Lewis: Good afternoon.
Emanuel Porchman – Citi: Just had a – with the properties that you ultimately terminated the contracts on, was that purely a property characteristic or a title characteristic or the environmental issue that you talked about earlier – was there pricing involved, too?
Tom Lewis: It wasn’t – yes. It wasn’t pricing and it wasn’t one of those others; it was the overall transaction moving away from of which we part of. And I apologize. Beyond that, I can’t say much. There were a number of parties involved and our confidentiality agreement was only cleared to discuss when it closed, and since it didn’t close we’re still under it, and since we plan to do future transactions with those parties – perhaps not on these assets – I really can’t go much further. But it was the transaction itself that went away.
Emanuel Porchman – Citi: Understood. And then on last quarter’s call, you had discussed about a third of what you look at being investment-grade, and obviously you’re closing a hyper-percentage of stuff as investment-grade tenants. Is that really sort of a consistent run rate or was that simply the portfolio you were looking at the time, and how much of the 650 for the year – how much of it is going to end up being 650 as investment-grade, I guess is my question.
Tom Lewis: Great. Of course, it’s subject to what closes and doesn’t, but John, maybe you’d take a run at that.
John Case: Right. The 90% we’ve closed year to date that’s investment-grade is high. I would expect it to come down a bit based on what’s in the pipeline and what we’re working on, but it is dependent upon some of these larger portfolios – some of which are not investment-grade, some of which are investment-grade. But I would expect it to be a little higher than where it was last year at the end of the year if I had to guess, and last year...
Tom Lewis: Right now, ballpark.
John Case: Yeah. 50% or so.
Tom Lewis: Yeah. It’s hard to tell, but it is, as I said, one of the things we’re trying to do. And above and beyond just investment grade, I would say even when you get below investment grade it tends to be on average a little higher credit than it might have been in the past. And that’s intentional, too. But...
Emanuel Porchman – Citi: Perfect. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lukasik with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Paul Lukasik – Morningstar: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Just to follow-up on the investment grade question. I guess, sort of in an ideal world, five to 10 years down the road, what percentage of the portfolio would you guys like to have in the investment grade category?
John Case: Yeah. We haven’t been as exactly specific, but we’d like to move that up. And again, I’ll allude to what I just said, which is some of the things that aren’t investment-grade will be cut, and if they have very high cash flows, we’ll be happy with that. But right now, we’ve gone from zero to close to 20% in between 15 to 20 today, and in just a couple of years, and we’d be very happy five, six years down the line if that was 50% to 60%. And we think that that’s something that we’ll be very happy about down the road. There will come a point likely, but interest rates do get higher, although they could stay low for some time, and so we are really working for five, six, seven years down the road, and if it could be 50, 60, 70, that’d be just fine.
Paul Lukasik – Morningstar: Okay. Thanks. And then just curious about the timing of the acquisitions that did close in the quarter, were there early, late, middle?
John Case: Virtually all of them were at the end of the quarter.
Paul Lukasik – Morningstar: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo: Hi. Thanks, guys. Just looking at the average of investment per property in the second quarter. It looks around the 1.5 million range. Is this a reflection of the type of deals you’re looking at right now, or am I looking too much into that?
Tom Lewis: Yeah. It’s just what actually closed. And as John said, the vast majority of this quarter was in retail, and traditionally those are smaller and these were a little smaller, too. So, I don’t think it’s really anything targeted. There was just a cluster of retail with smaller stores this quarter. That’s likely to increase over the next quarter – a few quarters and be a larger number per property.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo: Have you guys talked about the tenants? Have you disclosed who the tenants are and specifically what industries within retail?
Tom Lewis: John, you talked about the industries, I think, a little earlier in the call, which was general merchandise, drug store...
John Case: And transportation services.
Tom Lewis: And then I think there was a little QSR.
John Case: Yeah. A little QSR.
Tom Lewis: And so those were the industries. But we didn’t do the tenants individually, but if you look into the top 15, you’ll see that there were some increases in some names and some that popped in for the first time.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo: Okay. Thanks. And John, the blended cap rate was 7.1. If some of these properties were going to go individually, are they going for higher or is there a portfolio premium that we should look at?
John Case: I think there is a portfolio premium today in that $100 million to $200 million range. Buyers are trying to get capital efficiently invested. When you get above 200 million, that premium goes away because there’s just a limited number of players who can execute transactions in excess of 200 million without financing contingencies. So there is a bit of a portfolio premium at that level, 150 million.
Tom Lewis: Todd, I think one’s talking cap rates, one’s talking price. I think when you do a portfolio in the 100 million to 200 million range today, it actually – you may pay a tiny bit more than you would on a one-off. Above that number, you would pay less than a one-off, and it’s not a huge spread but it’s a little bit of a spread, given the number of people out trying to put capital out in bulk.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo: Okay. That’s helpful. Thanks, Tom. And really, who – back to the disposition discussion, who are the buyers to support the volumes that go in excess of 50? If you say you’re going to shoot for 50 million to 100 million, what kind of buyers are you looking at?
Tom Lewis: To date, it has been all individual buyers. The numbers, in terms of property size, is fairly small, as you can see by how many we sold and what the value were. And there is a 1031 market again today, to some extent, because with the declining cap rates, there are some gains out there in commercial property. So some have been there. And – but that was the majority of kind of one-offs years ago. Today, it’s maybe a third 1031 and the other two-thirds are just people looking for yield. They are yield-starved out in the marketplace, and so when something comes out and has a name on it and has an attractive yield, the prices are – the cap rates are lower than we had anticipated when we started doing this. We were thinking on some of these it would be up in the 9 and 10s and it’s down into the 8s and 7s. So they’re individuals. One of the things we may do as we move along here, given that there are some people out there trying to look to put away money in little – larger pieces is we may package some up and work through a few people and look for a little more quasi-institutional buyer for some of the assets. But today it’s been all individual.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo: Okay. That’s helpful. And just lastly, I’ll just ask Paul a question. There doesn’t seem to be much change expected in the second half of the year with your property operating expense guidance. Is it fair to say you’re not expecting any new vacancies? And if that’s the case, how long a lead time do you generally get for tenants, soy if you notice when they’re moving out?
Paul Meurer: Well, as a general comment on that area, the estimate did go down. I think last quarter I estimated 9.2 million for the year. Now that estimate is closer to $9 million. The increase that we’ve had has really not been a bad debt expense; it’s been more some costs on vacant properties; insurance, legal fees, things like that. The down time – historically, we used to say six to nine months. I’d say over the past handful of years that widened, it became more nine to 12 months or sometimes more. And that has started to tighten a bit back to the more normalized run rate, which – let’s call it nine months, to kind of answer your question. So it did widen even further than that, but I think it’s been getting better and the folks in portfolio management have been able to release things a little quicker than they were, say, 18 months ago.
Tom Lewis: On the how much lead-time do we get when a tenant has a problem? We have a few properties in the portfolio that it’s a one-man show where we released and then it’s generally the rent doesn’t show up. But in the vast majority of the cases, we have large tenants. And so we’re trying to do some job of monitoring their situation. We normally do get a lead-time. Not always, but normally we’ll know 90 days ahead of time or so, and sometimes five, six months that mom’s on the roof or something’s going on. And today that – as I said earlier, there was nothing that came up during the second quarter and we don’t anticipate anything in the third quarter.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo: Okay. That’s helpful. And actually I did have one last question. If you could just address the development piece of the new properties that you purchased in the second quarter?
Tom Lewis: Yes. Of that total, about 3 million was development-oriented investments. So, very little of it.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo: These are new construction. They’re pre-leased. They’re just not cash-flowing yet?
Tom Lewis: Yes correct. And I’ll just comment on that right now. We have five properties under development and it’s not a huge amount of money, and then three re-developments. And in those, if you look at it, the total cost will be about 31 million and we’ve already funded 21 million, so there’s only about 9.8 million to be funded. And in each case, it’s a situation where we have the tenant and there is somebody building the building and we were able to go in and buy it during the construction period and it’s going to get built when the lease is already in place. So you’re not taking lease upward.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Lesnick with Robert W Baird. Please go ahead.
Tom Lesnick – Robert W Baird: Hi, guys. Just standing in real quick for Paula Poskon. Most of the other questions we had have been answered at this point, but just a quick one. How much of that occupancy increase was due to vacant properties being reclassified as held for sale?
Tom Lewis: None.
Tom Lesnick – Robert W Baird: None. Okay. That’s helpful. That’s all I got.
Tom Lewis: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A portion of the Realty Income conference call. I will now turn the call back to Tom Lewis for closing remarks.
Tom Lewis: I’d like to thank everybody for joining us, and thank you for your time. I know it’s a busy earnings season. And if not before, we’ll talk to you at the next quarter. Thank you again, Liz.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-04-26 16:30:00) =====
Executives:  Tom Lewis – CEO Paul Meurer – EVP, CFO and Treasurer John Case – EVP and Chief Investing Officer
Analysts:  Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird Todd Stender – Wells Fargo Securities Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for your questions. (Operator Instructions) Today’s conference is being recorded April 26, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead.
Tom Lewis: All right. Good afternoon, everybody and thank you, Elisa, and welcome to our call to talk about the first quarter. In the room with me is Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; John Case, our Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer and Mike Pfeiffer, our General Counsel and he is also an Executive Vice President, and Tere Miller, who is our Vice President of Corporate Communications. And, as always, during this call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail on the company’s Form 10-K the factors that may cause such differences. And with that, we’ll open it up as we usually do, going over the numbers, to Paul and he will handle that.
Paul Meurer: Thank you, Tom. As usual, I will comment briefly on our financial statements, provide a few highlights of the results for the quarter and start with the income statement. Total revenue increased 17.9% in the quarter. Our revenue for the quarter was approximately $115 million or about $450 million annualized run rate. This obviously reflects the significant amount of new acquisitions over the past year. Other income was only $255,000 for the quarter. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization increased by about $8.6 million in the comparative quarterly period. Obviously depreciation expense increased as our property portfolio continues to grow. Interest expense increased by just over $3.8 million and this increase was due primarily to the June 2011 issuance of $150 million of notes in the reopening of or 2035 bonds as well as credit facility borrowings during the quarter. On a related note, our coverage ratios both remains strong with interest coverage at 3.5 times and fixed charge coverage is at 2.7 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the first quarter was $9.2 million. Our G&A expense has increased a bit as our acquisition activity has increased and we invested this past year in new personnel for future growth. G&A also includes the expensing of additional due diligence costs on the acquisition side, which totaled $242,000 during the quarter. Our current projection for G&A for all of 2012 is approximately $34 million, which will represent only about 7.25% of total revenue projected for the year. Property expenses were $2.5 million for the quarter. These expenses are primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance and insurance expenses which we are responsible for on properties available for lease. Our current estimate for property expenses for all of 2012 is about $9.4 million. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various state company and there were $405,000, during the quarter. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $851,000 million and this income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We did sell five properties during the quarter, a reminder again that we do not include these property sales gains in our FFO or AFFO. Preferred stock cash totaled $9. 5 million for the quarter and this increase reflects our issuance of 6 and 5.8% preferred F stock this year. Excess of redemption value over carrying value of preferred shares redeemed, refers to the $3.7 million non-cash redemption charges stemming from the repayment of our outstanding 7.38% preferred D stock from some of the proceeds from our preferred F offering this year. Replacement of this preferred D stock in our capital structure pays us about $1 million cash annually. Obviously, due to the lower coupon of the new preferred F stock that we just issued. Net income available to common stockholders was$26. 1 million for the quarter. Funds from operations, or FFO, per share was $0.46 for the quarter, although excluding the $3.7 million preferred stock redemption charges our FFO for the quarter would have been $0.49 or 2.1% increase over the fully $0.08 earned in the first quarter of last year. Adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividend was higher, at $0.50 per share for the quarter , an increase of 2% over $0.49 AFFO earned in the first quarter of last year. As we have always mentioned, our AFFO will continue to be higher than our FFO, and we believe this differential between our AFFO and higher FFO actually continue to increase likely. Our capital expenditures are fairly low. We have minimal straight-line rent adjustments in our portfolio. And we do believe that over time we will continue to have some FAS 141 non-cash reductions to FFO when they purchase large portfolio to have some in place leases. In addition, in 2012, of course, we will have a $3.7 million non-cash preferred redemption charge, which effects our FFO, but not in the calculation of our AFO four. Our 2012 AFFO earnings projection is $2.08 to $2.13 per share, an increase of 3.5% to 6% over our 2011 AFFO per share of $2.01.We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter. We’ve increased the dividend 58 consecutive quarters and 65 times overall since we went public over 17. Years ago. Our AFFO dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 87%. Briefly turning to the balance sheet for a moment, we believe we continue to maintain our conservative and very safe capital structure. We were very pleased to raise $409 million with our 6 5/8% class F preferred stock offerings this year, including the 1.4 million share reopening add-on offering that we did earlier this month in April. As I mentioned, the proceeds were used to redeem or higher coupon class D preferred stock and also to repay borrowings on our acquisition credit facility. So our balance sheet continues to be well positioned to support our acquisition growth. Our current debt to total market capitalization is 24% and preferred stock outstandings still represent only 8% of our capital structure. Our $425 million credit facility had just $43 million of borrowings at quarter end and of course some of that were paid off with the preferred add-on offering earlier this month in April. We have no debt maturities until 2013. So in summary, we currently have excellent liquidity and believe our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and safe. Let me turn the call back over to Tom, who will give you a little more background on the results.
Tom Lewis: Thanks, Paul, and I’ll kind of run through the various areas of the business. Let me start with the portfolio. The portfolio continued to generate very consistent revenue throughout the first quarter. And at the end of the quarter, our 15 largest tenants accounted for about 49.4% of our revenue. That’s down 440 basis points from the same period a year ago and 40 basis points from the fourth quarter, but the acquisition efforts and (inaudible) portfolio continue to reduce concentration. Relative to the health of the portfolio, the average cash flow coverage at the store level for those top 15 remains very high and very stable from previous quarters at about 2.4 times and so overall the operations of the tenants in those properties are doing pretty well. We ended the first quarter at occupancy of 96.6%, 90 properties available for lease out of the 2,631. That’s down about 10 basis points from the fourth quarter and down about 20 basis points for the same period a year ago. During the quarter, we had 16 new vacancies in the portfolio, eight came really from buffets and friendly leases that were rejected during the reorganizations and then the balance from the normal operations portfolio, which is (inaudible). And then we also leased or sold 13 vacant properties during the quarter and that basically gives you the reason for the movement in the asset. I mentioned last quarter that we thought that we – during the first quarter, we could see another 30 basis points or sort of occupancy decline. Obviously, we were able to do better than that. And we think throughout the year, absent anything material change that the portfolio occupancy will remain very high. Our best guess will be around 97% at the end of the second quarter, third quarter maybe high 96, 97 , and then a little over 97% in the fourth quarter, and that’s how the things, are looking stable, and up a bit. And the formula for how we do occupancy is basically the vacant number of properties, 90, divided by the occupied total number 2631, and that gets to the 3.4% vacancy and 96.6% occupancy. As I mentioned last quarter, we also run a couple of other ways, one is to take the vacant square footage and divided by the total square footage, and that gives you a different number. That number today is vacant square footages is about 790,000 square feet, you divide that by our total of 27,377,000 square feet, that gives you 2.9% vacancy, and about 97.1% occupancy. And then in the third way we run that is to take the previous rent on vacant properties, and divide that by the sum of that number, and the rent on the occupied property. And if you run that today, the vacant property former contractual rent in the first quarter was about 2.87 million, and if you combine that with the rent on all the occupied properties, which is a 114.6, you will get 117.47 million, divide that by the 2.87 million, and essentially, you will get to on a dollar basis about 2.4% occupancy, or 97.6%. So if you look at the three ways, number of properties, 96.6 square footage, 97.1 by dollars, 97.6. And each quarter, probably we will not go through the definitions in the future, we will mention what they are utilizing each method. And in each case, I think it still represents our very good occupancy. Our same-store rents on the core portfolio decreased 1.1% during the first quarter, while fairly small, that is unusual, and it is really a function of the impact and the kind of coming to flourish in the first quarter, and reorganizations. Excluding those, same-store rent would have increased 1.1% during the quarter, that is the dead light saying, hey, it is up to the bad stuff, the good stuff look like this. And we believe that those numbers should turn positive over the next couple of quarters, and if we had to make a guess right now, the same-store rents over the course of the year, it should be flat to slightly up. If we look where really that came from, there were only three industries that had declining same-store rents, one was bookstores, we only have one bookstore, home furnishings, and then casual dining restaurants. And that includes above Buffets and the total decrease was about 2,57, 000 million of which 2 million came from the Buffets and the Friendly’s. Four industries have flat same-store rents, business services, equipment services stores and transportation, and then there were 24 industries that saw same-store rent increases with the majority coming from sporting goods, motor vehicle dealerships, health and fitness theaters, quick service restaurants and childcare. The 24 industries together that had increases was about $1.1 million and that gets you to the net decline of about $990,000. From a diversification standpoint, the portfolio continues to be well diversified. We have 200 – 2,631 properties at the end of the quarter and that’s down three from the previous quarter, 38 different industries, 137 different tenants in 49 states and we anticipate as we said, materially adding to that in the second quarter through acquisitions. Industry exposure continues to be well diversified (inaudible). Our largest industry convenience store, you can see in the release, is 17%, that’s down about 20 basis points from last quarter. And then restaurants, if you combine both casual dining and QSR, quick service restaurants, are down about 180 basis points from last quarter. QSR is actually up a bit and casual dining is where most of that drop came from. Some of it from reduced rent on the buffets and friendlies, which is really not the way we want to reduce the concentration. And then it’s really theaters to 9.7%, it’s down 10 basis points, health and fitness up 10% and 7%. And then very quickly, the only other area over 5% is beverages, which was unchanged. So we continue to try and diversify out by industry. On a tenant basis, the largest you can see there is AMC at 5.3%. (Inaudible) also over 5%, just slightly, and all of the rest of the tenants under 5% again with the 15 largest at about 49.4%. You can see when you get to the 15th largest tenant, you are down to 2.2% of revenue. When you get to number 20, by the way, it’s down to 1.5% and 10 down from there, so fairly well diversified by tenant and then lastly by geography. The average remaining lease length on the portfolio remains healthy at about 11.1 years. If we look forward to the balance of the year on the portfolio, we feel pretty good about things for the years and we think we should have a good year in operations. Friendlies releases on the 19 properties that we got back are ahead of schedule. In our model, we had assumed that the first releases would occur next year in January in the model and we leased three of those in the first quarter, have contracts out for two more and LOIs, letter of intent on five, so we think the 10 of the 19 should get done here relatively quickly and then we’ll follow on on the other ones. With buffets, we got seven back in the first quarter. One has been leased. We have LOIs on three more. So running a bit ahead of schedule there. And then third, we had assumed an assumption that tenants equal to about 5% of rent might have some issues going forward, and we’ve said that in the last couple of calls. Yeah, I’m sorry, Paul.
Paul Meurer: 2% to 3% of rent, not 5%.
Tom Lewis: Excuse me, 2% to 3% of rent, but basically our concerns there are abated, quite a bit as in talking to the tenants, they have seen that their business have improved. So a bit more positive there relating to how we do the portfolio going forward this year. I would also say that leasing and sales activities is rest in the portfolio management department is in pretty good environment right now, and overall, we think the portfolio should be pretty stable going forward. And there are no new issues that have emerged over the last quarter. So a little bit more positive comp related to the portfolio. Moving on to the property acquisitions, the first quarter was obviously quiet, but second very busy, and I’ll let John Case, our Chief investment Officer comment on acquisition.
John Case: Thanks, Tom. We remain quite active on acquisitions front, we continue to see a high volume of acquisition opportunities. While we only invested 10.7 million in the first quarter, we expect to see a very active closing calendar over the next two to three months. Our quarterly closing activities typically driven by the timing of our larger portfolio of transactions of which they were none in the first quarter of this year. As we stated in our earnings release, subsequent to the end of first quarter, we have acquired or placed under contract acquired 500 to 14 million in acquisitions, which we expect to close during the second quarter. The two large portfolios transactions are driving the bulk of these activities, these acquisitions are comprised of 250 properties, leased before in the four different industries, all of which are industries were currently invested in. Virtually, all of the acquisitions of the retail properties of about 36% our investment in our tenants, we will provide more color on these acquisitions once they close. We have seen a broad range of investment possibilities, we sourced approximately 6 billion in acquisitions opportunity so far this year. Again, this is everything that is come in the door, that acquisitions team has reviewed. This activity is comprised of 1300 properties, leased to 115 tenants, and 33 industries. The majority of what we’re seeing continue to be retail and distribution property. And about half of the properties were analyzing are released to investment-grade tenants. While we are no longer evaluating the majority of these acquisitions, we continue to pursue a number of these investments. Given our level of activity to date this year, we’re raising our acquisition estimates for 2012 of 650 million from our previously announced $500 million. We currently believe our initial cap rates should average from 7.5% to 7.75% for the year. Our initial lease terms should continue to average 15 years or longer. While the acquisition market is active, it is also competitive. So investment yields remain under pressure. Our investments spreads continue to hold up very well though. Our anticipated acquisition cap rates reflect about a 175 basis point spread over our year-to-date average nominal cost of equity. This again is taking our average price year-to-date and adjusting it for the forward FFO yield and – calculating the forward FFO yield on that and grossing it up for our equity issuance cost. This spread compares favorably to our long-term average of 110 basis points and it’s just a shade of our 2011 average spread of 170 basis points. At our current share price, our expected investment spreads are in excess of 200 basis points. Tom?
Tom Lewis: Thanks. So obviously spreads remain very, very wide even on slightly lower cap rate. Obviously we’re pleased with what plan on the second quarter with the $514 million that we’ll have coming in the door during the quarter. As John mentioned, it’s 250 properties. So it’s a lot of retail properties leased to four tenants in all industries that we are in already and then the vast majority of it is retail. The other thing is it’s very typical of what we thought over the years. It has fairly high cash flow coverages that would be in line with the balance of our larger tenants and about a third of it is investment grade. So I think normal write-up, the middle of – the middle for us in terms of what we require. Normally, we would not have announced it obviously until they closed which is what we typically do, but we needed to disclose that we did have those accusations coming in because we were doing the additional preferred offering. And those transactions, some of them are part of larger transactions that tenants are undertaking and those will transpire over the next couple of months and then we’ll comment further on those after we get them done and then the tenants are able to complete the overall transactions and then we are freed up of confidentiality agreements and be able to talk a little more about them. And we believe that all of them should close in the second quarter. There could be a little leakage into the third quarter, but obviously very positive. John mentioned, we’re using $650 million in acquisitions in our numbers for now. Transaction flow is excellent. So we could exceed that, but it really is, as we’ve said for a long time, lumpy quarter-to-quarter and highly dependent on the larger transactions closing in a competitive environment and it’s really instructive now in the first quarter, you’re looking at 10 million and in the second quarter, 514 million, that is a very good example of how it can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter and how to take what you do one quarter and then annualize that. We think the acquisitions will continue to play a big role obviously in our ability to grow the revenue, and the AFFO, which will drive dividend increases, but also really adjusting the make-up of the portfolio, where we want to move up the credit curve relating to tenant quality and then be selected in terms of retail, in what sectors we want to be in, and also outside. So if you look at the last couple of years, we have been trying to do this movement, as of the end of the second quarter that would take us for kind of 2010, 2011 and 2012 about 2.2 billion of property that we have acquired, about 1.4 billion of that has been in retail, 800 million in other areas outside of retail that we think will do well for us. And then of the 2.2 billion just under 800 million would investment-grade tenants or the subsidiaries, and these amount of the balance of the acquisitions pretty close to investment-grade, and that’s a trend that we would like to continue, but given the volumes we’re looking at now, and kind of where it is coming from the best guess this year would be a little heavy in the retail than we have in the last two years, and more to what we have traditionally done and that is just really a matter of the transaction flow that is coming across. And we will see how that goes as the year goes on. Relative to funding those acquisitions as I mentioned last quarter were all living in a very low interest rate environment, and it’s easy to get the assumption of what was being that way. And we want to make sure on the capital that we were raising that we are not really creating any near-term maturities, and that if interest rates go up in the future, we will have appropriately match funded long-term leases and long-term capital. And that’s what we have been trying to do in the last couple of years, it has been a little over 1 billion of equity, obviously, with no maturities. 150 million debt offering last year, that matures in 2035, and then the 400 million of preferred that we’ve done recently. So that’s about 1.5 billion of capital where we are making too much creating the near-term maturities. Going forward, today, and looking what we might do long-term debt, obviously looks very attractive but be nothing with the short maturity, obviously the equity is trading very well and attractive and over the next couple of months, we’ll watch the markets with what’s going on, try and make an appropriate decision relative to what type of permanent capital , we will use with these acquisitions. As mentioned in the balance sheet, and power today– continue to grow, so we feel that the capital markets are obviously open and available in a very good pricing. Let me go on to earnings and guidance. The acquisitions and high occupancy obviously had an impact on the numbers here, and will benefit us for the balance of the year. We’ve increased the guidance for 2012 depending on both ends on FFO of 202 to 206 and then on AFFO of 208 to 213, which is about 3.5% to 6% AFFO growth. As we continue to raise the monthly dividend a bit each quarter, it has been our custom every year in August that our Board Meeting to sit down and see if a fixed dividend increase is warranted each year, and now we are seeing AFFO payout ratio which falls at 87%, excuse me, and that should drop further as the year goes on when we see FFO growth. So I would anticipate that the board will meet and consider a fifth and larger increase this year, which obviously would be positive for shareholders. And with that, I think what we will do Elisa is, we will open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good afternoon.
Tom Lewis: Hi, Josh.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: I’m wondering if you guys could give a little bit more comments about your two to three year outlook on sales process. I know you noted that the sales have been kind of slow in the first quarter. But this is sort of a question within a question. A, what do you expect in the sales process over the next couple of years and B, is there some right size of the enterprise that you’d like, we’ll be able to get over the next few years, just given that you guys have gotten bigger, and probably necessitates larger deals to continue growing?
Tom Lewis: I’ll start with the last part of that. I think we will continue to get bigger, notwithstanding sales because the acquisitions will outstrip them, and fortunately we have been able to do more acquisitions as the market has been, there has been at lot of product on the market. We have been very active and with good spreads and cost of capital, it’s really an nice window here to jump through, but size over time, is certainly an issue down the road. Relative to sales, talked to linked again in the last two about kind of re-rating the whole portfolio and starting to sell off some things that we don’t want to hold over the long term, and we targeted initially 106 properties out of the portfolio, a fairly small was about 114 million and asset size and really just stack that really and additional departments to do that in January and started the process, obviously these are aren’t like selling securities where you can push a button. They do take some time, but I think that initial 114 will take the balance of this year, and probably into the first quarter of next year and than what we will do is, we will probably just have another 100, 150 right behind that that we try and do over a year. So if I could targeted run rate once we get up and operating here, it will be $100 million, give or take $25 million, $50 million on each side. And that should be something that should continue, I would think, for the next three, four years based on how we’ve analyzed the portfolio. If you look at the 106 that we targeted, again, really (inaudible) in January, there is 49 of those right now where we’re out talking to brokers in the communities where those properties are and going through due diligence, getting the broker opinion of value and coming to some agreement with the person who’ll use. We have another 24 that are listed on the market right now and available. There are 13 that we had on the market that have letters of intents and then two under contract and we closed one. And then there is another 17 or so that we need to initiate. So I think we are off to a good start, but it will take a couple of quarters to get it going, we should start seeing sales ramp up, a little bit in the second quarter and then in the third and fourth, I would hope that it becomes very, very active, but we’re up and running there. If I had to guess, it would be $100 million give or take that we’re selling each year.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: That’s very helpful. One last question. Have you seen the high yield market, which has been, as you know, very strong this year, has that been impacting tenant decisions on whether to go with the triple net financing or have you seen – it sounds like the deal flow this year has been pretty good. Has the high yield market been impacting that either positively or negatively?
Tom Lewis: The high yield market is on fire and that does give an alternative to tenants, but they’ve also realized that net lease is permanent financing, and we are very low interest rates and I think that some people have sat down, really thought their way through it and said, look, we have these properties on the books, let’s go out and get some very long-term financing, which I think is smart for them to do. John, you want to comment?
John Case: I can think of just a couple of transactions involving private equity firms where they opted to pursue more high yield financing than sale leaseback financing over the last three to four months. It hasn’t really been a significant impact on our business, but we’re seeing a little of it given the strength of that market right now.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: Right. So for the triple nets, you don’t get (inaudible) at the last moment?
Tom Lewis: We try very hard to make that point when we’re doing a transaction.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks very much. Good luck.
Tom Lewis: You bet
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paula Poskon with Robert W Baird. Please go ahead.
Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.
Tom Lewis: Hi, Paula.
Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird: Tom, you described the transaction flow as excellent. Does that reflect just the velocity of opportunities that you’re seeing or does that reflect the suitability of the opportunities relative to your acquisition criteria?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, I think it is, as John mentioned, that in (inaudible) acquisitions this year, about $6 billion had come in the door and for the whole year, last year, if I recall, it was about $13 billion, and then we’ll use last year numbers. Of the $13 billion, about $8 billion gets seriously analyzed and then about $3 billion goes into committee and we actually had a very high hit rate last year though we bought $1 billion. So looking at six and closing about 500 million, the numbers in terms of are pretty high and then the suitability is also very high. And a good part of it a good percentage, again, is investment grade that we’re looking at.
Tom Lewis: Yeah, about half of what we are seeing is investment grade, and what we’re invested in projected to invest in, it’s about 36%.
John Case: And it’s also across a lot of different industries and that tells us sometimes there is something going on in convenience stores or restaurants where those industries don’t have capital or there is a lot of M&A and that’s really what causes people to come into the market, but today it’s pretty broad-based across industries, which tells us, people saying, hey this is a good time while interest rates are low to go out and do something, and I think they are right and then conversely this for us too given where spreads are and we can get long-term financing.
Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird: And what are some of the industries that you’d like to be in that you are not currently?
Tom Lewis: Well, in retail, we kind of got fully funded and if there you just kind of say anything in there that is non-discretionary to meddle up our income we love, and in retail if it’s going to be the kind of lower income, better be value, club stores, dollar stores, or along those lines. And then outside, it’s really kind of the Fortune 1000, we’re trying to fall in a little bit and look into those industries that’s cannot be as capital intensive and we would benefit from some of the trends going on conversely, in retail like in when the Internet retailing and transportation, we are looking in that area and we’ve been we’ve done some business with FedEx and looking at some others and so it’s kind of up the credit curve outside of retail and non-heavy equipment type businesses, service business or really Fortune 1000 type companies.
Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird: That’s really helpful. And then finally, one last question, what do you think the spread is in the cap rate between what you are buying and selling at?
Tom Lewis: That’s a very interesting question. We had targeted for our modeling selling at a 10 cap and we had probably bought those assets at 8 and today they are yielding us – happen to yield us 883, those we want to sell on the sales. We only have one sale but in through looking at the LOIs and others, it’s down closer to where the cap rate spread is, it’s pretty tight I think in the four or five to date is about 9. So I think we’re going to have a better range of cap rates and some are lower than what we’re holding at so we’re doing pretty good. If you look today, it’s hard to really say, here’s what we’re buying, here is what we’re selling, we’re selling generally those tenants that we think that might be challenged in the future or in industries that we like to move away from, and we’re buying going up the credit curve, so there should be a spread there is any type of credit spreads that go on in that lease business?
Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird: And I’m sorry, one last question, this is really big picture. As you sort of think about long-term really long-term about the trends of consumer spending patterns and what not, is there anything kind of emerging to you of where you definitely want to be or don’t want to be and sort of using that this next generation coming out where I’d be long (inaudible).
Tom Lewis: Right. Yeah. Very much so and will do have some very strong feelings about that, and it’s a function that we think A, retail will be tougher and then secondly, the interest rates will be something that comes in as a problem in the future. And we – it’s interesting, we kind of thought that recession was coming. We’re doing a big picture dive relative to where we were and where we kind of missed it for a couple of years in the last couple, it’s really come up front for us is dividing the consumer up to upper income, middle income and lower income and then looking at discretionary versus non-discretionary items. And saying in the upper income, you can do both the discretionary and non-discretionary, we will do very well with that money. And then when you get into middle income, it’s a little bit of a shrinking group, so you want to say with non-discretionary things, they have to buy and when you are looking at discretionary be careful. And then in the lower income, it’s a really tough going forward. Credit is tough, it’s a lot of people out of work and it’s not improving rapidly and we think we are discretionary spending, it’s going to be huge problem and so we don’t want anything that we view as discretionary spending of the low-income consumer. We made some significant investments in restaurants in 2007 and 2008, and I wish we would have looked at what we thought would be was going to happen with the economy and tied it to the consumer a couple of years earlier because a lot of that was casual dining and comes right down to the low end consumer on discretionary spending, and that’s really kind of where we don’t want to be and in retail, we want to make sure, it’s primarily the middle income, upper income consumer and then we can play in both discretionary, and non-discretionary. So if you did that and I will give you an examples, if consumer discretionary, it’s the middle and upper income, health and fitness, theatres, supplies, that was pretty good and you have to watch where you’re buying from a demographics standpoint. If it’s consumer non-discretionary kind of at the middle take, auto collision, auto service, tires, sea stores, drug stores, those look fairly attractive to us. And then kind for all demographics, those retailers could have good value propositions as kind of whole sale clothes, dollar stores, discount, volume retailers. And then, to couple it given where we think the fixed rates might go in the future by trying to go a bit up the credit curve.
Paula Poskon – Robert W Baird: That’s very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo Securities: Hi. Thanks, guys. Tom, just circling back to your comments on the disposition, the real opportunity for you to sell properties on a one-off basis, I know it might be a little more time consuming, but you get that tend you really want to exchange buyer, it might not be as price sensitive, and if an urgency to close. Any color on the – if these are going to be portfolios group or maybe just the one-off?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, we will do a few – in pieces, but I think, we’ll come with the conclusion the best buyer for the – their good locations, is to the buyer in the community where the property exists, because these tend to be on main drag, people know them if they go buy, and they’re comfortable with their community and they’re comfortable with that location in their community, and that’s sold by I think the local brokering there. And since they’re fairly small asset size, they fit kind of that type of buyer. With that said, along the way, we’re getting a few calls where somebody says, we would like to do four or five. What we learned in crust though, over a number of years, if you get people coming and try and tie up four or five, and then try and work the transaction, it’s got one out here and one in there, and we’ve just been better off, unless you’re really going to discount them and do a good volume block, you will get maximum value, kind of one-off. And that is a system that we’re trying to build, as we do the sales.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo Securities: That’s helpful. And then, just a couple with that. Any geographic pockets that concern you, maybe some macro issues related to the housing market not coming back that are skewing you to sell more across the country?
Tom Lewis: That’s a great question and I have to say, a soft. No, there are some areas that are little less attractive, but we did a really interesting study, we went and studied all of the tenants last year and the industries, and we rate them, and it took a year. We undertook the same project with properties and started defining real estate characteristics to them relative to income, population, demographics, and really going through the portfolio and when it was done weighted and weighted the properties from real estate characteristics, then they could marry to the credit statistics of the tenant. And we thought it’ll be interesting the back cast was real estate characteristics. So we basically took the last couple of three bankruptcies the company have had, we took both properties and rated, and the correlation to whether we got the properties back, or they were successful is almost zero. The co-relation was almost cash flow coverage, and then there was the rating for consumer discretionary as the consumer. So we’re more focused in that area because when we backed up, it was stunting to me that you take – you’re looking at traffic flows, the traffic demographics and all the other things, and all that really matter with the cash flow coverage.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo Securities: That’s helpful. Thanks, Tom. And last question, with the new acquisition you announced the pending one that’s going to close in the second quarter. Is there any secured debt that comes along with that?
Paul Meurer: No, there is none on this one.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Yeah, hello, guys. Good afternoon.
Tom Lewis: Hi, Rich.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Staying with that last question for a second. Your acquisition facility, I assume it is at about zero I think, how you’re basically saying and as you add these acquisitions this quarter, that’s going to pretty much match you out. Is that about right?
Paul Meurer: Yeah, and so obviously options include the utilizing the accordion on the facility, which has $200 million that can be added to the $425 million or access in permanent capital, which whether be common preferred or bonds or all, very available at the moment and very well priced.
Tom Lewis: I’ll also say add-on to that that we have a fabulous group of banks that we have a great relationship with and have been told over time that it’s an environment where pick up the phone if you need something. So we don’t have a concern in that area.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Tom, your confidence level, I take it is high that you closed on these. So you could say you were going to equity, you could do that really at any point, right?
Tom Lewis: You could, but we have found that the best ideas to match those things up while we think there is a very, very high chance that they’re closing, given where we are on them. We generally like to make sure they are going to close and close them before we got a lot of money.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. That sounds pretty intelligent. When you look at Friendly’s and Buffets, is there any more impact in the second quarter and what do you think happened beyond 2Q?
Tom Lewis: I think the impact lags throughout the year. I think same-store rents will be a little soft in the second quarter and gets a little better in the third and fourth. And I think the leasing happens over time, and obviously since we are comping off last year’s number pre-bankruptcy on both of these and some of the concessions we made on a comp basis, those will show up this year. But in terms of handling it, I’d say it gets done in the first three quarters. I think most of it could do and I know our portfolio management group is listening and now knows what we need to do. And then that will pretty much in and we’ll look forward from there. And as I mentioned earlier, there is nothing that’s jumped up we see as of right now in the portfolio above or beyond those.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thanks. And one more thing. It looked like you – you added two stores in the quarter and it looked like you added one retail chain. And I was curious, two things, one what the retail chain was, and why you would add one store of one new retail chain?
Tom Lewis: The retail chain increases were released of a property.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, I got you.
Tom Lewis: As part of the acquisition efforts. We agree, relative to the acquisition front, for the most part, you’re not going to see that sort of situation.
John Case: I was just going to say that I don’t know.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Yes, exactly. Okay, good, very good. Thank you guys.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer portion of the Realty Income’s conference call. I will now turn the call over to Tom Lewis for closing remarks.
Tom Lewis: Thank you. As always, we appreciate everybody’s time and look forward to talking to you again in any upcoming (inaudible) or other meetings and other than that, we’ll talk to you in about 90 days. Thank you and Elisa, thank you for your help.

Presentation: 
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today February 9, 2012. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host for today Mr. Tom Lewis, CEO or Realty. Please go ahead.
Tom Lewis: Thank you, Joe. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our conference call. We will go throw the operations and results for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. In the room with me as usually is Gary Malino, our President Chief Operating Officer, Paul Meurer, our EVP and CFO, John Case, our EVP and Chief Investment Office and Mike Pfeiffer, our EVP and General Counsel and Terry Miller, our Vice President Corporate Communications. And as always during this call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. Company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in the forward-looking statements and we will disclose in greater detail in the company’s Form 10-Q, the factors that could cause those differences. And we will start as we always do with the numbers Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Tom. So as usual, I will provide some brief comments on our financial statements and provide some highlights of the financial results for both the quarter and the year starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 23.6% for the quarter and 22.6% for the year. Our revenue for the quarter was $114 million or approximately $456 million on an annualized basis. This obviously reflects the significant amount of new acquisitions over the past year and positive same store rent in our portfolio increases per year of 1.3%. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by about $9.5 million in the comparative quarterly period as depreciation expense increased obviously as our property portfolio continue to grow. Interest expense increased by just under $3.9 million and this increase was due primarily to the June issuance of $150 million of notes in the reopening of our 2035 bond, as well as the $237 million of credit facility borrowings, which we had at year end. On a related note, our coverage ratios do remain strong with interest coverage at 3.5 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.9 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the fourth quarter were $7.95 million or 7% of total revenues. Our G&A expense has increased as our acquisition activity has increased. And we invested in some new personnel for future growth. G&A was also impacted by the expensing of acquisition to diligent cost $357,000 during the quarter and a total of $1.5 million in expense during the year. Our current projection for G&A for 2012 is approximately $33 million, which will continue to present only 7% of total revenue. Property expenses were $2.3 million for the quarter and $7.4 million for the year. These in course of the expenses primarily associated with the tax of maintenance and insurance one properties where we are responsible for those expenses and properties available for lease. Our current estimate for 2012 is similar at about $7.5 million. Income tax consistent income tax paid to various dates by the company there were $367,000 during the quarter. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $1 million and this income is associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. We did sell five properties resulted in a gain on sales of $1.2 million during the quarter and a reminder that we do not include these property sales gains in our AFFO or in our FFO. Preferred stock cash dividend remained at $6.1 million for the quarter and net income available to common stock holders increased to approximately $34.9 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO per share increased 8.5% to $0.51 for the quarter and 8.2% to $1.98 for a year. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO are also bad but the extra cash we had available for distribution and dividend was higher, higher than FFO and it increased 8.3% to $0.52 for the quarter and 8.1% to $2.01 per share for the year. Our AFFO will continue to be higher than our FFO and its differential between our AFFO and FFO will continue to increase. Our capital expenditures are fairly low, we have minimum straight line rent in our portfolio and we believe we will continue to have some FAS141 non-cash reductions to FFO due to in place leases that we acquire in large portfolio transactions that we do. In addition, in 2012 we will have a $3.7 million non-cash charge to FFO for the redemption of our preferred D stock representing approximately $0.027 per share in FFO. Our 2012 AFFO earnings projection is $2.07 and $2.12 per share or an increase of 3% to 5.5% over our 2011 AFFO per share of $2.01. We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter we have increased dividend 57 consecutive quarters and 64 times overall since we went public over 17 years ago. And of course as we announced this week we have not declared 500 consecutive monthly dividends over the past 42 years. Our dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 85% of our funds from operations and about 84% of our AFFO. Briefly turning to the balance sheet we have continued to maintain a conservative and very safe capital structure. This week we closed on our recent preferred stock offering, which raised over $373 million in gross proceeds at a coupon rate of 6 5/8%. We were very pleased with the strong investor demand in the offering and we very much appreciate the underwriters who supported us and did a terrific job on this offering. User proceeds will be to repay our outstanding 7 3/8% class D preferred stock, which will save us $1 million cash expense annually and also to pay off all of our acquisition credit facility borrowing. Our balance sheet continues to be well positioned to support our acquisition growth. Our current debt to total market capitalization now is only 25% and our preferred stock outstanding still represents only 8% of our capital structure. Our $425 million credit facility did have $237 million of borrowings at year end. But as I mentioned we used the preferred proceeds this week to pay off all of those borrowings on the facility. We had no debt maturities until 2013. So in summary, we currently have excellent liquidity and our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and stable. Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom who will give you a little bit more background on these results.
Tom Lewis: Great, I will start with the portfolio. During the fourth quarter the portfolio continue to generate very consistent cash flow. At the end of the quarter our largest 15 tenants accounted for about 49.8% of our revenue that’s down 480 basis points from the same period a year ago and 220 basis points from the third quarter. So our acquisition efforts continue to help us reduce our concentrations in the portfolio getting that down to 49.8. The average cash flow coverage at the store level for those top 15 tenants, which we mentioned each time was right at 242 times so very healthy. We ended the fourth quarter with 96.7% occupancy and 87 properties available for lease out of the 2634 in the portfolio that is down about 100 basis points from the third quarter and up about 10 basis points for the same period a year ago. During the quarter, we had 43 new vacancies 25 of those came from expirations at the end of the lease and that is a little higher number than usual but occasionally with the expirations it gets a little bit lumpy and that was the case in the quarter. We also had 18, which were defaults primarily related to Friendly’s we also leased or sold 15 properties during the quarter and also added properties portfolio, which is how you get to the 96.7% number. If we look forward into the first quarter I think it was about phase filing and as we begin leasing the properties up that they are on the vacancy list we could see another 20 or 30 basis points decline in occupancy down to around 96.5 or 96.4% is the best estimate right now. And then we would anticipate that we would see occupancy increasing from there over the next few quarters as we really generate more leasing activity on these. Let me take a moment and kind of walk through how we calculate occupancy and then give you some color on it. For the last 18 years or so we calculated occupancy by taking the number of vacant properties we had, which was 87 and dividing that by the number of buildings that we have in the portfolio, which was 2634 and that’s pretty simple methodology that gives us 3.3% vacancy and 96.7% occupancy. For a number of years now internally we would run occupancy a couple of other ways. Just eyeballed the numbers, other ways to take it just on a square footage basis instead of property, where we take the vacant square footage and divide it by the total square footage in the portfolio. Another way to do it is on a dollar basis, which was to take what was the previous ramp on any properties that are vacant and divide that by the sum of that number and the ramps on all of the occupied properties and that gives us to you on a dollar basis and we’ve run all three methods for quite a while and generally they would be around the same numbers as historically our building sizes and kind of rents for property overall were pretty consistent. However, in the last few years as we bought some larger properties that is skewed the numbers and we also have about 4.5% of the portfolio now in agricultural land that have no buildings on it, yet are under long-term leases. And so we are getting some variance in the three different methods of it. Somebody recently asked me when I said occupancy they said it’s physical or economic and well I don’t wasn’t quite sure what their version of economic occupancy was, we thought we would go ahead and provide all three numbers. Then again the traditional way is 87 properties vacant 2634 total and that’s a 3.3 vacancy rate and a 96.7% occupancy rate. If you do buy square footage the total vacant square footage is 746,000 square feet you divide that by the 27,369,000 square feet in the portfolio that gives us a 2.7% vacancy and 97.3% occupancy rate. And then the last way if you take the former contractual rent in the fourth quarter for the vacant property it was about 2.48 million and if you combine that and the rent on the occupied property of $113 you will get $115.78 million and then if you divided that back into the $2.48 million that will give you a vacancy of 2.1% at an occupancy of 97 9 on a dollar basis. So you can pick your own number, we will for historical continuity continue to report it on the fiscal occupancy number, but make those other numbers available and I will figure out how to get them into our reporting and then mention him on the calls if anybody wants to know what they are. Obviously all three are fairly close and represent fairly high occupancy. Same store rents on the portfolio increased 1.1% during the fourth quarter, which was in the kind of average range in our mind for the year since rents increased 3.3% taken a look at where those came from during the year, we had three of the industries declining same store rents in the portfolio book stores was one automotive services and quick service restaurant, which was fast food but it was relatively modest decline of only about 492,000 so fairly small. Two industries have flat same store rents that was drug stores and transportation services, which was fairly new to the portfolio. And then 24 industries saw some same store rent increases the majority of that kind of going from highest to lowest was increases was movie theaters, motor vehicle dealerships, casual dining restaurants, convenient stores, sporting goods, automotive tire and health and fitness. In the balance we are fairly small increase in those numbers casual dining restaurants and motor vehicle dealerships making surprising relative to a contribution for the same store rent increases. But I would note we gave a few temporary rent reductions to a few of those tenants in those industries during the recession those expired and that’ what caused the increases in those industries and it’s not a trend we would think it’s going to continue. And again the balance of the increase is fairly small increase. The 24 increase industries together had a total increase of about $4.7 million and that gets to a net gain of $4.25 million in same store rent. Diversification in the portfolio continues to widen we are in 38 industries that’s up 6 from a year ago. Concentrations in the industries continue to climb convenient stores is our largest at 17.2% that’s down 110 basis points from last quarter and we think we will continue to bring that one down. Restaurants if you combine both casual dining and the quick service are little less than last quarter now at 16.4% that’s down 90 basis points from last quarter casual dining is now under 10% at 9/8 it’s down about 110 basis points from the last quarter. Quick service, fast food was up about 20 basis points to 6.6%. The next one is Peters, which rose 9.8% as we made some acquisitions this year. Also, health and fitness was up 80 basis points to about 6.9%, both areas we continue to like and will likely add to. The only other category that’s over 5% now is beverages at 5.3%. So I think we are in very good shape relative to industry concentrations. We’ll keep them reasonable and try and continue to lower them. On a tenant basis, the largest individual tenant at 5.3% of rent is AM Peters, that’s down 10 BPs, Diageo is 5% and then everything else in the portfolio is under 5% and again when you put the 15 largest together they are just under 50%, 49.8% and then when you get back into the 15% it’s about 2.2% of rent and if you even went further to 20% it gets down to about 1.5% of rent and then goes down pretty quickly after that, so fairly well-diversified from a tenant standpoint. Geographically, we also remain well-diversified. The average lease term remaining is 11.3 years, that’s up a little bit over the quarter with recent acquisitions. We announced a couple of weeks ago that Friendly’s is back out and operating, having completed their reorganization fairly quickly and also announced Buffets is in the process and we work with their management, who we know well, very quickly to structure an agreement with them. As we said in our press release a couple of weeks ago, it is subject to court’s approval and the reorganization process which is underway. Like in the Friendly’s situation with Buffets, Mike Pfeiffer, our General Counsel co-chairs the creditor’s committee and we’re hopeful that a process can be completed expeditiously, which I think could benefit all parties involved and we can move through that one fairly quickly. Relative to a theme with those two, I think it continues to be a difficult environment for retailers that sell discretionary goods to generally lower income consumers. I think tenants, like these two in the casual dining area will generally fit into that category in our mind. And as we’ve mentioned we wouldn’t be surprised to see a little more softness with another tenant in that area and as the year goes on. Fortunately, our exposure to that area is modest and continues to climb, although we would prefer if more of that decline was generated from asset sales and investments in other areas as a way that it declines. The majority of the portfolio continues to do quite well and occupancy as I’ve mentioned is very high. We’ll move on to acquisitions now. It’s obviously a very strong year in that area and I’ll let John Case, our Chief Investment Officer to comment on activities there.
John Case: All right, Tom. We remain quite active on the acquisitions front in the fourth quarter. We acquired 39 properties for approximately $190 million. The average in this release yield on these investments was 7.5%. The average least term is just under 20 years. Properties are diversified by geography, tenant, industry and property type. They are located in seven states, 100% leased to four tenants in four different industries and represent three property types with our traditional retail investments accounting for 86% of our funds invested during the fourth quarter. 80% of the acquisitions are leased to new tenants, which further diversifies our portfolio. In the fourth quarter we closed to file $19 million of the $544 million diversified net lease portfolio or ECM transaction we announced in the first quarter of 2011. Our fourth quarter activity brought us to $1 billion…
Tom Lewis: Is that a billion?
John Case: That’s a billion, Tom.
Tom Lewis: With B?
John Case: With a B, $1 billion in property investments for 2011, the most we’ve ever completed in a single year in dollar terms. The billion for the year was comprised of 164 properties having initial average initial yield of 7.8% and an average lease term of 13.4 years. The properties are leased to 22 separate tenants and 17 different industries. We continue to be pleased with our level of acquisition activity, which really helped us drive our FFO growth in 2011. Most of you have heard Tom describe our acquisition activities lumpy before. Well, it continues to be that way. $852 million of our 2011 acquisitions came from three large portfolio transactions. The remaining $148 million of acquisitions came from single property and smaller portfolio opportunities. We generally this from quarter to quarter by just being in the marketplace and this should lead to about $100 million to $150 million of acquisitions annually. So our success on the three large portfolio has really drove our volume in 2011. On this yearend call, we usually give you an overview of the previous year’s acquisition transaction flow and provide some additional perspective. I’m going to go slowly here because there are a lot of numbers I want to share with you. In 2011, we sourced $13 billion in total acquisitions opportunities. This is everything that comes in the door, not all of it makes sense for us. So of the $13 billion sourced, our acquisitions team analyzed about $8 billion in opportunities in 2011, an increase of about 70% versus 2010. Of this amount, just under $3 billion was taken through our investment committee. The $3 billion represented 1,300 properties with 45 different tenants. Over the last 10 years our investment committee has averaged working on about $3 billion in opportunities per year, ranging from a low of $1 billion to a high of $5 billion. So 2011 was right in line with our long-term average. The $1 billion we acquired represented 33% of what our investment committee worked on and of course was a record year for acquisitions. Over the last 10 years, on average, we have acquired 15% of what our investment committee worked on. This year’s 33% figure reflects our success in closing those three large portfolio transactions. Our initial yields or cap rates have averaged 8.9% during the last 10 years, with a high of 10.4% and a low this year of 7.8%. Cap rates declined over this period as interest rates have declined and as net lease properties have become more main stream and more investors have entered the market. We have historically tracked our cap rates relative to 10-year treasury yields. Since we went public in 1994 our cap rates have averaged about 475 basis points over the corresponding 10-year treasury yields. The 2011 average 10-year treasury yield was 2.8%, so our initial yield of 7.8% was 5% over the average 10-year this past year, a bit better than our long-term average. Obviously, now with the 10-year treasury yield at 2% our cap rates are closer to 5.75% over the 10-year. Another factor impacting our cap rates is our move up the tenant credit curve the last two years. In 2011 41% of our acquisitions are with investment grade tenants. Our completion of these high credit tenant acquisitions reduced our overall initial yields by about 30 basis points to 40 basis points in 2011. However, our investment spreads remain very attractive to our long-term average and we improved our tenant credit profile. Over the last 17 years our acquisition cap rate spread over our nominal cost of equity has averaged about 110 basis points. We calculate our nominal cost of equity by taking our forward FFO yield and grossing it up for issuance costs. Last year that spread was approximately 170 basis points. As we have moved into 2012 our acquisitions transaction flow has continued to be quite active consistent with the volume of opportunities we were seeing in 2011. Sellers were motivated by the significant liquidity in the net lease market. Continued private equity and M&A activity are also leading to sale lease back opportunities. The flow is fairly evenly divided between investment grade and non-investment grade opportunities and the majority of it is in our traditional retail properties but we are seeing possibilities in all of our property types. There continues to be significant competition for property portfolios but we should continue to be competitive in the marketplace. Cap rates are turning down slightly from where they were in the second half of 2011 as interest rates have declined a bit. Cap rates generally range from the low 7% area to the high 7% area for investment grade tenants and from the high 7% area to the high 8% area for non-investment grade tenants. We currently anticipate our initial yields on acquisitions for 2012 to average around 7.75%. Tom?
Tom Lewis: John’s promise still average 7.75%.
John Case: Yeah.
Tom Lewis: Thanks. Obviously we’re pleased with the results for 2011 in acquisitions and I think is much from by the pace of transactions just coming in the door right now that will drive what we are able to do this year and we think that will continue to play a role in obviously growing the revenue and AFFO, which is what drives dividend increases. I think secondly and equally important for us is it will also help us in adjusting the makeup of our portfolio where we’re trying to do a couple of things, which is move up the credit curve with the tenant base and then also into areas both inside and outside of retail that we think want to make up a larger piece of the portfolio and going forward. If you look at the last 24 months or so, we bought about $1.7 billion of property, $1 billion of it was in retail and I think much in the sector is that we think will do well if we continue with a tougher retail environment where lower income consumers continue to struggle. $720 million of the properties we bought are into areas outside of retail that we think will do well for us and of the $1.7 billion total about $770 million was done with investment grade tenants and a good measure of the rest of the acquisitions are also up the credit curve close to investment grade and we’re pleased with that. The other thing about it is how we’ve funded the acquisitions. Living in a very low interest rate environment that’s largely generated by monetary policy at the federal level, I think it’s easy to get lulled in to the assumption that rates will stay low, which they might. However, we want to be mindful of where they could go in the future particularly if they were to go up substantially and I think that is true not only for our tenants as they would refinance their balance sheet down the road but I think also for our own balance sheet. And one of the things we want to make sure we do is we are fairly active here in acquiring is we don’t materially add to our levels or to our near-term maturities. So if you look at the permanent financing that we’ve done or our funding of these acquisitions over the last 24 months or so, we did four equity offerings that generated gross proceeds of just over $1 billion. We did $150 of debts that had a maturity of 20, 35 and then last week we did the perpetual preferred offering, which is – was $373 million. And that is about $1.5 billion in capital and with either no maturity or a small piece of maturity there the far end of the future. And as we think about capital we’ll continue to keep in mind that the cost to capital could be materially higher in the future and the cost of refinancing that could be an issue. So we’ll try and take care of that in terms of how we are funding the acquisitions. Relative to the balance sheet and access to capital, we’re in very good shape. As Paul mentioned there’s plenty of drive powder to continue to acquire. On earning and guidance, obviously the acquisitions, occupancy and same-store rent increases the portfolio had in 2011, really drove the revenue, FFO and AFFO and that will benefit us with the acquisitions here in 2012. In the release a couple of weeks ago, we adjusted our guidance for the preferred issuance to 201 to 205 on FFO and that included that non-cash charge that Paul talked about and then AFFO 207 to 212 and that’s 3% to 5.5% AFFO growth and that number will be our primary focus as Paul mentioned into the best we have for recurring cash flow right now. Kind of finally before we take questions, I’d be remiss if like Paul, I didn’t mention the press release yesterday announcing the 500th consecutive monthly dividend. That’s over 41 years of monthly dividends, it’s a long time. I think the company was about at 108th consecutive dividends when I came in to do due diligence in the company and met the founders Bill and John Clark. It’s probably over 200 when I came to work here 25 years ago and I called the Clarks who are actively retired to talk to them about getting to 500 and I liked their comment which is very typical for them which was “That’s great and I hope you guys are focused on the next 500,” which we are. Anyway a nice milestone for the company that they founded a long time ago. Operator, we will now open it up to questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) And we have a question from the line of Lindsay Schroll from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Lindsay Schroll – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Good afternoon. Can you guys please discuss the health of the casual dining (inaudible) overall and whether the filings by Friendly’s and Buffets are more retailer specific issues or indicative of broader industry trends?
Tom Lewis: Yeah. It’s a good question, happy to do that. We’re not overly positive on the industry to say the least. I think a theme in almost everything we’ve looked at today is whether it’s in casual dining or somewhere else is to try and look at the consumer at that individual retailer or here restaurant is targeting because if you look at kind of the upper income consumer, they are spending both discretionary and non-discretionary. The middle market consumer which seems to be a little smaller group today is spending on non-discretionary but is really looking for value when they’re our doing discretionary spending and that includes casual dining. And then when you get to the lower end consumer, not only are they extraordinarily value-conscious on discretionary or non-discretionary they are almost aren’t spending on discretionary. So pick your casual dining and pick who their customer is but I think for a lot of people most of those changed or appealing to the middle and lower market and it’s a tough operating environment and we think it will continue to be so. The other thing that’s going in there over the last couple of year is also minimum wage has gone from I think $5.85 an hour up to over $7 in the quarter, so they’ve seen some labor pressures and then at the same time had some commodity costs move. But we have the industry rather – relative to further investment kind of we’re not going to do it and then we’d like to continue to reduce it as part of the portfolio because it’s an area that even though for short periods it can snap back. We are not overly positive with it. I’d be remiss if I didn’t note there were chains doing very well in that industry and there are but casual dining for us as we watch is an industry that we’re not going to be doing additional acquisitions in.
Lindsay Schroll – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then I think you’ve talked about wanting to dispose of your office assets and I’m just wondering what demand is those versus retail, if the cap rates are similar, the buyer is the same. If you can just talk about that?
Tom Lewis: Yeah. I don’t think we’re looking to dispose of it. We don’t have much in that area and they’re with very high quality tenants. I think it’s more of comments that that’s not something we’re looking to aggressively add to the portfolio. In the ECM transaction we had a couple of few office buildings that came with that but it’s still a relative small part of the portfolio, it’s only about 2.6% of rent. So I wouldn’t see it increasing but currently we don’t have plans to sell the assets.
Lindsay Schroll – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: Hi, good afternoon. I certainly hope there’s not going to be a quiz on all those numbers that you guys threw out.
Tom Lewis: Sorry about that.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: That’s okay. Just a couple of quick questions, when you guys were talking about the eventual rents from releasing the Buffets and the Friendly’s deal what’s the time horizon that you’re using for releasing those assets?
Tom Lewis: It varies a little. In the Friendly’s, I believe we assumed in our -- that we didn’t lease anything until late in the year or early in the next year. We think we’ll do better with the Buffets. We had a little more aggressive move on it because we’ve had a little better luck as we’ve gone through this recently.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Has any of them actually been released so far?
Paul Meurer: There are LOIs in place in a handful and so I think of that estimate is kind of 6 to 18 months and what that means is you’ll have some outliers that happen sooner and you’ll have some outliers that happen later than that.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. And regarding casual dining, obviously we’ve talked a lot about that. Can you talk about these sponsors of the casual diners especially the ones that you have exposure to and what their wiliness to restructure or to keep those entities going rather that bankrupt them right now? What those owner posture tends to be of today?
Tom Lewis: They tend not to be 7s, they tend to be 11s. Certainly that was the case in Friendly’s and that’s the case in Buffets. And when you think to sponsor you kind of wanted – there’s a couple of things obviously, these are levered entities and one of the strategies in the toolbox of these people has been to – if the chain starts to struggle in the debt trades to a discount, go into the market, buy the debt and they become both the debt and equity owner and that gives us some optionality to go through an 11, continue it on the chains and do some work on the contracts, other contracts of it. But I think as long as they can see in the properties profitability and the chain overall they’re obviously going to look for an 11 and that will either be through the debtor is becoming the owner or in the case as I mentioned were both – both have the same. But if you look Friendly’s and Buffets both the rents are pretty low, which gives them the opportunity to do that and the what we’ve tried to do in all of these of course is get some optionality for if the business recovers that we can get a piece of that. But in most cases, they do want to operate but it’s a chain by chain basis. There has been a fair amount of bankruptcy in that industry over the last four or five years, 34 or 35 of them and the vast majority have been 11.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik with Morningstar.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Hi good afternoon guys.
Tom Lewis: Hey, Todd.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Just a quick question on the acquisitions. Do you guys have a preference right now for doing deals with the credit tenants in 7s versus the non-credit tenants in the 8s or still happy to do either category?
Tom Lewis: We are happy to do either and it really is investment grade and we would like to take it up the credit curve when we can find them. It’s a competitive world today, but like to do that. And then, when they are not investment grade, we’d rather be moving kind of up the cusp with it. And when you get to non-investment grade, it again is kind of a tenant with a low income consumer and discretionary we really don’t want to be investing there even though yields can be very attractive and we are willing to do both today.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Okay. And then, just the acquisition assumption that’s currently embedded in your guidance?
Tom Lewis: I think right now about $0.5 billion is what I have got in there.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Okay. And in thinking about same store rent growth, is 1% to 2% still a good long-term assumption for that?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, I would think I would hang around the 1% level or closer to that through the first half of the year as we deal with some of these properties and that was a case a few years ago. And then, I think it probably – long-term probably 1% to 1.5% is to consider average, when we get above 1.5% that’s high just given the way lease structures work.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Okay. And you mentioned that I guess a couple of other categories that contributed to the increase in the last quarter, the motor vehicles and the casual dining that was from the expiration of rent reductions. And this quarter, I guess is that something that lasts than for 12 months in the same store numbers, but that this time next year that impact would drop off?
Tom Lewis: Yes, I think that’s the case and then I would also think we will get some boost from leasing.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Tom Lewis: Okay, you bet.
Operator: Thank you. And you next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo Securities: Hi guys, thanks. Tom, you were indicating a vacancy that’s higher than expected in the fourth quarter. Other than the friendly stuff, who was the tenant on the bulk of those?
Tom Lewis: I would have to go look. It was an automotive, it was service, but what it was is, we have vacant properties and then we have a list and there is generally 20 to 30 properties on it that are closed properties, but they are still under a long-term lease and the tenant is healthy. And what happened at the end of the third quarter, there was a bunch of properties that a tenant has closed about two years that was still under lease and still paying. And those all came off at once and so, we've gone back and we've looked at that list, which O exists at this very little of that this year, very little next year, but it was one little lump and I forgot, but it is an automotive service tenant I believe that was a bunch of them and then there were just a couple of others.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. Will they likely be teed up for sale?
Tom Lewis: We will tee them up for re-lease or sale both.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. And just along those same lines, could you be – say any disposition volumes increase maybe ahead of schedule, maybe where you thought you would be this time last year, just to get out in front of some of these credit issues?
Tom Lewis: That’s exactly what our plan is in terms of property sales. We have typically sold $25 million, $30 million of properties a year, but that’s mostly just working through lease roll over and occasionally tenant issue and that’s just been kind of the average, but we really do want to accelerate that kind of bid and if it’s okay, I will spend a second on it. Over the last year, we want back and undertook a very lengthy project that took about 7 to 8 months where we re-underwrote basically the majority of the portfolio. I think we picked the largest 67 tenants and they combined at about 83% of our rents. And we went through a rating of each industry, we then went through our exposures relative to how many of their units we own, how many units we own, percent of rent and then, went back to their credit ratings around their balance sheets, debt maturity schedule, usage of line of credit cash, debt after cash liquidity revenue. And then, went after their trends and looked at the margin trends and revenue trends and fixed charge coverages. And then literally remodeled each one of them once again and started running some stress tests where we move their revenues and margins and then kind of refinance their whole balance sheet over the next 5 to 7 years. And we added on 300 basis points, a higher financing cost of 600 basis points and then did some mixing of that to get a perfect storm. And we took all of that and that kind of guided us along with some themes we had, their interest rates too, how is retail going to be different that the low end consumer may have trouble coming back, the non-discretionary is going to be difficult. And in doing that then really we kind of laid out our top to bottom in the portfolio. At the same time, we did the same with properties and when we got through, we merged that and basically came up with a group of the portfolio that over time that we would like to move out of and in combinations with acquisitions and sales, kind of re-orient the portfolio. And initially, we targeted a little over a 100 properties about $110 million or so we bought those out, about $100 million of carrying value. And we have started a process to market them and we have done some staffing, done some systems and we have just literally launched that over the last month or so. So, for this year, if we can move that up to $50 million from the normal $25 million to $35 million that would be just great. My sense is to do the whole $110 million will be moving in through this year and early in the next year, but the plan right after that will then be to take the next on the list and we would like to over the next three, four, five years be fairly active in recycling capital and moving into some new areas that we’d rather have in the portfolio.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay, that’s really helpful, thanks Tom. And just lastly, it looks like, did you have one agricultural property? Did I see that right?
Tom Lewis: We did. We had one additional property, Diageo, it’s in the Napa Valley. It’s kind of wedged in between the other vineyards that we owned and it is one that we had looked at doing a ways back, but there were a couple of complications operationally for them on it, but we were able to do that. So, it’s a little addition to the Diageo portfolio.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo Securities: Any pricing on that, any indication what the cap rate was?
Tom Lewis: It’s relatively similar to what we did two years ago.
Todd Stender – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Thanks, good afternoon. Just following up on that Tom and thanks for laying out your thoughts on dispositions. Can you give us any sense of what that magnitude might look like against the $500 million of acquisitions you are thinking about for 2012?
Tom Lewis: Yeah. There is about – well acquisitions for 2012. Again, our best guess this year is we would like to do 50 and that probably adds in 25 to 30 of this new grouping of investment properties we’d like to sell. So that’s the number there, but there is $110 million probably over the next 18 to 24 months. And then behind that as we went through and did the whole portfolio it wasn’t we need to sell these now, but these are areas we want to move out of. It is about 20% of the portfolio where you looked at, instead over the next four or five years that’s what we would want to recycle.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: When you say 20% of the portfolio, is that 20% of value or 20% of the buildings?
Tom Lewis: Revenue.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Revenue?
Tom Lewis: Yeah.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: So, I mean, does that suggest there’s a lot, like a much bigger ramp in sales beyond 2012 and 2015 with that?
Tom Lewis: No, if you think of about 20% that’s 400 or 500 properties, so I think over three to five years that’s about 80 properties a year or something.
Paul Meurer: And to some extent more art than science Tony. So, for example if we – buy $1 billion worth of real estate again this year, then maybe we can do more than $50 million in sales this year, who knows. So, we will kind of manage that from an earnings run rate perspective as well.
Tom Lewis: Yeah, it’s a balancing act with acquisitions and all the other things going on in the portfolio and still hitting good numbers and raising the dividend, but we think we can move a good part of the portfolio over the next two years.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Okay. And then, you talked a bit about same store revenue. I was wondering if you would give a sense of same store NOI maybe net of things like the $7.5 million of property expenses that you bear. The effect of the phase and in Friendly’s this year, just some the vacancy ticked up in the fourth quarter from some of those leases that burned off and just how that roles into a same store NOI number for 2012?
Paul Meurer: Okay, let me.
Tom Lewis: Let us work on that.
Paul Meurer: And the one thing we do, I think we do a pretty good job of giving you the specifics of how we approach same store calculation in the 10-Qs and 10-Ks, but we will have that laid out to give you exactly what we have put in it versus what’s not it, because everyone does it a little bit differently. I think what you are generally going to find and that’s why Tom tried to give you some guidance on where we get some bumps in which industries and which ones were down is that obviously, the ones that we got bumps in, it was probably a number of slightly healthier than 1% to 1.5%. But the ones, the vacancy is what really drives it down to that kind of overall run rate. So, when you are modeling for the overall portfolio that’s why we are guiding you to that 1% to 1.5% area.
Tom Lewis: Yeah, and I don’t have that number off the top of my head Tony, but if you want to e-mail what the piece of puzzle is, let us take a look at it.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Sure, and I guess, what struck me and where I was coming from was even between the 1% to 2% ban being towards the lower end of that, it still seemed like not a whole lot of impact given what's happened with Buffet’s and Friendly’s and stuff. Is that like all those things?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, that’s very fair, it definitely impacts. When we talk about an 80% recovery rate that is when we get those leased up, so if you have a event happen for the 12 months after that the impact is certainly greater than the 20% that you don't recover, because that's during the period where they are vacant and aside from not gaining rent, there is also the triple net expenses and so, in a year like this and it really bans the year between Friendly’s and Buffet’s. That does have a pretty good impact, it may exceed the same-store rent for a period of time until you get those leased.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: But even with the impact on a top line of Friendly’s and Buffet’s, you still think you will come in that low 1s?
Tom Lewis: I am only hesitating, because I'm trying to make sure I understand what the numbers are.
Paul Meurer:
 :
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Right.
Paul Meurer: Fair enough. Your question is on the projection for 2012 and I think what we are seeing is, we were expecting same-store rent to be more like 1.5% plus next year, reasonably healthy from an overall historical perspective for us. And the Buffet’s and Friendly’s vacancy is what's dragging that down closer to a 1% number, certainly for the first nine months of the year or so.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Okay. Yeah, no I just wanted to make sure that was in that low 1s, because I would have actually guessed it to have had a greater negative impact in that. Great, and then, just the last thing, just curious as you thought about your strategy in the push towards a little bit more higher credit quality, a desire to go up the credit quality spectrum. Like how do you think about going higher credit quality versus perhaps maybe any other options like staying where you are on the credit spectrum and focusing more on certain MSAs or just a different product category or something like that?
Paul Meurer: Yeah, that's a very good question. I think rather than what we are doing talking about why we are doing, it's really important. And starting about four or five years ago as we were doing strategic planning, one of the things we did is, let’s look back at the last 20 years and say, it obviously went really well. And then say, okay, why did it go really well and to try and differentiate between being in the right place at the right time and then secondarily, what we did and there are kind of three themes in there that are driving it. One is looking at retail, in our business if you look at the last 20 years, you had great domestic economic growth, personal income growth, the baby boomers were peak earnings and spending years, the next one is very important, the consumer levered up. Retail spending growth rates were really high, retailers added a lot of new stores and it was the right place to be at the right time and we were. And then we said, okay, let's look forward, there is a bid of the new normal the term goes around, debt to GDP is approaching 90%, which takes something out of GDP growth and personal income growth, the baby boomers are ageing, you got the baby bus behind them. And the consumers unlikely to lever up at the same rate, because they can't and may even de-lever a bit. And so, maybe retail isn’t as – the growth rate isn’t as high as it was in the past. And then, you throw in kind of the impact of Internet on retailing and you say, it’s the difference between running downhill and the difference between running on flat ground or flat land and the first step was to say, okay, industry and tenant selection will be more important in the future than in the past, because it’s just not as a environment. And then, really going to one step further and saying, let’s take a look at the consumer. The low-end consumer did pretty well over the last 15 to 20 years with all of the growth in construction and real estate and the building trades. Home improvement, there was a fair part of what normally would be kind of the lower income market that we think crept into the kind of middle income market and we are not sure that will be the case in the future. So, let's look at each business we have and which consumer it serves and assume it's not going to be as good as it could. The second thing which is also really, really important and I alluded to that, take a minute [ph] is with interest rates and I get the tenure year over the last 30 years ago from 14% to 16% to 2% and that's very much running downhill. And that obviously made asset prices rise, but kind of more importantly made leverage always work and refinance always work and there were a lot of what might have been marginal business models that worked, because interest rates were falling so fast. And there was a fair amount of our tenants that used a fair amount of leverage in environment when interest rates were going down. And so, with the tenure 2%, the chance of having a material declining interest rate environment is almost zero, because if you go from 2% to 1%, it’s only 1% and so that benefit won't be as robust. And then you say okay, what if rates stay low, well, that’s generally because the economy is probably limping along and very timid [ph] relative to economic growth and in that environment over time, the possibility you could see credit spreads gap, which means refinance rates for those tenants would be higher. And then moving out 5 to 7 years, you take a look at those tenants and you say, if they had to refinance their entire balance sheet, what it would do? And that's what started that project which we did where we really know what it would do. And then, you throw in obviously, anybody that has impact by Internet. And when we got done with all of that, we said okay, look, we want to go up the credit curve, so 5 to 7 years from now interest rates are higher and the tenants have to refinance their balance sheet and that sucks cash flows really out of their income statements, it can have an impact and default rates will be greater in the next 20 than the last 20. So you put those two together and then kind of the last one that’s the net lease retail spaces become more competitive and more mainstream and so, that launched us in a couple of directions. One, just generically up the credit curve and not just into investment grade, but in the portfolio for those less investment grade higher up the curve. Second, in terms of the type of consumer they really serve, again, we want to stay away from more of the consumer discretionary. And then third, where can we go outside of retail that should benefit, good examples are FedEx, and the impacted as for them with Internet taking more and more of retail sales and other areas where we can also get investment grade credit and then maybe even have some very large Fortune 1000 tenants that are benefiting from having a presence overseas where we are not, but as they are our tenant of ours, we would benefit. So, it was all of those kind of put together that we said, okay, in retail, up the curve, out of certain areas and into others and then outside of retail up the credit curve, so we wake up 5, 7, 8 years down the road and we have kind of remade the portfolio. And if it is that’s going to slow our retail environment and/or interest rates were materially higher, it won't have near the impact that might have because the last 20, 30 years and track record, it was put together because that is a function of the operating conditions to some extent and it’s unlikely that that will persist into the future, so that was kind of the thought process.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Okay, yeah, thank you. I appreciate that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Market. Please go ahead.
Rich Moore – RBC Market: Yeah, hi, good afternoon guys. I was looking at the or thinking about the impact of Friendly’s. And I went back to the press release you guys had, is that what you pretty much are seeing what you put in the press release on January 18, is that still what you expect from the Friendly’s closures and then how much you recover of what's left?
Paul Meurer: Yes.
Rich Moore – RBC Market: Okay, and at what point in the year did they stop, did all of this take place. I mean you said it was late in the year, but was it – how much of that fourth quarter rent I guess we see?
Paul Meurer: We received October rent and then the impact say 15 of the 19 rejections, we did not receive November or December rent. And then, the other four rejections we haven’t received January’s rent, just to kind to give you a feel.
Rich Moore – RBC Market: Okay, that does. And then as far as what you will recover from the others, when did that start, the reduction?
Paul Meurer:
 :
 :
Rich Moore – RBC Market: October was a full rent. I got you. And then for the phase, you are thinking, obviously nothing is happening. Are you thinking the same that you have in the press release, the same sort of same sort of parameters that you mentioned in here?
Paul Meurer:
 :
Rich Moore – RBC Market: Okay. And those parameters Paul as far as how much base rent you will lose and what the concessions will be on there mainly. Do you still feel comfortable about that?
Paul Meurer: Yes, we are at the same place where we were with the press release a couple weeks ago.
Tom Lewis: Yeah, absolutely.
Rich Moore – RBC Market:
 :
Tom Lewis: Correct.
Rich Moore – RBC Market:
 :
Tom Lewis: Sometimes a little.
Paul Meurer:
 :
Rich Moore – RBC Market:
 :
 :
 :
 :
 :
Paul Meurer: Yeah, a lot of the buildings are set up for that, so it generally is and I could give you other things they would become, but it’s really anecdotal, they are restaurants.
Rich Moore – RBC Market: Okay. All right, very good. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session for the Realty Income operating results conference call. Mr. Lewis, please go ahead.
Tom Lewis: Okay. Well, listen thanks everybody for being with us today, I know it's a busy schedule and we appreciate the attention and we will talk to you in about 90 days and thank you, Diane.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Lewis. Go ahead sir.
Tom Lewis: Thank you, Joe. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our conference call. We will go throw the operations and results for the third quarter and year to-date. With me in the ring today as usually is Gary Malino, our President, Paul Meurer, our EVP and CFO, John Case, our EVP and Chief investment Office and Mike Pfeiffer, our EVP and General Counsel. And as always during this call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law and the company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in the forward-looking statements, we’ll disclose in greater detail in the company’s Form 10-Q, the factors that could cause the differences. And as usual Mr. Meurer will start with the review of the numbers,
Paul Meurer:  Thanks Tom. As usual let me go through the financial statements briefly, provide a few highlights of the financial results for the quarter, starting with income statement. Total revenue increased 23.6% to $107.39 million this quarter versus $86.8 million during the third quarter of last year. This obviously reflected a significant amount of new acquisitions over the past year, but also positive same store rent increases for the quarterly period of 1.8%.  On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $7.9 million in the comparative quarter, as depreciation expense increases obviously as our property portfolio continues to grow. Interest expense increased by just over $3.4 million, this increase was due primarily to the June issuance of $150 million of notes in the reopening of our 2035 bond, but also because of the $96.6 million credit facility balance at quarter end. On a related note our coverage ratios both remain strong; interest coverage is now at 3.9 times and fixed charge coverage now at 2.9 times. General administrative or G&A expenses in the third quarter were $7.1 million, representing 6.7% of total revenues, as compared to $6.2 million during the third quarter of last year, which represented 7.1% of total revenues at that time.  Our G&A expense has increased a bit, as our acquisition activity has increased and we have invested in some new personnel for future growth. This quarter’s G&A was also impacted by the expensing of $233,000 worth of acquisition due diligence cost. Our current projection for G&A for 2011 is approximately $30 million, which will represent only about 7% of total revenues. Property expenses decreased to just under $1.7 million for the quarter. These expenses are primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance and insurance expenses, which we are responsible for on properties available for lease. Our current estimates for all of 2011 is about $7.5 million. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company and they were $367,000 during the quarter. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled just over $3.1 million. This income was associated with our property sales activity during the quarter. Our Crest subsidiary did not acquire or sell any properties in the quarter. We did sell 12 properties from our core portfolio resulting in gain on sales of $3.1 million and a reminder that these property sales gains are not included in our FFO or in our AFFO calculation. Preferred stock cash dividends remains at $6.1 million and net income available to common stockholders increased to approximately $34.7 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO increased 32.6% to $63.4 million for the quarter. FFO per share increased 8.7% to $0.50 for the quarter. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO are the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends was higher at $0.51 per share for the quarter and our AFFO is usually higher than our FFO because our capital expenditures are fairly low and we have minimal straight line rent in the portfolio. We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter, we’ve increased the dividend 56 consecutive quarters and 63 times overall since we went public over 17 years ago this month. Our dividend pay-out ratio for the quarter was 87% of our FFO and 85% of our AFFO. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain a conservative and safe capital structure. In September as you know we raised just over $200 million of new capital in a common stock offering. Our current debt to total market capitalization is only 28% and our preferred stock outstanding represents to 5% of our capital structure. And as I mentioned we have $96.6 million of borrowing on our $425 million credit facility. We have no debt maturities until 2013 and so in summary we currently have excellent liquidity and overall balance sheet remains very healthy and safe. Let me turn the call now back to Tom, who will give you a little bit background on these results.
Tom Lewis: Thanks Paul. I will start with the portfolio which performed very well during the third quarter operations continued to improve across portfolio. At the end of the quarter, our largest 15 tenants accounted for 51.2% of our revenue that was down a little bit from last quarter and the average cash flow coverage to store level for those 15 tenants remains fairly high at 2.41 times during the quarter. We ended the third quarter at 97.7% occupancy and 59 properties available for lease out of the -- this is unusual where even number and number of properties 2,600 properties and that’s up about 40 basis points and occupancy from the second quarter and up about a 130 basis points for the same period a year ago. In the quarter, we had only six new vacancies and then we lease ourselves 15 properties and obviously added to the portfolio and that’s the reason for the increase in the occupancy but obviously very healthy at 97.7%. My sense is, we should look for some moderation in occupancy in the fourth quarter and that’s primarily due to a number of lease rollovers that occurred at the beginning of the quarter. There were 18 that came off lease and sometimes these rollovers get a bit lumpy and that was the case this quarter. And then a 15 Friendly’s properties we got back. Our best estimate right now is about 97% of our occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter. And then we would anticipate as we re-lease, those properties that came off the rollover and Friendly’s that would go back up in the first quarter of next year, but a good guess is 97%. Same-store rents on the core portfolio increased 1.8% during the third quarter that’s same as the second quarter and 1.5% year-to-date, that’s a very healthy number for us in that lease company. And if you wanted to look across portfolio kind of where the increases and decreases came from, we had only four industries that have declining same-store rents during the quarter that was office supplies, child care, auto service and book stores, but was a very small decline of only $50,000. Two of the industries were flat, and then 23 had same-store rent increases with the majority coming from motion picture theaters and convenient stores and then to kind of my surprise casual dining restaurants and motor vehicle dealerships, both of those as a function of. During the recession we had some rent reductions, we did for those tenants and those burned off, their businesses come back very nicely and that’s the reason that happened this quarter even though I think their fundamentals may not be a representative of that we did see the rent go up. The balance of the industries had fairly small increases during the quarter, but the 23 industries together had increases of about $1.45 million per net gain of $1.4 million. And obviously, the occupancy gains and things for rent increases over the last four quarters have been very healthy and it continued in the third quarter. A relative to diversification, obviously up to 2600 properties at the end of the quarter that is up 77 properties from last quarter, 38 different industries, 134 multiple unit tenants in 49 states. From an industry exposure standpoint, we continue to diversify with 38 industries that’s up six from the same period a year ago. And our major concentrations of the top couple came down a bit. Convenient stores were 18.3% that’s down about 70 basis points from last quarter. And then restaurant is a little less than last quarter also at 17.3%. Theaters were up a bit at 140 basis points to 9.2% that’s a function of some recent acquisitions and then health and fitness which is 6.1% then the only other category that are over 5% today is beverages at 5.6%, automotive tire stores which have been along with convenient stores both at 5.2% and those were much larger concentrations going back quite a ways. So, pretty good shape by industry, the large is tenants switch this quarter to AMC theatres to 5.4% and again that’s a function of some acquisitions. Diageo second at 5% and then everything else is under 5%. I mentioned our 15 largest tenants are 52% of rent. When you can get to the 15th largest tenant, as you can see in the release, its about 2.2% and goes down from there and when you get to the 20th largest tenant you are only about 1.5% of rent. So, we continue to diversify the portfolio. That’s also true from a geographic standpoint. Still in 49 states everywhere but Hawaii. Average remaining lease length in the portfolio at 11.1 year remains pretty healthy so obviously good quarter for the portfolio. As we look forward kind of in the next year we thing expectations for economic growth not withstanding higher than expected GP numbers today that have moderated over the last couple of quarters and I think that will lead us to be a little more cautious about the portfolio going into 2012.  If we look across the retail landscape, I think most of us deserve that the kind of high end and retail are holding up well. We don’t have a lot of that. At the low end, it is tough in retail, but the dollar stores and the value retailers club stores seem to be doing pretty well, serving that market. And as we look out there and in areas that might highlight some concern I think it’s really in the consumer discretionary area to the middle and lower class and you can see their businesses being stretched a bit. Some of it margin compression is there as the cost go up. But if you look in to areas like casual dinning and similar electronics auto supplies we think those are all worth watching.  Fortunately, most of our portfolio is in the basic needs type of businesses with the tires stores auto service, C-stores that type of things which are doing pretty well. But, looking at the portfolio absent Friendly’s nothing is popped up, that gives us concern from a tenant standpoint. But we adjusted our expectations a bit for the portfolio. And in the guidance for 2012, is our expected impact from the Friendly’s filing. And as well, we also added into the estimate an expectation of additional filings of tenants equal to about 5% of revenue with what has been our normal recovery rates over time. And while we don’t know would be we just think in an environment the little tough in retail, it was good for us to do that in our guidance. We also in the guidance assume that none of the properties come back from Friendly or the other tenants would be leased during 2012. So, I think that we have been conservative in our estimates relative to the portfolio. That now we understanding, we still think that our occupancy will remain very high in 2012, in the 97% range and we will have to see that works out. But overall, we think we will have high occupancy. Moving on the property acquisitions obviously a very strong quarter and year for acquisition and I'll let John Case, our Chief Investment Officer, comment on kind of what we bought and what the environment is.
John Case: Our acquisitions activity continue to be robust in the third quarter. We acquired 89 properties for approximately $462 million making the third quarter or second most active quarter for acquisitions in our company’s history. The average initial lease yield on these investments was just the shade over 8.1%, and the average lease term is approximately 10 years. Properties are diversified by geography and industry and property type. They are located in 15 states, are 100% lease the nine tenants in seven different industries and represent three property types with our traditional retail investments accounting for just over 88% in the third quarter acquisition volume. The industries are automotive collision services, food processing, how to get quick service restaurant, theaters, transportation services and hotel plus. Of the $462 million that we acquired in the third quarter, a $189 million is part of the $544 million diversified net-leased portfolio acquisition we announced in the first quarter. At the third quarter end, we had closed $525 million of the $544 million acquisition during the first, second, and third quarter. The final $19 million of the portfolio should close in this quarter. So for the first three quarters of 2011 then, we have acquired a 125 properties for $826 million with an average initial lease yield of approximately 8% and an average lease term of about eleven and a half years. The properties are leased to 20 commercial tenants in 15 different industry segments. The $826 million in acquisitions we have completed in the first three quarters, the most we have completed in any previously full calendar year. For the entire year, we expect to complete just over $850 million in acquisitions at an average initial yield of about 8%. So, we continue to be pleased with our acquisitions activity. As we look forward, acquisitions transaction flow remained strong. With the high-yield and CNDS markets cooling off since this year, property owners continue to turn to the sale lease back market for liquidity. There continues to be significant competition with property portfolios with multiple sources with a good bit of capital. But we should continue to be competitive in the marketplace. We are currently seeing opportunities in all of our property type and in a wide variety of industry from tenant. The majority of our current acquisition opportunities are in our traditional retail property. Initial yields and cap rate seem to be holding steady for now ranging from the mid 7% area for high credit tenants up to the low 9% range for some of the smaller non-investment grade tenant property. We continue to believe that our initial yield on future acquisitions should average right around 8%. Tom?
Tom Lewis: Thanks, John. I would like the higher credit tenants at 9%, can you arrange that for us?
John Case: Yes, I will do my best.
Tom Lewis: Okay. As John mentioned the pace of transactions, we look that has been very good and obviously we have gotten enough of share over the last 18 months or so, and that's let do a couple of year-to-year record acquisitions. But, I also want to note that that level has been very heavily impacted by a few large transactions, if you recall the Diageo we have done over $300 million. The ECM portfolio earlier in the year is $544 million, and then there were several others that equated to about a half a billion dollars and those transactions account pretty much for the majority of the acquisitions that we have done this year and last year. And so I just want caution to extrapolate that out and assume the same things happen in 2012 might be aggressive. And aggressive assumption, we said for many years kind of being out there in the business you do. 25 to 35 a quarter by being in the business and if you do a run rate that works up to $100 million or $200 million a year. And then it’s really a function of whether we grab 0, 1, 2, 3 or a couple of larger transaction and while lately we have obviously had a bunch of them, each year it kind of unfolds with last two years itself. I think more than our fair of share. So for our planning purposes and our guidance for some acquisitions for next year, we are assuming $315 million of acquisitions of what we are using in guidance that an age cape rate, and obviously it could be more but that’s a I think a good number to start with. We'll adjust as 2012 develops. But the transaction flow remains very robust currently.  As far the balance sheet and access to capital, as Paul mentioned, we are in fairly good shape on that. We have only $96 million sitting on the $425 million line. So the vast majority of the acquisitions we made this year have been permanently financed at fairly attractive rates. And with the balance sheet in great shape with good metrics that leaves us plenty of dry powder to execute on an acquisitions to come up. Let me go back to guidance and kind of walk through that, obviously with acquisition things strong and occupancy and same-store rent up, that’s been very health for FFO and AFFO numbers. And we think that will continue to be the case the balance for this year and moving in to next year. We did release a couple of weeks ago where we updated guidance and initiated for 2011 initiated 2012. For this year we are estimating FFO of a $1.97 to $1.98 at 7.70% to 8.2 % FFO growth and then AFFO of $2.01 to $2.02 and that’s 8.1% to 8.6% AFFFO growth. And as usual our AFFO, Paul mentioned this, but really wanted to highlight it, its higher than our FFO. And lately that’s been widening a bit, which is a function of a number of the acquisitions that we made this year, we are on existing properties with existing leases. And so we had to do a FAS141 adjustment. And in net lease generally that means that you reported cap rate when that been slightly below the actual cash you receive on the leases. And that really is going to widen the gap to get between FFO and AFFO, with AFFO being higher. We obviously take dividends from cash, so AFFO number continue to be our primary focus. For 2012, right now you can see the estimates FFO $2.07 to $2.11, that’s about 4.5% to 7% of FFO growth. And AFFO of $2.11 to $2.16, also about 4.5% to 7.5%. with this growth rate the dividend payout ratio is falling down into the kind of 85%, 86%, 87% rate and we would achieve the guidance that would continue next year and really accelerate that. And generally we want to keep our payout ratio in the 85% to 90% range. So we are optimistic about additional growth in the dividend and the amount of growth looking into 2012. I think it would be a good time for dividend increases. I’ll take a second since we just came out with 2012, kind of walk through again the assumption that are embedded in the 2012 guidance. As I mentioned, acquisitions of $350 million at an 8% cap rate, that’s less than half this year and last year. But, as I said, these were exceptional years driven by some large transaction. So I think it’s proven to keep the expectations moderated for now. Our capital will depend on the timing of the acquisition. Estimated property sales we put in at $25 million. We have interest rates moving up modestly throughout the year but still very low, so not a huge impact. We’re putting occupancy kind of in the 96%, 97% range, and that is really where we’re reflecting the front lease plus an addition on identified tenant issues that can come up. And again, we have built into the assumptions for front lease outcome as well as it’s 5% and also the fact that we’re just assuming conservatively that it takes through 2012 to lease any of them, which is a conservative assumption. Same-store rent, we modeled at about 1.50% growth, which would be pretty good. Free cash flow at $50 million. And, as I mentioned, AFFO of $0.04 to $0.05 above FFO, and that’s what gets us to the 4.50% to 7.50% FFO and AFFO growth rates. To the extent that tenant issues do not materialize that obviously would be great. Our acquisitions would have had $350 million that also would be very good. I think we would probably take the opportunity to do some paring to the portfolio and sell some properties and move out maybe some of the tenants or properties that we think might have more exposure from an economic and interest rate standpoint going forward. That would likely burn off a little bit of FFO during the year, but really above the 4.50% to 7.50% rate that would probably be prudent and something we would like to do in the next few years. So we think the assumptions we made are pretty good assumptions. Really to summarize then obviously continued stability in the portfolio and a good quarter relative to occupancy and same-store rent increases. We remain very active in acquisitions with good FFO and AFFO growth, this year, and I think, pointing into next year, one again makes us somewhat optimistic to for dividend growth. And with that, we will open it up for questions. So Joe if you want to comeback and remind everybody how to do that again, I would appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Lindsay Schroll. Go ahead please.
Lindsay Schroll - UBS: Tom, I know that you mentioned casual dining rents were up. But I was just wondering if you can discuss more to the fundamentals of that segment and if there are any other tenants that are kind of on your watch list in that segment?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, it’s, if you look at casual dining they’re a very good example. I was looking at some numbers yesterday relative to food prices this year that have been moving up pretty aggressively. And if you look at the grocers, they’ve been able to pass a lot of that on, I think was about 6% increases in food prices at grocery stores. But if you look at restaurants they haven’t been able to pass it on and consumers have been pretty tied with their wallets, wallet to the restaurants. And so, you’re seeing their cost move up and they’re not able to pass it on. And I think it’s really starting to wear on their margins. And so that’s one area that’s kind of upfront for us. And we think other areas in consumer discretion that are impacted by commodity cost are similar. The other ones, and I also mentioned, is if you just look at kind of the big box that tends to be discretionary purchase. We look at them and you continue to see the growth of Internet retailing and that’s kind of front and center right now as we move into the holidays, and we think their business could be a little weak. But it’s primarily consumer discretionary, middle class, lower class, and I try to light on restaurants. Normally fast food does very well in a downturn but I think even they’re having trouble kind of passing it all along.
Lindsay Schroll - UBS: Okay. And then just turning to acquisitions, what do you think in the macro environment can change that would potentially shutdown some of the opportunities you’re seeing decrease the flow?
Tom Lewis: I think it would take a pretty good drop in the economy on one side. But John mentioned the high yield market, while it’s had a little bit of resurgence in the last week or so, has been weak, but still breathing and CMBS has been very weak. And a lot of times Paul has used the term we like those markets breathing but not too robust, because it helps transactions to happen and yet it makes our type of financing very attractive. And even though they’ve been very weak we found that people have really started turning to net lease. So those markets came back very strong. It would be a mixed bag. I think we would see a lot more transaction activity out there. But the debt markets would be much more competitive. So that’s one thing to watch or if we just get a big double dip and the economy pull us down. But it’s a fairly active environment for people viewing their real estate as a source of capital today are very active.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber. Go ahead please.
Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus: First of all John, would you be able to comment a little bit further, in your press release a couple of weeks ago and you alluded to it again today about the 5% of rents that you were looking at. Can you just talk about what sectors you’ve seen, I guess, get the worse over the last six to nine months, and which ones would also have the tightest net coverage today?
John Case: Yeah, I think the tightest rent coverage you come back to casual dining and kind of the restaurant sector overall. And again, as I just said that’s where the margin compression is going on. So that’s kind of front and center as we look at it. And as we put that in there, we have a couple decent size exposures. But tenant gets into a lot of little ones. And so that wasn’t meant to be somebody at 5%, it could be one at 5%, two at 2.50%, and we just thought it was, it’s time to be a little more conservative in that area. But restaurants are kind of front and center, but when you get out of basic human needs, kind of a C-stores and the rest of it, it’s, I think their business is weakening a little bit and I was buoyed by things and higher GDP numbers but I’m not sure if I’m really believe them, we will see how that revise.
Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus: I mean, following on that would you say that most of the bankruptcies that we have seen year-to-date in casual dining have actually been a case of landlord so far is that trend starting to work a little bit?
Tom Lewis: What two are you referring to?
Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus: The Mexican dining with most of the markets, not necessarily in the Reality Income?
Tom Lewis: Oh, yes, yes, yes, there was Realmax and that’s (inaudible) and Falcao. We didn’t pay that much attention to it but they are kind of larger billings like that hurt a bit. It’s been a pretty good year as we said throughout the year was pretty quite out there. But, I think in the restaurant industry particularly you can see some more but so far it is been pretty good for the landlords and continued for us. We keep her running tall bankruptcies and if you look at the fourth quarter, I have only got four on my list and I have got five in the third quarter and before that there would be 8 or 10 or 12 in retail. So it’s been a fairly short list and so not a lot to work with recently. We think we will work out pretty well in the one we are working on and generally if you didn’t over paid too much it shouldn’t be that bad. So I don’t want to ring a bell that everything is getting negative it’s just, it’s really been nearly quite for about a year here in the portfolio and it was nice to see the economy come back a bit. But it’s not really running forward hard with some commodity price increases we just kind of saying somebody got to be impacted by this, if they are not able to pass through to the consumer ultimately those costs.
Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus: Well, I guess the fourth quarter is still young, so.
Tom Lewis: It’s still young.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman. Go ahead please.
Greg Schweitzer - Citigroup:  Hi, it’s Greg Schweitzer here with Michael, Citigroup. Tom, as you continue diversifying and increasing industry exposure to new areas apart from some key new hires is that anything new you are doing or investing in internally to better manage or handle the increase and improve core competency there?
Tom Lewis: Yes, I mean, we have hired people on research and then we have hired people that have background in those areas and we continue to work very hard on all of that a lot of it is just expanding a corporate underwriting, we have done for many years in retail and fortunately our people are – credit people being trained in and able to move outside of retail pretty good. The other area that we will down the road is portfolio management but that’s something that really comes later, we have 28 people in that department which is up substantially in the last 7, 8 years dealing with retail, so we would anticipate if you look for five years down the road, we will have to widen it there. But it’s really three, four people on acquisitions who have some background in that and then a couple of people in research.
Greg Schweitzer - Citigroup: Okay. And anything you could discuss related to the impact from Friendly's and the press is going on there?
Tom Lewis: Really not that much, I think just for anybody I think most people are aware that Friendly's filed a couple of weeks ago and we have 121 properties that are about 3.6% of rent. We bought starting 10 years ago 138 and 140 of those units we sold off a number of them which got us down to the 121 to-date. They filed rejected 15 properties which equates to about $1.3 million of rent which we will have now available to us to go back and release. But as its normal in these processes I think this is the 24th filing we have had since going public of this type and we’ve got fairly strong retention rates of rents up in the 80% and generally we feel pretty good about these processes, we have done a lot of them. But now we have to just wait and let it work. There kind of two issues that will go on. One is obviously as we work through this process there are some negotiation that goes on. So talking about what we would perceive as an eventual outcome is not probably the best strategy there. And then we found it very useful to try and stay very involved in the process and our General Counsel is Co-Chair of the Creditors Committee and obviously that requires non-disclosure agreements as it goes through the process in the Court of Delaware. But, as the Court decides anything that can be seen publicly and then over the next few quarters, if this works out we will fully report. We feel pretty good about the properties we own relative to the profitability of what we have paid and with expectations we’ll pretty well. And we did build that end of the disclosure as well as some assumptions that there would be other one next year.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya. Go ahead please.
Tayo Okusanya - UBS: Quick question if we were to come up with – if 2012 ends up being an Utopian World, where you don’t see a lot of retail bankruptcies, this and you take out this 5% of rent that you kind of put at risk in your2012 guidance, by how much would guidance grow up?
Unidentified Company Speaker: Well I think it’d probably go back up to where everybody pretty much have it before we first guided and which is lower, but as I’ve said earlier Tayo and there is one analyst I know who has talked about capital recycling a lot, which is you I think that’s something that’s coming up and the level and the amount of capital recycling we can do which I think does burn off some FFO, if things are better and there isn’t as much tenant activity and if acquisitions are a little higher I think we’d take the opportunity to do and then hopefully stay about where we are today. So I think that’s a – I can say it’s slower, but that was a message we are trying to give.
Tayo Okusanya - UBS: Okay so basically say things were better on the retail side, you may take it as an opportunity to divest a few more assets, and that include some dilutions in, net-net it would still kind of – you would still kind of end up where you are?
Unidentified Company Speaker: That would be our expectation.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of RJ Milligan. Please go ahead.
RJ Milligan - Raymond James: Tom, question for you on the 350 for next year in terms of acquisitions at least as a ballpark or the way to think about it, how much of that do you think is going to be non-retail or can you tell us how you think about that?
Tom Lewis: And John you want to comment relative to kind of transaction flow and legacy in [ph].
John Case: Yeah, I will tell you sort of what we are currently seeing right now is predominantly retail and we are seeing in queue investment grade distribution centers, but we would expect obviously based on what we are seeing now 80% of our acquisitions next year could be retail oriented acquisitions in our traditional industries and property types. But that can change with one large significant portfolio.
RJ Milligan - Raymond James: Yeah, as you predict.
John Case: Yeah if you look at this year its kind of interesting, 55% of what we’ve acquired to-date is retail, 21% distribution, 17% office, 6% manufacturing and 1% to 2% industrial. But the vast majority of that came through that one transaction with ECM and its interesting thus over the last quarter or two, we thought we could see moderation in the number of kind of traditional retail transactions come up and they are actually accelerating a bit, so we have to take this transaction flow right now and look forward, it would be heavily retail or the smattering of some investment grade in other areas, but as John said one transaction can change that.
RJ Milligan - Raymond James: Is there a specific non-retail property type that’s more attractive to you or is it just the credit quality?
Unidentified Company Speaker: It’s well – it’s very much credit quality when we move outside of retail because in retail you can have the four walled EBITDA cash flow coverage, which can give you a lot of protection even when working with some weaker tenants and when you get outside of retail you can get at a case only, but it’s a little harder to tie down, so we think its absolutely necessary to go up the curve and then kind of our greatest comfort level to-date relative to the other areas has been distribution. As we’ve done with Diageo there is a fair amount of the agriculture that you see ended up 4.6%, its pretty much all the Diageo. That’s very comfortable, that’s a function of where it is and who the tenant is. So I would say tenant first and going up the credit curve to investment grade and when we get outside of retail and that’s our intention and distribution most comfortable out of - of that group and probably manufacturing industrial after that, probably office last.
Operator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik. Go ahead please.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Securities: Just a question, I guess is the plan still to get up to sort of 20% to 30% of the portfolio in non-retail over the medium term?
Unidentified Company Speaker: Yeah that - for us that’s a ballpark four to five year feeling and its one of those things or once you are – well that’s what’s the objective and so 20% is a good initial number, when we are off to a good start, but it is so underwriting specific that the number could freeze where it is if we weren’t able to pull good investment grade stuff in, but if we were able to pull investment grade in then higher would be okay too because there is a strong desire to do two things right now, one is when working within retail to have even higher cash flow coverages up above 2.5 where I think over the last few years its been in the 2.3 million to 2.5 million, and or go up the credit curve. And that’s really a function of looking forward and understanding in the last 20 years that a lot of these less and less NAREIT retailers have to wend at their back if you were in a declining interest rate environment. And if you look forward we’re fairly close to zero to-date in interest rates. And so the expectation that you might have see a higher interest rates in the future, were kind of undertaking a big project to look at the impact for all of our tenants, if they had to refinance their balance sheets over five to ten year period at 300 basis points higher in permanent financing costs and 600 basis points higher. So to the extent that we’re working on retail, we would like higher coverages and to the extent we can, we would like to go up the credit curve whether it’s in or out of retail.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Securities: Okay. And as you get some of those higher credit tenants in the portfolio does that change your outlook on your use of leverage at all?
Tom Lewis: At the moment, not right now, I think we’re okay to use leverage right now. We’ve been reducing it a bit as you’ve seen debt fall from about 35% down to 27%, 28%. But we’re more focused on the maturities of that. If you start again worrying about interest rates over five to ten years, you look at your maturity schedule. So we’re fine adding debt like we did earlier in the year, where we opened up $150 million of our 2035. So we’re comfortable with more leverage, a little bit more leverage. So if we’re going to do, we would like the duration to be fairly lengthy, but don’t want it to get too high.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Securities: Okay. So in terms of sort of an average leverage that we could look at historically it probably wouldn’t increase much even though you will have higher credit tenants on thereafter?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, we put, the Board put a policy in 1994 when we went public, 17 years ago, that we didn’t want leverage debt over 35% kind of gross assets, market cap, and we didn’t want preferred over 10% and we stayed inside of that and that hasn’t changed.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Securities: Okay, great. Thanks. And probably looking forward to see you in Chicago in a couple of weeks and get our management behind (inaudible) conference.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Moore. Please go ahead.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Following up on that for a second, knowing how much you guys hit at, should we think in terms of you guys clearing of the acquisition line here, given the market was up gigantic today, if it keeps going like this, I mean clearing with common equity at some point or do you have to wait until to gets maybe it gets say half full something like that?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, generally we would like it to get up $150 million plus before we do something. And we just did a fair amount of equity, we’ve done kind of four in the last year, it’s just under $1 billion, and well the prices were very good and they were very accretive transaction relative to the impact to cash flow. And we’re not in a hurry to rush into one right now. And so we would like to do some additional acquisitions build the line of debt and then watch for things go. We took the opportunity this year to add to the equity base substantially.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, good. Thanks. And then, I want to go back for a second to your comments Tom about, about getting rid of stuff, as times get better. I mean it sounds like you look at different segments of what you have maybe consumer discretionary or casual dining as a whole group that’s something you might get rid of maybe do a portfolio transaction that’s a couple of hundred properties is that how we should think about that?
Tom Lewis: My sense is, is in this business when you have a large portfolio and you’re trying to put it out and at the best price. You do that better on a one-off basis kind as you go along one at a time. That was our experience we learned from Crest, when we bought 30, 40 at a time, put them out one at a time, and that’s how we would probably want to do it. So we’ve got, out of the tenant base, maybe 70 tenants of decent size, and we’re going through and passing them very carefully given a lot of metrics, and refinance the balance sheet and how we feel about the industry and our position with them and how much debt when it comes to a wide variety of metrics. And then rating from top to bottom, and if you put them into kind of four quartiles and looked at the bottom quartile, you would say cheap. We’re going to be lovely five to ten years from now those one in the portfolio, and then you’ve to look at your growth rates and making sure you deliver for the investors, while you’re doing it, and to the extent that acquisitions are good, the portfolio performs, you can do that at accelerated rate. And that if it doesn’t maybe at a little slower rate. So I think it will be just picking out really a group of tenants in the lower quartile and then there is a separate project we have to take all 2600 properties and put a rating on them for the market they’re in, for what we paid, for what the cash flow coverages are, how much we’ve less than lease, and when you marry those two together, ultimately they become a mix of tenant and property, but over the coming years we would like to accelerate those sales but it will be a function of how much we can do and still maintain a decent growth rate and dividend growth.
Richard Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, okay. But the lower quartile is about 650 properties. So we should think maybe if you really get going on this you could do 100 in a year, is that what’s you’re thinking?
Tom Lewis: I think it’s possible, but I don’t think that’s in the cards at all for 2012 and that’s probably aggressive for 2013. But it will all depend on the growth rate, because if you’re adding a lot, on the high credit side, it gives you a lot of flexibility to still pose pretty good numbers and accelerate it. But there were years in Crest, where I think we had $130 million as inventory in 2007 and we got it all out of the door in about a year. And those were in right sized properties of $1 million to $2 million. So we’ve done it before, but I wouldn’t look forward to ’12, because we’re still crunching the numbers and in the middle of the analysis.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Todd Stender. Go ahead please.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities: Your assumptions for next year Tom you’re talking about interest rates picking up, does that mean initial lease yields they just go or is there a longer lag maybe that’s more of 2013 event just in your estimations?
Tom Lewis: Great question. I would assume if our guys lag, because that’s almost always what happen, you’ll start seeing your line cost rising, and we -- it hasn’t been happening but we put I think 10 basis points in for it to go up on a regular basis. And so your line cost go first, your permanent financing cost go second, and the net lease cap rates tend to lag, that’s true on the way up and the way down. So for modeling for us or anybody in the business that be our best cap that’s what we’ve seen over the years.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities: Thanks. And the ECM deal it came with some secured debt. Do you have your sale with that right now; if you sell a portfolio would that be a deal breaker, what’s -- what are your comments on that?
Tom Lewis: Well I think, Paul said $64 million or $68 million.
Paul Meurer: $67 million.
Tom Lewis: $67 million. There was $90 million we thought we would be left with, but we’ve been to pair that down. And so $67 million you said. So we’re about $67 million above where we would like to be. And but that doesn’t mean we wouldn’t if a portfolio came in and have some secured debt, we take it, but as we do hit here, we will do our debt immediately to payoff everything that we can payoff without it being just a huge economic drain, and then paying off the balance as fast as we can. So we don’t want to say it will preclude us from doing a portfolio, but at the same time we’re not looking to add it, and we would like to get rid of it as soon as we can. We like a unsecured balance sheet strategy.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities: As far as your underwriting new deals are rent coverages being adjusted higher as well then you have less visibility on how the company cash flows are going to look, next 18, 24 months?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, if you look at the cash flow coverages on our recent purchases they’ve been 20, 30, 40 basis points higher than the last few years. So you’re really looking up in the very high twos as where we’re pointing into the threes if we can get it. But, and it changes from industry to industry but we’ve been trying to really adjust that up because that’s the kind of lesson that’s investment grade retail and then obviously up in the other areas we’re looking for investment grade credit.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back to Mr. Tom Lewis for any closing comments.
Tom Lewis: Thank you very much. I know it’s a busy earning season and we appreciate the time spent and look forward to seeing many of you coming up at NAREIT some other function. Thank you very much and thank you Joe.

===== 2011 Q2  (2011-07-28 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Tom Lewis - CEO Gary Malino - President and COO Paul Meurer - EVP and CFO John Case - EVP and CIO Mike Pfeiffer - EVP and General Counsel
Analysts: Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus Lindsay Schroll - Bank of America Michael Bilerman - Citi Todd Lukasik - Morningstar Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets RJ Milligan - Raymond James Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities
Operator: Welcome to the Realty Income second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. (Operator instructions) I'd like to inform everyone that this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, July 28, 2011 at 1:30 pm Pacific Center Time. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income.
Tom Lewis: Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on the call to discuss our second quarter of this year. With me as usual is Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; John Case, our EVP and Chief Investment Officer; Mike Pfeiffer, our EVP and General Counsel. And during this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in the forward-looking statements. And we will disclose in greater detail on the company's Form 10-Q the factors that may cause such differences. And with that, as is our custom, we'll let Paul start with some discussion of the numbers.
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Tom. As usual, I'll just briefly walk through the financial statements and provide a few highlights of the financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 24.5% to $102.6 million this quarter versus $82.4 million during the second quarter of 2010. This reflects the significant amount of new acquisitions over the past year as well as positive same-store rent increases for the quarterly period of 1.8%. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $5.7 million in the comparative quarterly period, and of course depreciation expense increased as our property portfolio continues to grow. Interest expense increased by just over $4 million. This increase was due to the $250 million of senior notes due 2021 which we issued in June of last year and our recent issuance of $150 million of notes in the reopening of our 2035 bonds. One of related note, our coverage ratio has both improved since last quarter with interest coverage now at 3.6 times and fixed charge coverage now at 2.9 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the second quarter were $7.987 million. As we've mentioned over the past year, these comparative increases in G&A are due partly to recent hirings and our acquisition in research departments. Our G&A expense has increased as our acquisition activity has increased and we've invested in some new personnel for future growth. Furthermore and specific to this quarter, this quarter's G&A was also impacted by the expensing of $542,000 of acquisition due diligence cost. That compares to a similar number of our category of $40,000 of acquisition due diligence cost in the comparative quarter a year ago. Our current projection for G&A for the year for 2011 is approximately $29.5 million, which will represent only about 7% of total revenues. This is only a slight increase from the $29 million estimate we gave you last quarter for the year, the additional $500,000 reflecting of course this $500,000 of unique acquisition expenses during the second quarter. Property expenses remained flat at $1.656 million for the quarter. These expenses are primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance and insurance expenses, which we are responsible for on properties available for lease. And our current estimate for 2011 remains about $7 million. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company. They were $368,000 during the quarter. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled just under $1.3 million. Real estate acquired for resale refers to the operations of Crest Net Lease, our subsidiary that can acquire and resell properties. Crest, however, did not acquire or sell any properties in the quarter and overall contributed income of $220,000. Real estate held-for-investment refers to property sales by realty income from our existing core portfolio. We sold six properties during the quarter, resulting overall income of just over $1 million. These property sales gains are not included in our FFO or in the calculation of our AFFO. Preferred stock cash dividends remained at $6.1 million for the quarter and net income available to common stockholders increased to approximately $33.2 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO increased 30.1% to $60.9 million for the quarter. An on a per share basis, FFO pare share increased 6.7% to $0.48 for the quarter. Adjusted funds from operation or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividend was higher at $0.49 per share for the quarter. Our AFFO is usually higher than our FFO, because our capital expenditures are fairly low and we have minimal straight line rent in our portfolio. We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter. We have increased the dividend 55 consecutive quarters and 62 times overall since we went public over 15.5 years ago. Our dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 90% of our FFO and 88% of our AFFO. Now turning to the balance sheet for a minute, we've continued to maintain a very conservative and safe capital structure. Our current debt to total market capitalization is only 28%, and our preferred stock outstanding represents just 5% of our capital structure. We did assume mortgage debt of approximately $60 million on three properties we acquired during the quarter. We plan to repay these mortgages at the earliest economically-feasible prepayment date. All details regarding these mortgages can be found in the 10-Q to be filed shortly. In June, we raised $150 million of new capital with the reopening of our 2035 bonds. Since some of the identified acquisitions we have did not close in the second quarter, we ended up with $156 million of cash on hand at June 30, and we estimate of course using that cash for acquisitions during the third quarter. We also have zero borrowings on our $425 million credit facility, and we have no debt maturities until 2013. So in summary, we currently have excellent liquidity and our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and safe. Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom who will give you a little bit more background on these results.
Tom Lewis: Let me start with the portfolio. Obviously the metrics for the second quarter for the portfolio were very good and operations continued to improve pretty much across the portfolio. At the end of the quarter, as you can see in the release, 15 largest tenants accounted for about 52% of revenue. That's down 180 basis points from last quarter and about 260 basis points for the year. So obviously additional sources of revenue have given us some added diversification. And the average cash flow coverage rent at the store level for the top 15 tenants remained very stable at about 2.35 times. So overall a very good metric. Occupancy in second quarter was 97.3% and 68 properties available for lease, and that's out of the 2,523 properties we own. That's up 50 basis points from the first quarter and about 110 basis points versus same period a year ago. For the quarter, we had only two new vacancies. That's obviously versus 10 in the first quarter and we leased or sold 15 properties during the quarter and I think added 10 to the portfolio. And that's the reason for the increase in occupancy, but obviously at 97.3% very healthy. My sense is we should probably look for the portfolio to operate at about this level going forward. I think with the normal amount of rollover and other activities in the portfolio, and ebb and flow a bit around this number, but as we really look at our internal projections for the balance of the year, it may go up a bit next quarter. But I think this is around where we would anticipate being at the end of the year and back to where we were a few years ago, before we went into the recession. And obviously at this level, we're pleased with that. Same-store rents from the portfolio increased 1.8% during the second quarter. That's compared to 1.1% in the first quarter and then 1% in the fourth last year and 0.3% in the third quarter. So we've kind seen as expected. That number continued to increase, and we get up to about 1.8% to 2%. That tends to be on the high end for Realty Income being a net lease company and pretty healthy for us. If you look at the same-store rents, kind of where they came from, we had only one industry where we had decline in same-store rents in the quarter, and that was some quick-service restaurants which declined only about $109,000. We have four industries where we have same-store rent flat and then 25 saw same-store rent increases with very healthy increases, primarily from the movie theatres and then surprisingly but very nice CRV vehicle dealerships that we have in the portfolio and then some added in as usual, convenient stores and automotive stores, for a net gain there of about $1.4 million overall in the portfolio. Obviously, the occupancy gains and same-store rent increases over the last four quarters have been very healthy and the portfolio continues to do very well. Just a comment on diversification. We continue to widen that out as we add new industries and tenants. Basically we are now I think 2,523 properties and 37 different industries and 131 multiple-unit tenants in 49 states. The industry exposures are moving around a bit, and we remain very diversified. Convenient stores remain our largest at 19%. That's down about 90 basis points from last quarter. Restaurants continue to come down as we've been working on that for the last couple of years. It's down to about 17.5% of revenue. That's down 140 basis points from last quarter and about 440 basis points over the last four, five quarters. And we think that will continue. I also want to point out one of the things, one of the charts is on industry diversification that we have in the press release, and we're often asked of the restaurants in the portfolio, how much are QSR, quick service restaurants, or fast food and how many are casual dining. So we went ahead this quarter and broke those out and really broke them into two segments. We still do that. Industry of restaurants is being one industry that we want to keep below 20% rent, but we thought we'd break it out, and we hope that's helpful. Behind that, theaters is our next largest industry at 7.8% and then the only other categories that really come in over 5% are automotive tire stores at 6.3%, beverages at 5.7% and then child day care at 5.4%, which interestingly I would note that 5.4% in child care was 50% of the portfolio when we became public a number of years ago. So we remain in good shape and trying to improve on diversification. Our largest tenant is Diageo at 5.4%, and then as you see in the chart, LA Fitness and AMC behind that. And with all 15 of our largest tenants really contribution a smaller percentage of revenue, it's widening out. When you get to the 15th largest tenant, as you can see here, it's 2.1%. When you get to the 20th, you're below 1.5%. And then it goes down pretty quickly under there. And again, geographically we remain fairly well diversified. Average lease length on the portfolio at the end of the quarter was 11.1 years. So that's very healthy and remains strong. And I think overall a very good quarter for portfolio operations. Let me move on to property acquisitions. During the second quarter, we continued to be active. We acquired 10 properties for $213 million. The average lease yield or cap rate on those in the quarter was 7.5%, average lease term about 13 year. And the 10 properties that we bought are leased to eight different tenants. Those different tenants are in seven different industries. I would note that of the $213.5 million that we acquired, approximately $206 million was part of the $544 million transaction that we announced in the first quarter. So if you look at that $544 million without $130 million in the first quarter, $206 million here in the second quarter gets us to $336 million and leaves us with another $208 million of that transaction to close in the third quarter. And we believe all of it will close by the end of the third quarter. For the first six months, that gets us to $364 million at a 7.6% cap rate. If you then add in $208 million I just mentioned that should close in the third quarter, that should get us really about $564 million for the year at probably around a 7.8% a cap overall. We think we'll continue to add to that. Right now, for our planning purposes, we're using $600 million to $800 million in acquisitions for the year at around 8% cap rate or so. And that's what kind of underlies our guidance. That obviously would be another good year for us for acquisitions. Let's talk about cap rates for a moment. The cap rate for the quarter was a bit lower than usual at 7.5%, but that was due primarily to the fact that the portion of the $544 million transaction, that $206 million of the $213 million we bought this quarter, had really a cluster of the highest credit tenants in that transaction. So we were very much working up to credit curve in the quarter, and the properties we closed were with tenants like MeadWestvaco, T-Mobile, FedEx and Coca Cola. And obviously, when you're working up to credit curve with those type of tenants, the rates are lower and they just happen to be clustered into the closings this quarter. And that's why a little bit lower rate. So I think we'd look for cap rates to increase a bit on the assets that we acquire in the balance of the year. That's true in the third quarter for the $206 million remaining in this transaction and I think also for the other things that we're working on. So I think out in the marketplace, while cap rates remain very competitive, the lower cap rates so far this year are just primarily a factor of working out the credit curve. And the majority of what we'll closed in the third quarter and I think beyond would likely be 50 basis points higher or more than what we did this quarter. And that should probably get us to about an 8 cap by the end of the year give or take 10 basis points or 20 basis points. But that's really where that came from. Talking about the acquisitions market overall right now, we continue to see a very good flow of acquisition opportunities to work on. Transaction flow is very healthy and has continued to increase really since about the second quarter of 2010. And so there are a lot of transactions. And we're very busy in underwriting, and also the majority of what we are looking on as in our traditional retail net lease areas at the moment. And there is quite a bit going on. However, it is also a very competitive market. There is a lot of capital flushing around, looking for a home, and a lot of it is also in the triple net lease market. And so while it's very competitive, that leads I think some of the transactions to be a little loosely structured. So I'm trying to figure out exactly what we'll be able to close even though there is a fairly high level of transactions that we're looking is a bit difficult. But even at these cap rates, given cost of capital, obviously spreads remain very good, and it's a good environment to the extent that we can continue to find good things to buy. Let me move to guidance for a minute. Obviously, the acquisitions and increasing occupancy and same-store rent have increased our revenue and FFO and AFFO numbers, and we think that will continue to be the case for the balance of the year and I think in the next year. But in the release, as you can see, we took a couple of cents off the top end of the guidance, and that was really due to three things, the first of which is, as I mentioned, some of the closings on the $544 million transaction held back by a few months due to some of the issues related to assuming mortgages on those properties. And that's a process that is fairly new for us. Additionally, some of those where properties with mortgages that we thought we might assume for a couple of month until we had a chance to totally pay them off, but as it turned out, as we run through the transaction, there were some fees and costs with lenders for the assumption that we just decided it wasn't economic to take. And if we just waited a couple of months to close those, if we could under the contract, we can just pay those mortgages off. And so those moved into the mid-to-light third quarter on that $206 million. And obviously, the revenue we'd have started booking somewhere in the second quarter was put off for a quarter or so. The second thing that we did is obviously elected to move into the bond market, open up our 30-year and raise $150 million of capital with 24-year debt offering. We thought the rate was attractive. The market was open. And notwithstanding that we knew we didn't need the money right away, we knew we'd need it by the end of the summer. But having that cash on hand was also contributory. And then Paul finally mentioned that there was about $550,000 of additional G&A from direct transaction cost, and then there was also really another $200,000 in G&A that was not research or due diligence costs, but just cost relative to some legal fees and other things and state fees that directly related also to those acquisitions. So there is about $750,000 there in G&A. And the net effect of the three of those together is responsible for taking $0.02 off the top of the guidance. So I hope that's helpful. For the year then, we're estimating FFO of $198 million to $202 million. That's about 8.2% to 10.4% FFO growth. And AFFO of $203 million to $205 million, that's 9% to 10% AFFO growth. And obviously that should allow us to continue to grow the dividend and at same time bring the payout ratio down quite a bit. At this point in the year, if acquisitions accelerate further, that would add to the numbers to some extent for this year. But obviously as we're sitting here in the third quarter and you look at acquisitions and as they close later in the year, it'd be more additive to next year's numbers as we buy in the third and fourth quarter. I'll just finish. Paul mentioned the balance sheet, which in very good shape and we're very liquid and have capital to move forward and do additional acquisitions. And so to summarize, it was a very, very good quarter for the portfolio. We continue to be active in acquisitions, and revenue, FFO and AFFO grew nicely, but should continue to grow. And with that, if we can, we'll open it up to any questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel Nicolaus.
Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus: I guess from a high-level view, how would you guys think of growth versus portfolio sales going forward as the portfolio is getting now close to $4 billion? I guess there has to be some additional if you really want to make future accretive acquisitions. Do you guys think about either pairing back to portfolio on some of the lower-quality stuff, or do you think that the primary growth is going to come from acquisitions going forward?
Tom Lewis: I would hope over the long-term, given how we structured the leases, there is probably 1.5% to 2% internal growth from same-store rent increases given a kind of flat occupancy. And so you're right. Majority of the rest of growth really has to come externally. And as we get larger now and if you're looking at 5% FFO growth in the next year, you're probably looking at about $700 million of acquisitions. Unfortunately, even though while we've grown, it is a very large net lease market, of which we hold a very small share. So I think we can continue to grow. With that said, one of the things that I was really trying to focus on, it's likely not to have as much impact this year, but going into next year and the following is really doing what you said, which is we have a project underway to go through the portfolio and kind of look at each of the properties and rate them 1 through 2,500-plus relative to what we think the long-term risk is, return. And that's a project that's ongoing, and we're going to marry that also with the tenant review. And kind of taking a look, as we look forward five, 10 years, given we've had 30 years of declining interest rates and almost to zero, kind of how we view the tenants relative to their operations, but also if they had to go out and refinance their balance sheets, which most will, and the combination of those two will lead us probably in the next year and the year after to work on some portfolio sales. And while I don't think it will be massive, I think it will step up continuously what we're selling off. And that may be partially with fund acquisitions, but I still believe that new assets will be responsible for our growth primarily in the next three, four years.
Joshua Barber - Stifel Nicolaus: You also touched before on the 1031 market before. Have you seen any additional demand coming from that market or it's still been sort of sleepy like it's been the last year or so?
Tom Lewis: As it was a few years ago, it's very sleepy, because obviously the one thing you have to have is a gain. You need a 1031. But as we've seen cap rates falling, prices rise, there is a little more activity in the 1031 market out there. And absent the volatility you are seeing, we are watching potentially in the financial markets today, it is a time where there probably would be some opportunities for sales coming there. That's fine for selling out of the portfolio relative to adding assets and starting Crest back up. Given the potential volatility, I am not quite sure I'd do it yet. But if things continue and reach the low, then there probably will be additional demand coming on from the 1031 market on one-off transactions. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Lindsay Schroll of Bank of America.
Lindsay Schroll - Bank of America: I am not sure what those three remaining Crest properties are, but I guess is there any thought that you'd dispose of those three assets and get rid of Crest all together?
Tom Lewis: I don't think we'd get rid of Crest all together. I think there may be a time of the future when we could use it again, although I don't know in how much volume. But to give you an idea, Crest at its peak when we had well over $100 million inventory, there was approximately two employees in Crest, and the person that was the professional there is still with us and is doing a lot of our good acquisition work. And the other person has really transferred aside. So Crest has no employees, and really the only expenses that we have there is a little bit of tax and bookkeeping. The three assets that we hold in there are assets that wrote down quite a bit. They were the three Hometown Buffet, and I think they're carrying value. We're more focused now out of leasing them and hope to have some progress there and then decide what to do with them. And then there is also a couple of other assets in Crest that are generating income. I mean these are mortgages taking back, taking back at a fairly low loan to value ratio from a couple of sales we did. So there is very little cost in Crest, but there is some revenue coming in there right now, and we may use them it again some day. So it's not a huge carrying cost.
Lindsay Schroll - Bank of America: What is really driving the higher level of opportunities that you're seeing?
Tom Lewis: I think M&A is back on the table, and we've started to see that heat up. And I also think that there are a number of investments banks that have been talking to their clients about taking advantage of what is a bit of a resurgent market relative to net lease properties. The flow has just continued to pick up. It kind of flattened out in the first quarter. But as we sit here today, I know the flow we're seeing from investment banks, directly from retailers and then the private equity firms has increased quite a bit. So that's basically it. But the volumes have increased and there is a lot out there. And I think I used a line on the last call that Odds are good, but the goods are odd. Given kind of animal spirit reemerging back into the marketplace, some of these are structured at prices and cap rates that don't make sense for us, and there are a lot of players out there. But I think some of them are getting end up in our sweet spot and we'd be able to do some more, but it is very active.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi.
Michael Bilerman - Citi: Can you guys talk a little bit about the general health of the retail environment? You had a good uptick in occupancy this quarter. Has anything changed from the leasing discussions recently that led to that, or is it just sort of a gradual improvement?
Tom Lewis: First, in lease rollover, we had some pretty good results. I think we had 86 properties to do at the start of the year. 40 of them are done and had pretty good results in there. And so there wasn't really incoming on from that. And there is not a lot of tenant activity in terms of getting anything back. And people during the second quarter, first quarter felt better about leasing space to smaller tenants and growing their businesses. And I don't want to sound like it's a great retail environment, but I think over the last 30 days or so, people are a little more cautious. But I hear in the third quarter, I think the activity is going to be pretty good.
Michael Bilerman - Citi: Do you have an internal estimate as to when you think the mortgages will be paid off?
Tom Lewis: The other thing is I'm also speaking most of what we have the smaller box-type space. I'm not sure if that's true for the larger box. So I'll just take that caveat.
Paul Meurer: We'll give all the details in the Q, but just so you know, it's four different mortgages on three different properties aggregating about $58.6 million. And we will be paying those off somewhere between 2013 and 2015. That's the earliest very economically-feasible prepayment date.
Tom Lewis: And I think when we first announced our transaction, we thought we might have $90 million, $92 million in mortgages, but we were able to work on that and get it down to about a little under $60 million.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik with Morningstar.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: You talked a little bit about the retail environment. It sounds like it's still pretty healthy. I think in the last couple of quarters, there've been no tenants on the credit watch list. Is that still the case?
Tom Lewis: Yes, there is nobody on the credit watch list, which we think if anything is imminent. Particularly over the last three to four months, if you look at those that really work with kind of low income, those are the people that continue to suffer. We paint a picture generally, but most of our businesses came back really well, but there are a few guys there still working very hard, but nothing that we see is imminent.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: You mentioned the cash flow coverage of rent, Tom. Do you have the range for the top 15 tenants?
Tom Lewis: Yes, I do. It's about the same as last quarter, 1.5% to 3.5%.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: And with regards to the direct transaction cost, should we think about those as costs for already agreed to acquisitions or costs related to potential future acquisitions or a combination of the two?
Tom Lewis: I'd say it's primarily associated with acquisitions that either closed or in the process of closing. You need kind of diligence costs on unique property types as well as unique work you need to do on in-placed leases, if you will, things of that nature. And you have a large portfolio.
Todd Lukasik - Morningstar: And then my last question just with regard to dividends, coverage is obviously improving. If the Board thinks about a dividend increase in the third quarter, can you just give us some idea around what type of metrics they will be looking at to set a possible dividend increase?
Tom Lewis: I think we have been steadily increasing it in the last few years, small amounts on a quarterly basis. That's particularly as revenue and FFO flattened out during the recession. And so this is going to be a bit of a catch-up going on getting the payout ratio back down in the 80s. I think by the end of the year, we will have done that. And so my sense is, although this is going to be a subject of our Board meeting, that it wouldn't be a bad idea to have just a full increases this year. But in next year, probably dividend increases would be much closer to matching up FFO growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company.
Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company: Recently, you guys have been doing more deals with higher credit tenants, got much lower cap rates. But when we think about just the overall competitive environment, as you mentioned, cap rates keep going down, how should we be thinking about your appetite if you're doing deals at pretty tough cap rates? Should we be kind of thinking about you guys are going down or you guys still would be in very competitive, but maybe levering up the balance sheet (inaudible) and end up with a decent spread on those deals?
Tom Lewis: Even though rates in the last couple of years have fallen, the spreads have been the widest they have ever been since we've been in business. Again, working on credit curve, we are really looking around 8 cap rates on what we're doing. And an 8 cap rate in this cost to capital environment is a pretty good rate. Relative to levering up, I'm not sure that we want to take balance sheet metrics much further out than they are. And like you saw us two quarters or so ago, to the extent we would do it, we'd probably want to do it in very long-term paper. With rates near zero, I think the odds in the next five to 10 years for interest rates to be a little higher or decent, I'm not sure you want to add on to your balance sheet intermediate and short-term financing. You're going to refinance at higher rates. So I think it will be a combination from equity, maybe a little preferred, maybe a little debt, and then on an accelerated basis, but not the majority from outside recycling as we move into the next couple of years or so.
Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company: Are there any retail categories that you guys would be more interested in increasing exposure to or decreasing exposure to going forward?
Tom Lewis: In the retail area, we continue to like the convenience stores. We're probably pretty heavy there, but we can do some more. The casual dining restaurant is not an area that we'd want to go to, but quick service is a nice solid business if we could get the right tenant. And then movie theaters, we like theaters quite a bit. That's always of interest to us and still under 10%. And then kind of outside of that, in the other areas that newly went into, the transportation, FedEx type tenants are some that if we can be additive there and get a cap rate that makes sense, we wouldn't mind doing it. But it's pretty broad-based. It really has more to do with the particular transaction, cash flow coverage into our credit and the prices and cap rate that we can get rather than saying, "Hey, this is the industry we want to go after."
Tayo Okusanya - Jefferies & Company: You've had the Diageo deal under your belt for a bit now. Just how that's going relative to your initial thoughts?
Tom Lewis: Absolutely great. They are a great tenant, obviously a very, very good credit, and their business continues to move forward. And we have Diageo on the lease for a very long time. I think we added on Hewitt as the number one, another one of their wineries such as Sterling and BV and both are doing well. As a leader of the wine sector, strongly recommended, 2007 Georges De Latour. 90 points.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets: Can you comment on what type of tenants have been active in leasing your Vegan properties?
Tom Lewis: It's pretty broad-based. A lot of this was smaller, some of the childcare and restaurant that we added over the years. So it's been a combination of local tenants, primarily or small three, four, five, six-unit chains. And that's why you've kind of more sales than leases, but pretty broad-based. We've been out there really working hard beating the bushes. One of the advantages of having smaller units is you have the opportunity to work with some smaller organizations. And then it's a question if you're more comfortable keeping them in the portfolio and selling them. But it really is a lot of two, three, four-unit people that look at the current opportunity and see an opportunity to expand. I really give credit to our people in portfolio management. They have been very active and very successful this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of RJ Milligan with Raymond James.
RJ Milligan - Raymond James: Tom, just curious if we're seeing any change in terms of the mix of where the capital is coming from, looking for the triple net assets and maybe if some of the recent economic data points have changed that mix.
Tom Lewis: The private REIT space, which is getting a lot of pressure today, there has been a couple of people there that have been expanding, and that just seems to be the asset class they've moved to mix. So there is a fair amount coming from that end of it as well as the public companies being active. And then there is also some kind of real estate private equity that's out. Even some of the mortgage people that are unable to get the yields they want in their business have been opening up some shops to do this. So it just happened three, four, or five times since we have been public, and there is just a lot of people looking moving into this space right now as they see falling cap rates in another areas, trying to get some yield. So it's pretty broad-based and it's very active, but we think we'll get our appropriate share of the business.
RJ Milligan - Raymond James: So there is still pretty strong demand from the smaller owners, the more local guys?
Tom Lewis: There is a demand for buying triple-net leases. The 1031 market has picked up a bit. But it's a lot of larger transaction stuff. As we all know, a lot of money on the streets flushing around and some of it's looking to net lease given where the yields are today.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo Securities.
Todd Stender - Wells Fargo Securities: Building of the ECM portfolio, do you find yourself in more conversations for deals and the FedEx-type acquisition opportunities or it really still too early to see any flow from that yet?
Tom Lewis: I think it's too early to see flow on a current quarter, but we're in a lot of discussions there, and we're kind of adding to our efforts in that area, because we think it'd be very good place to go. If one of your views is interest rates could be higher in the future, we look back on some of the lower rated tenants and some of their success may have come from the low interest rate environment over a prolonged period of time, so moving up the credit curve over the next five to 10 years is not a bad place to be. So we are putting more effort there. And it's some nice discussions with some very large corporations just about how they view the world, and we hope going into the next year that that will be additive. The initial moves we had here with some industrial and distribution and manufacturing was really a function of the two transactions, Diageo and then secondarily the ECM. But now we're trying to get granular with those people. But as is it when you go into a new line here, it's going to take a year or two or three. We'll have better clarity of exactly what's going be, but we're active.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. This concludes the question-and-answer session for the Realty Income conference call. Mr. Lewis, please continue.
Tom Lewis: As always, thank you very much for the attention. We appreciate it and we look forward to talking to you again at one of the industry meetings or in the next 90 days when we do this again. Thanks so much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. Please disconnect your lines.

Paul Meurer: Thanks, Tom. As usual, I’ll provide some comments and brief highlights of our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. And our total revenue increased 18.4% to $97.8 million this quarter versus $82.6 million during the first quarter of 2010. Obviously, this reflected the significant amount of new acquisitions over the past year, as well as some positive same-store rent increases for the quarterly period of 1.1%. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by almost $3.8 million in a comparative quarterly period, as depreciation expense obviously has increased as our property portfolio continues to grow. Interest expense increased by just over $3.7 million, and this increase was due to the $250 million of senior notes due 2021, which we’ve issued in June of last year. On a related note, our coverage ratios both improved since last quarter with interest coverage now at 3.5 times and fixed charge coverage now at 2.8 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the first quarter was $7,870,000, as we’ve mentioned over the past couple of quarters the increase in G&A recently is due largely to recent hiring in our acquisitions and research department. Our G&A expense has increased as our acquisition activity has increased, and as we have invested in new personnel for future growth. Furthermore though, this quarters G&A was also impacted by the expensing of $371,000 of acquisitions due diligence cost mostly related to the large portfolio acquisition that we announced last month. Our current projection for G&A for 2011 is approximately $29 million, which will represent less than 7% of our total revenue. Property expenses were $1,983,000 for the quarter. And of course these expenses are primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance and insurance expenses, which we are responsible for on properties available for lease. Our current estimate for 2011 is approximately $7 million for property expenses. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company. They were $350,000 during the quarter. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $396,000. Real estate acquired for resale refers to the operations of Crest Net Lease, our subsidiary that acquires and resells properties. Crest did not acquire or sell any properties in the quarter and overall contributed income from discontinued operations of $222,000. Real estate held-for-investment refers to property sales by realty income from our existing core portfolio. We sold three properties during the first quarter resulting overall in income of approximately $174,000. These property sales gains are not included in our FFO or in the calculation of our AFFO. Preferred stock cash dividends remained at $6.1 million for the quarter and net income available to common stock holders increased to approximately $29.9 million for the quarter. Net income or funds from operations or FFO increased 21.2% to $56.6 million for the quarter. On a per share basis, FFO increased 6.7% to $0.48 for the quarter. Adjusted funds from operation or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividend was a penny higher at $0.49 per share for the quarter. Our AFFO is usually higher than our FFO because our capital expenditures are fairly low and we have minimal straight line rent in our portfolio. We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter. We have increased the dividend 54 consecutive quarters and 61 times overall since we went public 15.5 years ago. And our dividend payout ratio has now continued to decrease, for the quarter was 90% of our FFO and about 88% of our AFFO. Turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain a very conservative and safe capital structure. Our current debt to total market capitalization is only 25% and our prepared stock outstanding represents just 5% of our capital structure. In March we successfully raised $300 million of new common equity in order to finance new property acquisitions. Since many of these acquisition did not close in the first quarter. We had $130 million of cash on hand at March 31st. We also have zero borrowings on a $425 million credit facility and we had no debt maturities until 2013. So, in summary, we currently have excellent liquidity, and our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and safe. Now let me turn the call back over to Tom, who’ll give you a little bit more background on these results.
Tom Lewis: Thanks, Paul. I’ll go through each segment of the business and start with the portfolio. Obviously the portfolio continue to perform well during the quarter and kind of all across the board operations continued to improve, which we had over the last few quarters. There is no significant tenant issues that arose during the quarter, and we have none on our radar, and at the end of the quarter relative to the larger tenant, about 15 tenants in the portfolio accounted to about 53.8% revenue and that’s down 80 basis points from last quarter primarily as a function of some new acquisitions and new revenue and the average cash flow coverage of store level for the 15 tenants remains fairly high at, a little over 2.3 times, it’s about 2.33 so very healthy. Occupancy at the end of the quarter as you saw on the release was 96.8%, we had 81 properties available for lease out of the 2519 in the portfolio, that’s up 20 basis points from last quarter and about 10 basis points from where we were a year ago and very light activity in portfolio management, but consistent we had 10 new vacancies which was one less from last quarter and we at least sold 13 properties and during the quarter we added to the property portfolio and that’s the reason for the uptick in occupancy. And still a 96.8 up each quarter for the last few quarters as we expected, but pretty good results. Same store rents are starting to accelerate a bit, they were up 1.1% during the quarter, they were up 1% in the fourth quarter and 0.3% in the third quarter and we think we’ll see those continue to increase as the year goes on and move it a modest pace, but positive. And if you look basically where the same store rent came from, we have four of our industries that have declining same-store rent, each of which were pretty modest and that was in restaurant side of service, general merchandise and drug stores and the core declines were only about $333,000 in rent for the quarter. Three of the industries have flat same-store rents and then there were 22 that saw same-store rent increases, about half of that came from our tenants and the theater business, but we also had decent increases from the RB dealerships we have in the portfolio, which obviously is very nice to see coming off in the last couple of years, as their business has improved. And then in child day care and sea stores, the balance was pretty small. But altogether, the 22 industries had about $1.2 million in increases. And so if you net that out you get to about $850,000 in same-store rent. We continue to sees gains in the same-store rents this year and that’s been going on now for several quarters. And it’s just kind of looking into this quarter. Once again, we think we’ll see something similar when we report next quarter. We continue to be well diversified. If you look at the 2,519 properties we added, we’re up 23 in the count from last quarter that’s in 31 different industries with a 125 multiple unit tenants in the 49 states. And our industry exposures remained well diversified. Convenient stores now have jumped to our largest in the portfolio at about 19.9% of rent, we obviously like that industry. Restaurants is now second and continues to come down that was at 18.9% and that’s down about 300 basis points from a year ago and we think that we will continue to decline modestly. After that it jumps all the way down to theaters at 8.1% and it’s fairly well diversified. As you see in the report, the largest tenant is the Diageo at about 5.7%. Second is AMC at 5.3, and again the 15 largest are about 53.8% a rent, when you get through the 15th largest tenant you are down to about 2.2% a rent and while not in the release when you get to tenant number 28, everybody else on the portfolio is below 1% of the rent and as we add more acquisitions here we think those percentages will continue to decline and we will have a more diversification pretty much regardless of how you look at it. From a geographic standpoint, the one state that’s over 10% is California. However over half of that is Diageo, and if you look at the business that we have there that is well centered out of California most of the revenue is booked on a national basis and only about half of the exposure really comes from California and then it drops to Texas at 8.9 and Florida at 7.5, those are obviously both very large states. Average remaining lease term in the portfolio is at a 11.5 years that’s up a little bit from last quarter and a function of acquisition, and we think that will continue to increase as we buy more things this year. Overall, then I think the portfolio is very healthy and just modest improvements continues here coming out of kind of a drop last summer. Moving on to acquisitions, during the first quarter we were very active, we bought 26 properties for a $150 million. Lease yields or cap rates right at about 7.9%, lease term 16, little over 16.5 years and the 26 properties that we brought were leased to six different tenants in five different industries and as we mentioned in the release, about a 130 of the $150 million was part of the transaction that we announced earlier in the quarter that will close over a couple of three quarters. And if we look at this now after completing the balance of the $544 million over the next couple of quarters, that will get us to about $565 million for the year that will close right now, which is pretty good number at this point in the year. We would anticipate cap rates at about 8% or so and if you look at our progress in closing. We closed another $100 million or so here in April, and most of that again was part of that $544 million and the rest of at least spread out of the next three, four months. Obviously given that start, we think it will be a very good year for acquisitions. We’re still using in our guidance 6 to $700 million in acquisitions for the year. We think that’s pretty conservative and we’ll update that as we do more underwriting and see what will end up. We think we’re going to close on the portfolio. And as it is typical in almost any time for us, we’ll close about 20, $30 million a quarter and that’s in smaller transactions just by being out in the business and then the overall acquisition volume for the year is going to be a function of how many larger transactions that we do like last year where I think we close three larger transactions during the year, that got us to about $700 million. We’ve obviously started the year very well with one of them this year and while we continue to see some larger transactions. We’ll have to see, if there are any of them that the balance for the year come in for us. If they do obviously, it could be another very big year in acquisition and if they don’t given the start we have, we think we’re still in a pretty good shape. How relative to cap rates and spreads, it is very competitive out there in the business for a lot of people with capital. I think, we’ll continue to get our fair share of that, given our access to capital and ability to close. But I think we wouldn’t want to describe it, it’s not being a comparative environment but that’s been the case in most years. Cap rates, I think if you’re looking in the investment grade area, I think 7% plus up in the mid to high seven and managing move down or move up the – down the credit curve then you’re probably looking at things up in the 8% caps and on up to 9% and for us this year, we think we’ll blend out again somewhere around 8%. I think while that’s consistent with last year but down a little bit from previous year’s given capital cost spreads remain very high. So it continues to be a very accretive time to go out and acquire new assets in access to capital markets. I think again, this quarter and that – it should be in the next few quarters and certainly it was last year. The main thing relative to our cap rates over the last year has been moving up to credit curve with acquisitions about a $130 million up to $150 million. We did this quarter was with investment grade type tenants. That’s probably lots off 50 to 100 basis points of our yields from what is the traditional tenant base, but given weaken likely blend to about 8% caps this year. I think if you look at the historical spreads even it’s working up the credit curve, the spreads are very attractive. And I have mentioned in the past, if we go back over the last 15, 16, 17 years since we’ve been public and you look at the average spread of cap rate over a nominal cost of equity, which is kind of taking your forward FFO yield and grossing it up for issuance. Generally, cap rates on closing have been about a 105 basis points over that nominal cost of equity and today we’re closer to 150 to 200 basis points while working at the credit curve. And I think it was also attractive about that today. Obviously if you can look at the debt, equivalent debt of the tenant with the same maturity, you’ll find that the spreads we’re achieving here on doing the net leases are significantly higher what you’d see in the equivalent debt and that’s – that’s pretty attractive to add to the balance sheet. Relative to the flow of acquisitions, I would say that the transaction flow that we have to look at is steady and consistent with what we have last year. We’re not seeing a big increase. So I know as we got through early and mid to last year, we’re really accelerated in the volume we looked at. And I’d say that that is flattened out a bit, but still it is a very good pace and we’re very active in underwriting. So it’s a pretty environment if we can find the transaction. And we are cautiously optimistic that we’ll be able to do so on a competitive market this year. Relative to our guidance, obviously getting a strong start to acquisitions and good performance in the portfolio is very helpful to – in revenue FFO and AFFO. And given a continuance in accelerated acquisition activity during the first quarter that we think that will continue, and should be pretty additive to the FFO and AFFO this year. A couple of items relative to the first quarter FFO, Paul mentioned there was about $371,000 in transaction costs – costs on what we closed this quarter and those should go away in the second quarter relative to revenue stream traded by buying those assets and then additionally as most of you know, we also took the opportunity to access the equity markets during the quarter to pre-fund the good part of these purchases. So we have more shares out and cash on hand about a $129 million that prepared for the balance for closing rest of those portfolios, but obviously its put us in a good liquidity position and given us the ability to continue to acquire. And those all went into guidance. And then as I said acquisitions were still using $6 million to $700 million and we’ll kind of balance that and change as we go along. For 2011, we’re still estimating $1.98 to $2.04 at 8% to 11.5% FFO growth and a little higher AFFO 2.03% to 2.07% which will allow us to grow the dividend here in 2011 and at the same time as Paul mentioned bringing the payout ratio down and if we can have acquisitions accelerated that further added out to the numbers. Paul mentioned the balance sheet in access to capital, there is no balance on the line and we obviously have enough cash on hand to close the acquisitions that we’ve done and with no debt coming due. The balance sheet really is in great shape with debt to EBITDA about 4.5 times and we’re quite liquid. The other thing I now want to mention, this quarter we did put into effect a direct stock purchase program also dividend reinvestment program. And for those of you that haven’t had a chance, we also reconfigured and relaunched our website, which we’ve tried to make very consumer oriented for our shareholder base. And so if you get a chance, you might want to take a look at that some time. But to really summarize the quarter, I think good stability in the portfolio very nice and modestly improvement, good start to acquisitions and it’s nice to see those acquisitions coming out of next year now starting to drive the revenue the AFFO and the FFO and that so it’s positive for dividend increases. And with that, I think what we’ll do Joe if you’ll come back? We’ll open it up to questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Go ahead please.
Anthony Paolone – : Hi, thank you and good afternoon everyone.
Paul Meurer: Hi, Tony.
Tom Lewis: Hi, Tony.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Tom, you may have touched on this in your comments and I may have missed it. But as you look at the other types of products that you bring into the portfolio with this large portfolio transaction, how big a part of the company do you think that can became or how do you kind of put parameters around – around that like you’ve done on the industry sector with – with discuss that would be done historically?
Tom Lewis: It’s a great question. We shut down a couple of years ago when we really started working on this. And when we started talking about targets we really wanted to referring from having targets. We have – as you know, we’ve never really said for the year we want to buy $300 million or $500 million or $700 million because than that tends to be what you in that buying regardless of underwriting and we’d rather focused on thing. We’re going to go the – into these areas, look at as much as we can and them limited to those things that really that the underwriting characteristics – that we don’t have a particular target. I think the primary thing rather than property type is to really look at and say you know over the years, one of the best things we’ve done has gone from five industries in the portfolio to 30 and that had all kinds of benefits relative to risk reduction of our cash flows to the reputation and also due to us being able to allocate to a wider variety of industries. And we would like to move that up over the years to 40 or 50 and maybe even 60 industries that we can allocate capital to. But the pace at which it comes in any particular property type, we really don’t have a target. We do continue to not want any industry to move over 20 and we’re closer when they’re down around or below 10%. But at the main part for right now as you look through getting this year and next year, we’re still going to have the vast majority of our assets that are going to be in retail and we’ll add to these as they come along. This was obviously – you look at last year and we had to be ideal purchase which is about $300 million and this is $544 million of which I think 67% of this was outside of the retail of 33% in and that goes together or obviously some large numbers. But adds in the couple three bigger transactions, I think it will be more incremental as we add them and we don’t have particular targets.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Okay. And how this – how much does looking at single tenant office, single tenant industrial add to your deal pipeline like do you – like opening up to that stuff because it’s just massively increase the deal flow or what you guys potentially look at?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, it’s interesting. It does map but we opened up the – the feel to look at, but at the same time I think it really tightens the funnel through which things get through. Because as we look at it underwriting this type of asset. You know you have to sit down and say okay as we’re trying to underwrite things, what are we looking at. And as you know, traditionally our underwriting has been a function of five or six things that we’re looking for and those are usually you know we want to tenant with multiple cash flows, so in retail that’s a chain. If you look over to doing distribution or office or manufacturing, we still want a very large company with multiple cash flows. So if this is their only distribution facility or one of a couple or this is only manufacturing, have only one line of business. I think that’s going to knock. They’re now relative to being something we look at even though the property type fits. And then the second thing is I think for us referred to be worked well for us to do significant due diligence on a tenant, if they’re going to have to – real estate’s going to have to be an important to them and they’re going to need to have a fair amount of real estate, so that the work we do could be amortized over a number of properties. And then I think if they also need to be pretty critical to the manufacturing of their EBITDA. And as you know, we’ve always said that the most important underwriting metric we have is looking at the properties we’re buying, calculating the EBITDA and getting out idea of the cash flow coverage. And in some of these types of properties you don’t have that and when you don’t have it in order to still have a margin of safety. We’re going to have work out the credit curve as we do it. So I think the majority of this that we would do would be less than or it would be investment grade. And so that will tend to knock out a huge part of the pipeline that’s coming through the door now and then second tenant with multiple cash flows. So we’re seeing much, much more just generically coming to door, but a lot of it gets cut out pretty quickly, but I think it will add to our acquisitions in the next few years. Right imagine that somewhere between 10% to 20% to 30% to 40%, 50% of what we do maybe in these areas and if you add that to the overall portfolio it’s fairly modest in terms of how quickly these will build.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Lindsay Schroll of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Go ahead please.
Lindsay Schroll – : Good afternoon.
Tom Lewis: Hi, Lindsay.
Lindsay Schroll – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: I know you guys said that the flow that you’re seeing is similar to last year, but how does that breakout in terms of larger portfolios versus one-off acquisition? Are you seeing more in one area or another or just the same as last year across the broad?
Tom Lewis: I throw that to John Case, our Chief Investment Officer. I think flows about the thing, what do you think?
John Case: Yeah, I think that the flows but same. It really doesn’t vary. It’s not varying much than what we saw last year. These larger portfolios are somewhat unpredictable. We’ve seen couple of them but we’ve seen a lot of smaller opportunities as well consistent with what we’ve saw in 2010.
Tom Lewis: You know I would guess looking over the last 10 years that we see anywhere from 4 to 6 of things a year and typically about 0 to 2 and then last year just happened to be 3 and we had one at the beginning of the year. So they are out there. They do come to us but I think last year the hit rate was just higher but it looks similar this year. Lindsay Schroll – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Okay and did you on the last transaction you guys announced, did you face any competition for that deal, just sort of curious how it was sourced to came above?
Tom Lewis: Yeah I’ll give you a little background, it came from a company out of cargo called ECM and they had filed an S-11 to go public earlier last year and have been going through all of the various spaces of that and as we got into the fall, obviously the IPO market marine space became much more challenging and so they started looking for other alternatives. And we had been watching it and had an opportunity to sit down and talk to them about what they were trying to accomplish, and there were a number of other parties that we’re taking to them and looking at the transaction and we were able to sit down with them and have a just a very good discussion, we also like the people and hit it up very well with them and the portfolio was a little over $700 million and it was very office centric and then there was also a substantial amount of retail that they had, but it was not part of their S-11. And so when we sat down with the first question is globally what are you trying to accomplish for your constituents? And as we were able to talk about that with them, we then were able to say office net lease probably has the less interest for us and we were able to substantially lessen that as part of the portfolio. And then retail is very interested us, so we could add that back in and get to a number in this case $544 million that met their needs. So I think a lot of the people that we’re talking to them kind of move to the side as we were able to get a larger more holistic type of situation together. And then I think after that there were probably a couple of other parties that were still interested, but I think our ability to close and track record of doing so without retrading and doing other things it was helpful. But it’s a nice relationship that was formed with the people.
Lindsay Schroll – Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please.
Jeffrey Donnelly – : Good afternoon guys.
Tom Lewis: Hey, Jeff.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: I’d like Tom’s picture on the website by the way.
Tom Lewis: Okay. What I meant is please look at the website sometime later.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: As I can summarize Tom, I think you’ve been saying that compared to the last 30 years, you think the next ten, the fundamentals of our consumer driven business will be relatively softer and that’s leading you to – to look outside, other types of property. Well, you’ve got a fairly unique cost of capital right now. So I guess I’m curious what prevents you from taking bolder action I mean in ECM certainly was one step up. But should we expect more transactions like that rather than just sort of one of these two reasons in whatever the venue their office I mean?
Tom Lewis: We’d certainly like to do that when you start looking at very large portfolio. If I think they become challenged for a enough of that portfolio to be something that makes it through underwriting where there is a huge population of them out there although we’d love to see that happen. And I’d like to think between this transaction and that the (inaudible) last year, you know $800 something million of which $600 million, $700 million plus was in these new areas was fairly bold for it. But the population group, I think is likely to be in little small – smaller chunks. But we’ll be as bold as we can be as long as it fits the underwriting. And I don’t want to characterize that we’re negative on retail, we just think as you said it will be a little more challenge that has been in the last 20 years. And then the motivation for doing this kind of moves into three or four different things. But we’ll – we’ll move as quickly as we can move, but the underwritings the secrets it as and you look back on the last 20 years and we could have bought a lot more than we did and then we also trying to go back historically what’s – what happens to it and we would have a lot more problems than we would. So it’s a – we’d like to do a big deals, but they’ll come as they come.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: I’m curious in what evidence you have for selling efforts?
Tom Lewis: Well that’s an interesting one. I think it will be more active in selling assets for not – perhaps not here this year, but also in years in the future that’s something that we’d like to run at a little higher rate to more actively manage the portfolio. And if you will allow me Jeff, maybe I can tell two words in one stone and kind of explain for folks, what are the three of four things we’re talking about. That’s kind of let us to do what we’re doing and then secondarily where we’d like to go with the portfolio and that will speak to maybe selling more, is that right?
Jeffrey Donnelly – : Sure.
Tom Lewis: Sure. As we – a couple of three years ago went through a strategic planning process with our board that we haven’t done in quite a while there. The first thing that Jeff alluded to is looking at the consumer retail business and saying look it could be a little tougher. Obviously the consumer levered up in the last 20 years. We had good job growth and retail was just very good and it could a little softer in the next 20 years. And then second as you look at what we did as we really expanded our industries from five to 30 industries where we’re getting relatively penetrated in retail to the extent where if we add anybody new, I think we move off into the big box space which is not an area that we want to do that. And then the third thing relative to retail is if you look at what we buy which is the smaller net lease retail box, it is gone more mainstream over the last five to 10 years and I think it’s a little more competitive and moderated cap rate. And so looking at that looking outside was something that we wanted to do. You know and I really tied to going from five to 30 industries and wanting to expand some more. As we do that being penetrated in the retail, you start looking outside of retail like we did (inaudible). And to get that non-retail exposure to get in to new industries, you’re going to get the non-retail type property. So it’s really more driven in terms of wanting diversified not the assets in the different property type but really more industries that we can go work in to do net lease financing. Now this next part kind of speaks to going up to the credit curve and then also probably selling a little more in the future. One of the things we talked a lot about and going through this strategic planning elevation is looking in the last 30 years, we’ve been pretty well in our declining interest rate environment. And if you look what that did for people in terms of their growth rates, in terms of how they handed their balance sheet and their debt levels and how it changed people’s behavior. It’s pretty stunning that a lot of people will use a lot more debt. And we’ve kind of asked ourselves, if you then look forward over the next 5, 10, 20 years obviously interest rates would brought a lot and they could stay low and will assign a probability to that and say for lack of a better number 25%. But then you start saying what are the chances over the next 5 to 10 years that interest rate twice. And you start like thing something I will let if interest rates go up say 200 basis points for permanent financing in the next 5 to 10 years and you kind of walk through your business and say what would that do when you look at your tenants, you look and kind of refinance their balance sheet for them at 200 basis points higher and then say how comfortable in I would add and you’re probably okay at least we are because we have a high cash flow coverages, and then say let’s give that a 50% probability, which we think is fairly reasonable given it’s 200 basis points off from very low interest rate, and you’d say, okay well that caused us to do. And then I think you’re kind of taking outlier and sign a 25% chance that interest rates go up significantly higher, and maybe people have to refinance their balance sheets at 400 to 500 basis points higher. You look at that and say, what does that do? How comfortable are you with that, and you get about a 25% probability. And when you sit down and do that kind of three or four questions come up. One is that, what do you want to do with your own balance sheet? I think the answer is, while we have that modest task, if we thought that interest rates could go up substantially, we probably want to moderate our leverage. And as Paul mentioned earlier, debt stand about 25% on the balance sheet, and part of that is a function of having done three equity offerings in the recent moths. So that’s one thing we are trying to do. And then, what does it make you do relative to your existing portfolio? And if you do take the kind of base and you do it on prior refinancing rates off those and then you marry it to look at the properties and what their cash flow coverages are, and then go a step further and look at what markets they’re in, and where job growth is, there is some population growth. We are trying to go through a phase of taking the whole portfolio of kind of tenant-by-tenant, industry-by-industry and property-by-property, and laying out on a risk standpoint, where we think the risk sits and then think about over though right away that appear to 3, 4, 5 years, what you’d want to be selling and how you’d want to do it. And we’re kind of in the midst of that right now. And then the last step for that is, obviously what you do with your acquisitions. And I think, going up to credit curve, if you can do it and spreads allow us right now, that is really going to increase the quality of the portfolio, and if you look at possibly higher interest rates at some point down the road or at least the probability of it, that is going to take some risk out of portfolio. So if you kind of look in context of the last year, we started working on this a couple of three years ago. We’ve closed you know 1.2 billion or so or we are about to close in the last 12, 13 months, $700 million of that is been in new industries probably $750 million of that been has been up to credit curve into investment grade and we try to fund it primarily with equity in the last few so, that’s essentially what we are trying to do is to take debt down trying to manage the portfolio for what it would be a little more challenging environment and I think we’re off to a good start. Doing it while you raise FFO because cost of capital is good as really been a nice advantage to do that and be able to raise the dividend and to get payout ratio at the same time and then if you look forward and say okay five to ten years from now down the road interest rates are higher I think will be very well served by it and if interest rates don’t go up then we are in good shape and we’ll have access the leverage is up, that’s kind of what is driving all of this.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: It’s helpful, actually if I could ask one last question, just about the different types of assets you consider you know you mentioned looking at assets that were difficult to separate the earnings generation from the asset itself, what do you think about healthcare assets or large space assets, I know there is another REIT up in the San Diego area that has assets like that, or data centers? I mean all three of those are arguably ones that are difficult to separate, the kind of niche, there is enough of the cap rate difference to make some sense for you guys?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, it’s part of it’s that – kind of when I went through background, that I’ve also alluded to that, what has worked for us over the years is working in the factors that aren’t efficiently financed or mainstream. You know that for us, that was fast food and child care and then auto service, and each of those became mainstream. So we looked a few years ago at healthcare, and there are just a lot of people out financing that and they’re fairly well funded. Data centers there are some people running after that and each of those are specialized, they have some pretty good expertise. So we haven’t seen those as huge areas for our expansion, but we’re also do anything that we can underwrite, understand and has either a cash flow coverage we can look at, and we’re confident in that it pay less the building they lose the EBITDA or work up the curve. So that those three areas we kind of watched with interest, but I think they’re being pretty aggressively financed right now by other people.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Gregory Schweitzer with Citigroup. Go ahead please.
Gregory Schweitzer – Citigroup: Thank you. Hi guys, I’m (inaudible) with him as well.
Tom Lewis: Hey, Greg.
Gregory Schweitzer – Citigroup: Just a follow up on some of the previous questions, and in regards to new industries, have you narrowed down a few or done a due diligence on as you guys talk about, as you continue severance funding up to the 50, 60 industry target?
Tom Lewis: We are kind of in a mad rushed to a lot of at once, but I’d have to say, kind no. As we said last year, we had done due diligence on a number of areas, and got nowhere in line was one, the beverage industry and so that’s one that we really head down a lot of work on. Another one is probably four or five years ago, we assigned one of our people for a year to work in the banking industry and we really aggressively went after and talked every bank in the industry in terms of what they were doing but at the time they really didn’t need capital and when we went back and looked at him again a year ago some of them need capital but we couldn’t figure out what their credit situation is but we’ve done a lot of work there, but seem nothing out of it, there is probably three four more behind that and then we’re really it kind of looks like it did here in 1997, ‘98 ‘99 when we added research we’re really starting to widen the net now and look broadly over a lot of them and at the same time trying to see whether some work to be done, but we don’t have big signing targets, what we done huge amount of research we’re kind of going after now as we do.
Gregory Schweitzer – Citigroup: Okay and then, have you got through the internal reviews that you were taking about earlier, any sense on how much or what portion of the ECN portfolio you might want to sell down the road or are you comfortable with all the tenants in the industry for the long haul at the moment?
Tom Lewis: Yeah we are very comfortable with the tenants, and you know I mentioned before the office for net lease is one for us that’s a little harder to get our hands around relative to release at the end of it. And is open ended question, so that’s where we probably have less interest, we did substantially get the office down to this where it was just three buildings and we’re comfortable with them and with the prices we paid, you know that’s one option to stick back there, but given my conversation earlier about the entire portfolio, I think there is more things there that we’d want to sell than in this particular area, but when you look at the distribution, the tenants, the biggest tenant in here is FedEx with eight of the properties, but it will now be about 2% of our revenue. And the distribution people are investment grade, the office there are close, the manufacturing is MeadWestvaco and Coco-Cola. So those are all areas that we are very conformable with what we have, and I think sales would really come out of the existing portfolios in some areas that tenants and individual properties where we think there might be more risk.
Gregory Schweitzer – Citigroup: Okay. That’s helpful. And I will talk one more the properties and development that required the course was that outside of the portfolio deal?
Tom Lewis: Yes, it was and we are not showing a lot of development and I am look to only have two currently development.
Gregory Schweitzer – Citigroup: Right.
Tom Lewis: And then we have couple of other prosperities that are more less I wouldn’t called redevelopment I called them added investment into fixed development whether expanding on side for really we just had two properties in the entire portfolio, that we are funding new construction from they want.
Gregory Schweitzer – Citigroup: And with that unique opportunity or is that something you are not continue to look at and high – how do you evaluate that?
Tom Lewis: Existing tenant – relationship.
Paul Meurer: Yeah.
Tom Lewis: We’ve got a couple of tenants one in particular that we’ve done a lot of their new stores and very consistently there, extraordinarily profitable, and so we have a comfort level with them. And that’s a majority and there is just new stores they are opening, but like I said we normally like to buy existing with cash flow coverages but we have get that bind any that these guys didn’t open that it didn’t end up with high cash flow coverages. So while it’s very small as part of the overall acquisitions, we are comfortable with these people, and then some others just want to turn it will come to us and say, we want to expand this particular site or some excess land. Obviously we are in the mud to invest, so if they are willing to roll the lease back to a full terminal, allow us to do some added investment, we’re happy to do it, but it’s relatively small.
Gregory Schweitzer – Citigroup: Okay, great. Thank you very much and (inaudible).
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik with Morningstar. Go ahead, please.
Todd Lukasik – : Hi, good afternoon, guys.
Tom Lewis: (Inaudible)
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Just following up on the development, can you guys disclose how much more you’re going to be spending, and when they are expected to be completed.
Tom Lewis: I think its 16.2 million, I believe is the number and there is about 7 million more to fund so relative the size of the company it’s not huge and those are all subject to leases that we have written before the development happens and the completion is guaranteed by the tenants so there is no development risk.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Got it, okay.
Paul Meurer: Cost and timing taken care of relative to development risk.
Tom Lewis: Right.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Got you, okay and then just thinking about needs for exploration, the retail versus the non-retail obviously on the retail side the EBITDA coverage rent gives you some good indication as to whether or not the tenant is going to renew or it will be relatively easy to release upon exploration you mentioned that sometimes on the non-retail side you guys are either aren’t getting that data specifically or is harder to identify are there any other sort of metrics that you look at there, as is just moving up the investment credit curves that gives you confidence that’s a the least exploration.
Tom Lewis: It is moving up the credit curve that’s makes us comfort that we’ll get paid from now to the lease as correction.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Right.
Tom Lewis: Having EBITDA, they can walk away from. And as we did this part of our process, and why it’s going to be a very big funnel, for instance if you’re looking at distribution, and you have a site, you want to make sure that first of all that there is a credit standards. Second you want to know, what they are doing with it advertise and other operations. Is it a distribution facility, that is sitting next one plant, what if the plant closes does it serve two or three plant. Second is that, this recent facility, that is fully built out, ideally what you probably want is additional land and a lot of these people like to put additional land. So as time goes on and they need to expand their business, they can do it. That gives you an opportunity to rewrite the lease up to a longer-term again. So we’re looking for that, and then upfront in these, we’re trying to make sure that the prices we’re paying and that the cost we have as you get more into the industrial pipes give us some margin of safety there. So I think it don’t over pay, really understand use they have make sure they’re up to current standards. But have a good feeling that is a particular one of their distribution in manufacturing facilities but they’re likely to use for many years to come because it’s closer to headquarters or the distributions closer to manufacturing facilities. So we’re really working on that and working up the learning curve, but we start with getting a long-term lease in an investment grade credit.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Okay that’s helpful. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead sir.
Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Hi, good afternoon guys. On the ECM transaction is there anything else in their portfolio or was just the whole thing, I mean would you add something else that they have or you kind of done with them?
Tom Lewis: No we, we’re done for now, they are ongoing entity that will continue to invest for the benefit of their investors and we like each other and so we like to have an ongoing relationship if there is some things to do in the future relative to what they have now we obviously we’re able to take some things that didn’t fit us well or we didn’t know as well and move those out, and those things did fit us we are willing to do all that they have or fit their needs for sales, so I don’t see a lot to do with them right now, but there may be overtime and stuffs we do in there good people we wouldn’t mind that.
Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay Tom, thank you and then do you still kind of close everything in ECM that you are going do by August – by end of August I think you said before?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, that’s our best guess right now. I think by end of August, we should be able to do it, but as you know there is some debt to assume which we typically want to pay off as fast we can, because we don’t want mortgage debt, but when you get into the assumption some mortgage services things can slide a bit, and at this point that and maybe a couple of a closing issues could hold us up but that’s the plant for now
Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay and speaking of the debt, I think you had said you want to eliminate like 223 out of 291 million?
Tom Lewis: Yeah.
Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Is that done, have you done that, are you still working on that?
Tom Lewis: We are working and that process and that will continue through closing and after closing. There may be a more another $20 million, we have to take honor. So it’s just as function of – it turns out it was uneconomic to pay it off, but that will fly and again that’s the mortgage services and people we work with, so happy, happy to get it all paid off, but don’t want to do when it becomes economic, that splits a little bit but not that much and we’re working on it.
Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, I got you. And then I think you sold three vacancies in the quarter, does that sounds right?
Tom Lewis: We sold three properties in the quarter most likely we found somebody who wanted to occupied and – occupied and we prepared to sell them rather than lease them.
Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, I got you. And then will that continue do you think I mean is there a – is there a – I don’t know and the interest from tenants to buy the properties and then the owner occupied kind of thing that would take so more of that that 81 – those 81 assets that you have that are vacant?
Tom Lewis: You know to the extent that you know anytime we get out of 81, we seem to add some and that’s kind of the normal rate that fits there given rough to 2005, 19 properties, but typically what happens is we’ll go out to lease those. And when we find a tenant it either is one that’s fits our portfolio on which case we’d rather keep it on the books or it’s one that doesn’t fits the portfolio and at that point, we’d like to help them to own it. And that has been running anywhere. I just have to look at that this morning anywhere from $15 million to $35 million a year for the last 10 to 11, 12 years in sales. But what I think maybe not this year but moving into next year and the year after I think sales will accelerate but that’s more a function of just work in the portfolio not vacancy and relief.
Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, I got you. Good thanks. And then lastly I had is – was there some particular emphasis to do the dividend reinvestment plan now. I would have thought – I didn’t – you think about it you guys would have had one of those before and I guess you didn’t right now and why I guess now did you suddenly decide that’s a good idea?
Tom Lewis: Yeah one suddenly you know out of this strategic plan process that were a number of initiatives and one of them is one that really build our brand. The monthly dividend company which worked very well for us in the recent years and the financial community and continue to do that really with that income oriented investor. And so it was all tied together with the relaunch of the website which is the first step of a program there over the next few years and adding in the direct stock and the dividend reinvestment at the same time of that. So we really held off on it knowing for a couple of three years that was coming and so we could relaunch the website and really, really start the initiative, they were tied together.
Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, very good. Thank you, guys.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel Nicolaus. Go ahead please.
Joshua Barber – : Hi, good afternoon. Most of my questions have been answered. I just had a quick one as long as we’re on acquisitions. Is there any interest in perhaps some public deals not so much non-IPOs but perhaps other lease that’s out there or was that going that you’re not really thinking about right now?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, that is one we’re always open to but it is long-term been a challenge for us, there was a period there you know from probably 1997 to 2008 where we were offered 7 or 8 and we got very close with the couple and we did a tremendous amount of research and in each case while it came down to is you know you work so hard quarter-by-quarter to meet your underwriting characteristics to your business and then to take a large portfolio underwritten from somebody else all at once that is diversified where you’d have to do all that work and its already been done and they’ve done it differently has made a really problematic to do so and in order to do it you then are looking for some discounts that we would try and reduce or mitigate that risk of taking on other peoples underwriting so you know in each case we couldn’t quite get there and I’ve become a little suspicious to that’s something that will happen on the long-term, but I think is appropriate to remain open to the possibility.
Joshua Barber – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay great thanks very much.
Tom Lewis: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Co. Go ahead.
Omotayo Okusanya – : Hi guys good afternoon congratulations on a good quarter.
Tom Lewis: Thanks Omotayo.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co: Quick questions, in regards to the guidance outlook on the acquisition side.
Tom Lewis: Yes.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co: How should we be thinking how you plant to fund that permanently, should we be thinking about what you’ve done in the past as you, you know once you announce the deal you kind of putting that equity a little bit after that or are kind of thinking about funding that’s a little bit different on a going forward basis?
Tom Lewis: Yeah we pre-funded a lot of this with the equity raises, and if you look at the depth that we’ll assume on this, albeit we’re trying to pay if off I think right now cash on hand gives us a long way towards funding the vast majority of this purchase.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co: Right.
Tom Lewis: We still have the line sitting there if we did small acquisitions on a regular basis it think it build the line up to a $100 million, $150 million before you do something. If you get a large acquisition then I think you try and fund it right away, so you don’t create a lot of overhang.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co: Okay.
Tom Lewis: And given what I said earlier, I think equity – these prices would our choice, preferred also attractive. But if you get into a very large transaction, this is interesting because we did it Diageo last year $300 million and we were wondering about what overhand issues would be to equity, so we started with debt. So all cards are available equity goes choice number one, preferred two, but debt if we think we need to that if we’re going to have to do multiple financing.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co: Got it, okay. And then just kind of – what comfort zone you think should be heading in the market, any interest in doing more dispositions and recycling the (inaudible) in the portfolio?
Tom Lewis: Yeah as I mentioned a little earlier, we’re really in the midst of a project here to take the whole portfolio and look at it from a tenant and industry basis and then separately by a property basis. And really you know we’ve taken it, we put together spread sheets and then put in each market that they are in and rate at the market for job growth and population type of job growth and all of that. We’re in a middle of a process to do that, at the end of it what we want to kind of do is have internally our entire portfolio of scale, most risk to less risk and at that point Omotayo I think we will want to do more active portfolio management and selling a few more but I think it’s going to take through this year to get a lot of that done. We also won all the acquisitions we’ve done so far this year, you know to have the spread hit the bottom line so we an lower the payout ratio while increasing the dividend. One of the interesting things about actively managing the portfolio is that we have paid $300 million of acquisitions with an eight cap that the cost of capital is six and we’re clearing $2 million and we have $300 million of that that’s $6 million and its 4.5, $0.05 of new FFO on spread.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co: Yeah.
Tom Lewis: And to the extent that we take a $100 million out of the existing portfolio, yielding us eight and sell it, we take about 1.5, $0.06 for each $100 million with a 200 basis points spread, out of our growth for acquisition and that assumes that at the cap rate now what you are selling equals the cap rate now what you are buying, if you are selling those things you think it might have some more risk down the line. I think you want to assume that the cap rate is a little higher and so it does eat into your FFO, so I think each year it’s going to be taking a look at FFO growth getting to a good rate of FFO that allows you what you want to do relative to raise your dividend and then thinking if there is some of that you might burn off by taking some risk out of your portfolio and I think it’s going to be year-by-year and its likely next year is the start year we start doing that in the portfolio, but it is something I have an interest in.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co: Got it thanks a lot.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Dizio with Janney Capital Markets. Go ahead please.
Andrew Dizio – : Hi good afternoon guys.
Tom Lewis: Hi.
Andrew Dizio – Janney Capital Markets: Hi just a kind of follow-up to Richards question, about the reception to the direct program, the direct stock purchase options, if you kind of have an early lead on how much capital that will provide each quarter, do you think it’s the kind of thing that can fund this small one off transactions you see every quarter?
Tom Lewis: You know I think it’s very small I really do. It is something that three years we didn’t add because we thought it was really small and most people who did it had the company pay for which means the existing shareholders. We’ve set it up, so the people who use it pay for it and we just want it as an option kind of the overall program of the website and what we’re doing is to kind of be able to work directly with our consumer there but we assume most of their purchases are going to come through their brokers be that and having a full service financial advisor or whether they do that in some other fashion. And what – it’s really not through us majority of the purchase will come but we did one-off for it is an option and we thought a good time to do as when we put the website up. But I don’t think it will be big and we’ll report it as we go along but we’re only a couple of weeks into the website and I think you know 10 or 11 days relative to direct stock purchase and I know somebody has done it but don’t have a read on volume, don’t think it’s big.
Andrew Dizio – Janney Capital Markets: All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Realty Incomes’ question-and-answer session. I’ll turn it back to management at this time.
Tom Lewis: Okay. Well thank you everybody for taking the time, and I look forward to seeing you all soon at (inaudible) in ICFE and thanks again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for using ACT Teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.

===== 2010 Q4  (2011-02-10 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Tom Lewis – CEO Paul Meurer – EVP & CFO Gary Malino – President & COO
Analysts: Lindsay Schroll – Bank of America Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo Gregory Schweitzer [ph] – Citigroup Dustin Pizzo – UBS Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co. Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets Todd Lukasik – Morningstar
Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Realty Income fourth quarter 2010 earnings conference call. During today’s presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation the conference will be open for questions. (Operator instructions) This conference is being recorded today Thursday, February 10, 2011. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead.
Tom Lewis: Thank you, Douglas, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call where we will review our operations for the year and for the fourth-quarter of 2010. I have in the room with me today Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and CFO; John Case, our Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer and Tere Miller our Vice President, Corporate Communications. As always, I must say during this we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail on the company’s Form 10-K, the factors that may cause such differences. As we usually do, Paul will start with an overview of the numbers.
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Tom. As usual, let me give a few highlights of our financial statements and results for the quarter and for the year, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 13.4% to $92.2 million this quarter versus $81.3 million during the fourth-quarter of last year. This increase in revenue reflected a significant amount of new acquisitions over the past year, as well as some positive same-store rent increases for the quarterly period of 1%. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $2.35 million in the comparative quarterly period, naturally, as depreciation expense increases our property portfolio continues to grow. Interest expense increased by approximately $3.75 million. This increase was due to the $250 million of senior notes due 2021, which we issued in June of last year. On a related note, our coverage ratios remained strong with interest coverage at 3.3 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.7 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the fourth-quarter were $5,785,000, up from last year on a comparative quarterly basis, but down about $400,000 from the third-quarter of this year. As we have mentioned over the past year, the increase in G&A this year is due largely to recent hiring and our acquisition in research department. We had reduced G&A in each of 2008 and 2009. During 2010, our G&A expense increased as our acquisition activity increased, and then we invested some more in new personnel for future growth. Our current projection for G&A for next year 2011 is approximately $28.5 million, which will still represent only about 7% to 7.5% of total revenue. Property expenses were $1,925,000 for the quarter. These expenses are primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance and insurance expenses, which we’re responsible for on properties available for lease. Property expenses increased about 10% this year, but our current estimate for 2011 is much lower at approximately $6.6 million or back to prior level. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company and they were just over $500,000 during the quarter. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled just under $4.9 million. Real estate acquired for resale refers to the operations of Crest Net Lease, our subsidiary that acquires and resells properties. Crest did not acquire or sell any properties in the quarter and overall contributed income from discontinued operations of $229,000. As we mentioned in the press release, we did move the three remaining Crest properties held for sale to held for investment as we’ve had strong leasing interest on these three properties, which we plan to pursue rather than selling these properties in the near-term. As part of this move, we did record total impairment of $807,000 in aggregate on these properties. Real estate held-for-investment refers to property sales by realty income from our existing core portfolio. We sold nine properties during the quarter resulting overall in income of approximately $4.6 million. These property sales gains are not included in our AFFO or in our FFO. Preferred stock cash dividends remained at $6.1 million for the quarter and net income available to common stockholders increased to approximately $31.8 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO increased 8.5% to $52.5 million for the quarter. FFO per share was $0.47 for the quarter and $1.83 for the year. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO are the actual cash that we have available for distribution as dividend was higher at $0.48 per share for the quarter and $1.86 for the year. Our AFFO is usually higher than our FFO, because our capital expenditures are fairly low and we have minimal straight line rent currently in our portfolio. We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter. We have increased the dividend for 53 consecutive quarters and 50 times overall since we went public over 16 years ago. Our dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 91% of our FFO and about 90% of our actual cash or AFFO. Turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain a conservative and safe capital structure. During 2010, we were able to permanently finance over $700 million of new acquisitions with $450 million of new common equity and $250 million of 10.5 year bonds at a 5.75% coupon. Our current debt-to-total market capitalization is only 26% and our preferred stock outstanding represents just 5.5% of our capital structure. We had $18 million of cash on hand at September 31, and we have zero borrowings on our new $425 million credit facility. This facility also has an additional $200 million accordion expansion feature. The initial term of it runs until March 2014 plus two one-year extension options thereafter. We have no debt maturities until 2013. So, in summary, we currently have excellent liquidity, and our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and safe. Let me turn the call back over to Tom, who will give you a little bit more background on these results.
Tom Lewis: Thanks, Paul. What I will do is just run through kind of each facet of the business and then talk how we see 2011 shaping up. Let me start with the portfolio. The portfolio continued to perform very well during the quarter and for the year. I think operations continued to prove pretty much across portfolio and I believe that’s mostly true for not only us and the properties, but most of the tenants that are in the portfolio. We did not have any significant tenant issues that rose during the quarter and we have nothing on our radar currently relative to tenant issues. It seems to be a fairly stable portfolio that’s increasing modestly, as we move along. At the end of the quarters, our largest 15 tenants accounted for a little over 54% of our revenue, that’s down about 40 basis points from what it was in the previous quarter. The average cash flow coverage for those tenants is about 2.4 times, so very healthy overall, and all of them have positive cash flow coverage. Relative to occupancy, we ended the quarter 96.6% occupancy at 84 properties available for lease out of the 2,496 properties. That’s up 20 basis points from the third-quarter and down about 20 basis points versus the same period a year ago. During the quarter, we had 11 new vacancies that we leased or sold 11 properties. And since we added 163 properties to the portfolio, that’s how you get to 20 basis point increase to 96.6% occupancy. And I think going forward, looking at the first-quarter, I think we’ll see small but probably continued improvement in occupancy and I would say, flat to up another 10 or 20 basis points would be my best guess as of now, but very healthy. Same-store rents on the core portfolio increased 1% during the fourth-quarter, as compared to 0.3% in the third-quarter and 0.1% in the second. So, the run rate continues to increase and I think it will continue to do so over the next quarter or so. To breakdown really where the same-store rent increases came from, we have three of our industries plus kind of the other category that had declining same-store rents, restaurants, entertainment and consumer electronics were most of it, but the declines in the four areas were only about $170,000 of rent. Three of the industries rent had flat same-store rents and then 23 saw some type of same-store rent increases. About half of that came from theaters during the quarter and then some decent increases on our childcare, convenient stores, and auto service portfolio. The balance of it is pretty small. The 23 industries together, we had increases of about $938,000 and that gave us the net gain of $768,000 which is 1% increase in same-store rent. We’ve been talking for a couple of quarters of seeing the portfolio improvement, but and summer might be the bottom, absent a double dip in the economy, we continue to think that and continue to think we’ll see modest increases as we move into 2011 in the operation of the portfolio. Relative to diversification, as I mentioned a second ago, we’re at 2,496 properties. That’s up 154 properties from last quarter. 32 retail industries, 122 multiple unit tenants and still in the same 49 states. Relative to industry exposure, there’s been a little movement during the quarter. Restaurants continue to come down, and that’s now under 20%, but looking at the first-quarter, the run rate is probably closer to 18% and it is likely in the first-quarter it will become our second largest industry. Convenience stores are at about 17%, but given the recent SuperAmerica acquisition, that should be up to about 20% run rate in the first-quarter. And after those two fairly large industries, you drop down to theaters, which is about 8.6%. So, we’re in pretty good shape relative to diversification and we continue to be. Our largest tenant at 5.9%, as you can see in the release, is Diageo. Second is AMC at 5.5%. And as I mentioned earlier, the top 15 are 54.4% of revenue. To give you an idea of how they really declined as a percentage of the revenue, when you get to the 15th largest tenant, you can see it’s about 2.2% of revenue, past our 27th largest tenant, the balance of the 95 other tenants are each less than 1% of rent, so we remain fairly well diversified. From a geographic standpoint, California is our largest state at 10.8, about half of that is Diageo and they really booked their revenue across the country, so it’s a little less I think economic impact of a 10.8% exposure to California and then Texas at 8.8%, Florida at 7.5%. From the acquisitions we made and properties that were released, the average remaining lease length on the portfolio remains very healthy at 11.4 years. I think that’s up a bit from last quarter. So I think overall in the portfolio it remains quite healthy and again no tenant issues have come to our attention and we feel fairly positive about portfolio. Moving on to property acquisitions, obviously, during the fourth-quarter, we were very active and acquired 163 properties for just under $411 million. Cap rates on the purchases were pretty good at 8.1%. Average lease terms of just over 15 years. And from a diversification standpoint, the 163 properties were leased to 16 different tenants and 10 different industries, the largest was, as we noted in the release, was the $248 million of that, that was the SuperAmerica transaction that represented about 135 properties. For the year that got us to 186 properties acquired for $713 million. Average lease yield was 7.9%, average lease term 15.7 and good diversification, 186 properties leased to 20 different tenants in 11 different industries. The $713 million I think is the second largest total amount of acquisitions in any one year for us, largest for the core portfolio and obviously, very pleased with the results as I think these acquisitions really help us in driving our FFO growth here in 2011. We’ve said for a long time for those of you that have followed us that, generally, we’ll acquire $10 million, $15 million, $30 million each quarter just by being out there in the business, and then that will get us to $100 million or so in acquisitions, and then after that it’s really a function of how many larger type acquisitions we work on in our investment committee. And then if we end up doing none of them, two or three of them and that’s really going to drive the acquisition numbers. So it can be fairly lumpy year-in and year-out and also certainly, quarter-to-quarter. This year we did have a couple of those that came through, the larger transaction, and that’s the reason for having a substantial year for acquiring properties. I mentioned Columbia [ph] second ago and I think this is a great example. For 2010, we did $27.5 million in acquisitions in the first-quarter, $261 million in the second-quarter, only $12 million in the third-quarter, and then $410 million in the fourth-quarter, and that type of movement is fairly typical when we are relying on doing some larger transactions. Usually in this call, as I do every year, after the completion of the year is to try and give you some idea of transaction flow that we went through, and there is a quite a few numbers in here. And if you miss one or two, hopefully, you can pick them up from the copy of the transcript. If you look at 2010, there was $5 billion to $5.5 billion that kind of came through the door, and not all of that actually ends up really getting underwritten or in committee, but relative to what went into the investment committee we had 70 different transactions committee worked on this year. They represented about 1,500 properties. The offer value of those was just over $3 billion. And the average cap rate offered was about 8.8% with a range of 7.5 cap up to about 10.8 capital, so, 70 transactions, 1,500 properties about $3 billion that went through committee. We ended up buying properties in 11 different transactions of some size of the 186 properties, obviously I talked about earlier in $714 million. Cap rates were 7.9%. So, if you take that $3 billion that went through the Committee and that $714 million we acquired, that’s buying about 23.5% of what we looked at in Investment Committee. To put those numbers in prospective, then keeping those for nine years now since 2002 and if you look back over the nine years and look at the value of properties that went to the Committee or the serious deal flow it averaged about $2.9 billion a year and that’s low of just over $1 billion up to a high of about $5 billion and we did $3 billion this year. So, pretty much average for the last nine years. The average we have bought out of that over the last nine years is about $385 million a year, but that’s varied from $58 million at the low and the high of $770 million versus $714 this year. If you run those percentages, the average over the last nine years is acquiring about 13% of what went through Committee with a low in one year of 4% and high of 26% and about 23.5% this year. Cap rates, the average has been about 9% over the last nine years, low of 7.9, high of 10.4, and at 7.9 it was this year. Again, much more comes in the door then ends up in the Investment Committee and the flow is about half, ends up going to Committee of what we take a quick look at and then buy anywhere from 4% to 25% of that in this year, because of a couple of large transactions of this 23.5%. If you look at some of the transaction flow for 2010, it’s down from a few years ago, but I think averaged for the last nine and I think just a pretty good flow given the recovery in the economy and we’re starting to see things open up relative to seeing transactions. Going back on cap rates for a minute, they’ve obviously come down over the last nine years or so as interest rates have declined, and I think as also net leased real estate has become a little more mainstream from an investors standpoint. It’s interesting to note that the spread of cap rates over the 10-year treasury for us, if you look back over the last really 16 years, it’s averaged about 480 basis points the cap rates were over the 10-year treasury. Looking back on the 10-year, we did some averaging, averaged about 3.11% this year. Our cap rates ended up at 7.91%. So, strangely enough, this year it was about 480 basis points spread over the 10-year on cap rates. I think the main thing relative to our cap rates this year for us was moving up the credit curve for the year with our acquisitions. Unlike in previous years, over half of the acquisitions we made this year were with investment grade rated tenants. That probably took 50 to 60 basis points off our yields for the year, but given we were able to maintain very good spreads over our cost to capital, we’re pretty pleased with that. If you look at the acquisitions market now, as we see it, we continue to see a very good flow of acquisition opportunities to work on. Transaction flow to look out, it’s certainly above where it was a year ago and pretty steady just coming through the door. I’d really say that the volume of opportunities accelerated in the second half of the year and looking here in the first-quarter, it’s really staying at about that rate. So, there’s a fair amount that we’re underwriting. We’re fairly active in committee and it will be interesting to see what actually gets through and what we end up closing on, but we have a lot to look at. From an industry standpoint, in terms of transaction flow as always, we’re seeing lot of transactions in the restaurant industry and the convenience store industry. But after those two big ones, what the theme seems to be is that there are number of sellers out there that are looking at cap rates and interest rates and looking into the future and feeling this might be a good time to go to market, so I think that’s why things have been accelerating. And then as you’ve probably noted there has been some pickup in the M&A environment and that generally can bring some transactions out of the woodwork that we can look at. Cap rates continue to decline, I’d say modestly, still given the demand for yield in the world and the number of people out there with money that are looking to buy. I think we generally look for cap rates to be around 8% right now for good transaction. I think that’s pretty much like last quarter, depending on the credit of the tenant. Last year we’re at 7.91% average cap rates and as I mentioned a minute ago that was influenced by doing a lot more moving up the credit curve with investment-grade tenants. So if we’re thinking around 8% or so today, it’s really not cap rates we think moving up, but it’s just a function of not being sure how much will be working up to credit curve this year, so I’d say modesty lower cap rates out in the marketplace, but we should probably hang somewhere around 8% or so. Relative to spreads for us, if you look at the historical spreads over our nominal cost of equity, which is basically taking a forward FFO yield and grossing it up for issuance purposes, I went back and looked over the last 16 years or so, and generally, the average cap rate we’ve gotten on acquisitions have been about a 105 basis points over that gross stuff FFO yield number. Right now it’s closer to 175 to 200 basis points. So, obviously a pretty good environment to take advantage of it, we can find the transactions we like. We’re optimistic about having a decent year in acquisitions, but again it’d just be, what happens relative to some of the larger transactions we get to look at. For our guidance this year, obviously, with the growth in the acquisitions last year that has started to grow the top line which you can see in the numbers and given the fourth-quarter activity, I think that will continue and be very additive this year. You see the guidance is $1.96 to $2.01 that’s 7% to 10% FFO growth. In that number, we’re assuming only about $250 million in acquisitions for the year at 8%, and also assuming that the portfolio continues to be very stable and grow just a bit, and then that should allow us to continue to grow the dividend this year, and at the same time, drop our payout ratio a fair amount. And then if the acquisition numbers will get bigger than $250 million that will give us some more flexibility relative to additional dividend increases or lowering the payout ratio. So, we’ll see how that unfolds. As Paul mentioned, the balance sheet is in good shape. Access to capital is great right now. There is no balance on our $425 million line, and we have some cash on hand, and with no debt coming due and no mortgages, I think in pretty good shape from a capital and balance sheet standpoint to acquire this year. I’ll just conclude by saying, good stability in the portfolio with modest improvement and great year for acquisitions, which will help us for FFO this year and we’ll see what we can get done relative to the acquisition environment right now. With that, I’ll open it up for questions, as Douglas, will come back and say, hi to us.
Operator: (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Lindsay Schroll with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Lindsay Schroll – Bank of America: Hi, guys. Can you discuss some of the reasons for increasing the capacity in the line of credit?
Tom Lewis: First, we wanted to redo the line of credit early just because we thought it was a good time, we wanted the capacity. But as we got into the second half of the year and started seeing the volume of opportunities increase and some of them being a little larger, we thought it’s prudent given the size of the Diageo earlier in year and then we were already working on the SuperAmerica and knew that if something else came around, it would be very helpful to add more capacity. So, the $425 million was a decent guess of what that size should be and then the $200 million of quoting on it I think gives us good flexibility to be working on a couple of things if we needed to do it and be able to close them and not be forced into the marketplace or to go after the term loan very quickly.
Lindsay Schroll – Bank of America: Okay, great. And what are you seeing in terms of large portfolios in the marketplace?
Tom Lewis: As I mentioned, there is more and more, I think as you see more and more M&A activity, that’s really what it’s going to key off up and there were probably three, four or five in the second half of the year really moving later into the year that we were looking at, of which we were able to do some, and that volume is similar today. And they range in size anywhere from $50 million to $300 million, $400 million. And typically if you get 10 of those through the door, we’ll end up closing on a couple of them, but it’s hard to see how much. But it’s fairly active and M&A driven and just as I said earlier a few people who had some good size portfolios they have accumulated over the years, whether a developer or an institutional holder and if they hadn’t gone to market in the last few years because of the state of the economy and not a lot of people investing I think they are seeing it open up and thinking maybe it’s a good time to go.
Lindsay Schroll – Bank of America: Okay. And last question. You mentioned I think that net triple net lease investments are becoming more mainstream from investor standpoint. So, do you think the level of competition is increasing or remaining the same? How do you see that playing out in 2011?
Tom Lewis: Yes, it’s very competitive out there. I wouldn’t want to say it any other way, there’s a lot of capital floating around trying to find a home. I think as long as I’ve been in this business, there’s always been ourselves or maybe one other people out actively buying. And then there is usually, every few years, a marginal buyer that needs to put capital out and they’re out there being very aggressive. I can’t think of a time when that wasn’t the case, and it’s a case today. And then I think you’re seeing more of some institutional players that might not have been doing triple net that are today. So, there’s a lot of capital out looking at it. Each of these companies have different characteristics. So, I think it will be very competitive this year, but I think we’ll be able to hold our own given our cost to capital.
Lindsay Schroll – Bank of America: All right. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: Good afternoon, guys.
Tom Lewis: Hi, Jeff.
Gary Milano: Hi, Jeff.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: Tom, how do you think net lease, I guess initially yields will respond to the prospect of rising interest rates over the next few years. Do you think they will resist some degree of increases or you think it’s going to be sort one for one rise?
Tom Lewis: That’s a great question. Traditionally, when interest rates moved to some degree one way or the other, there was generally a pretty good lag before the property started moving cap rates, and that’s whether they were going up or down. I think that would be the case. But if you look maybe six months to 12 months beyond interest rates really starting to move, you’ll see cap rates starting to move also. But having them through this now a number of times, if you saw 100-odd basis points increase in interest rates, I think you’ll see cap rates go up 10 or 20 basis points for six months and then start catching up. I think they would eventually.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: How do you think about your own cost of capital in that scenario, because right now you enjoy a fairly widespread versus where private market initial yields are on net lease. Have you look at sort of how Realty Income has made its average cost of capital response to changing interest rate?
Tom Lewis: That’s an equation with multiple inputs and outputs. But it’s interesting if that increase in interest rate is due to higher inflation, in anticipation of inflation, as you know, capital flows adjusted that and real estate is one of the places they go to, so you could see an environment where maybe a debt cost might be rising, but on the equity side for a while at least you might get the benefit of some additional flow. But overall, when I look at it, I think cost to capital will probably go up and would probably go up a little faster than cap rates would and that would be margins would come in or spreads would come in. I mentioned today, our equity cost of capital were about 175 to 200 basis points spread, and I think that gets narrowed because if you look at the last 16 years, it’s only been 105 basis points. So, taking the opportunity now to acquire if you can find the right thing, this is the time to do it, but there is enough spread out there right now that you could see the spread close between our cost of capital and smart cap rates and it still be pretty good time to acquire for a while.
Gary Malino: The other thing, Jeff is on the expense side obviously, we have no variable rate debt, so we would not get hurt from a standpoint of any current cost on the debt rising that might not be the case for others. And then our property expenses are naturally going to not be as affected because we’re triple net. So in terms of the existing portfolio and our existing cost structure, rising inflationary environment does not hurt us. And then as Tom mentioned, if debt rates go up a little bit, we think that (inaudible) product could be more competitive as long as they don’t rise dramatically, we like the debt market to be alive and well for our tenants and for folks out there doing transactions.
Tom Lewis: Jeff, one other thing too is, given spreads got as wide as they did this year, I wouldn’t say it was a campaign, but I would say one of the things we’re looking at is, saying, this is a good chance to move up to credit curve, add some diversity to the portfolio relative to some investment grade tenants, and give them a large spread, still have a good spreads to grow their earnings. If you saw interest, if cost of capital going up, it probably causes to do less of that and return more to our traditional things. So we may be able to maintain the spreads a little bit for a while, but ultimately interest rates go up, cap rates will lag it and I think everybody participates in them.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: That’s helpful. I guess one last question is, after you did the Diageo deal last year, you talked a little bit about being more open to, I would call hard assets where I guess I’ve characterized this and I will (inaudible) may be just not detail-oriented, but where you felt like the EBITDA from those assets was inseparable [ph] from the properties operation itself, like farm land or factories and vineyards and things of a such. Have you guys made any headway on assets like those, if you have to target for what I guess I just maybe call them non-retail assets in your portfolio?
Tom Lewis: We wouldn’t mind, and I really look at this over a period of 10 years, kind of widening out the net of it in the portfolio, so very slowly, we start looking at some other areas. Let me kind of go on for just for a minute. It’s interesting. We have six industries and we went public, we are in 32 today and I’d like 40 or 50 if I could, because the real game is allocating capital where people need it and as time goes on, different industries, different need more or less money. While retail will continue to be huge, I think the consumer maybe a little less positive in future years than they were in the past, given they levered up their balance sheets pretty well. And there was a huge amount of new store growth, and we just see a more moderate environment kind of looking into the future, and given that net leases become a little more mainstream, it probably make sense to widen that out, if you can find investments in other areas that have very similar characteristics to support your underwriting. So, I think really forward is if you look at what we’ve done, traditionally, we’re looking for tenants that have multiple cash flows and retailers with multiple stores. If you look at Diageo, it’s somebody with 65 consumer brands in 105 countries. So, the same word owning is not really relying on that fit. That’s the one cash flow stream they have. If you look in other areas if they are not large owners of real estate as a very critical part of their business, probably doesn’t make sense, but when you get the key for us is that the real estate is absolutely necessary in generating the revenue and EBITDA and then trying to tie that EBITDA to the properties as you mentioned. Long-term lease, same characteristics, BBB, net lease and spread. What we’ve done in retail over the years and I think the way we looked at Diageo too is anytime there is an issue in credit underwriting or you know the property is really important for creating their EBITDA, but it’s hard to support exactly how much EBITDA that property does, then you either move up the credit curve. If you recall years ago when we did the Regal transaction doing a structured transaction or something where you maybe only buying land with a lot of assets on top of it, where you are relying on residual value which is we’ve done for about 10 years now in the entertainment areas. So, that’s how we look at it and I think we’ve slowly moved into new areas in the past, I’d like to widen it, but I don’t think it’s going to be some massive campaign. Now we’ve changed where how we’re investing the capital out there. But if ten years from now I woke up and there was 10% or 20% or 30% of the assets that were really outside of retail, but still had all those characteristics in triple net lease, I think I’d be pretty happy about it. As always, I think it’s going to be at least do a lot of research, crawl for a while, then walk for a while and if it works, then you run a little harder.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: The more likely outside, I guess, but I call it consumer area like more of a corporate. Again, vineyards or maybe farmland or like energy power plants, I don’t know, I’m just thinking a lot here.
Gary Malino: We started thinking about this about four years or five years ago. And the kind of first thing is, if you look at the company, we’ve kind of followed the baby boomers over the years. And so, you sit around and just off the top of your head, you go, okay, how old is this large group of demographics and what’s in the future, adult day care, drug stores, health and fitness, health food, medical equipment, that type of things you start thinking, but then it really happens slower than that. So, while I think it will happen, I don’t think it’s going to be anything way out there. We started looking at lines four years or five years ago, did the research, didn’t think we’ll get there, and then Diageo came up. We also did some additional Diageo in the fourth-quarter, about $30 million worth, but beyond that, I don’t know not else we do in wine. So, we really don’t have wine target. I think it’s just being open to two things that come across our desk that fit the characteristics.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: I’m sure you’d like to do due diligence on the golf course, so…?
Gary Malino: I’d love to do the due diligence but I doubt I’d like to invest.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: Thank you, guys..
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Schweitzer [ph] with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Gregory Schweitzer – Citigroup:
Hi, guys.:
Tom Lewis:
Hi, Greg.:
Gregory Schweitzer – Citigroup: I had a couple of questions on the SuperAmerica deal. Perhaps you could walk us through how you are comfortable and underwrite, any potential environmental concerns that went along with the same-stores and SuperAmerica (inaudible)?
Tom Lewis: As you know we’ve been in that industry for nine or ten years before we did that about 70% of revenue and done a lot of transactions. It really starts for us is the risk in that business changed a fair amount of number of years ago when everybody in America that operates a gas station or convenience store that sold gas had to replace their tanks and put in new double vault tanks with alarms and so I think that game changed a little bit. And then secondarily, a lot of studying over time to see how much environmental liability really comes out of gas stations to convenience stores, which is a lot less than you would think. The next thing then is working with a large enough entity that is going to basically take on that liability for you, which all of the tenants do their first responsible for it rather than us, so, as long as you have a viable tenant, it’s not you. You then go out and do phase ones, you look at the history, and then very often what we do is require the tenant most of the time or all the time to have environmental insurance above and beyond just indemnifying us. We also look very carefully at each state that we invest in and watch their situation. Do they have a fund, who would have access to it, under what circumstances, then we carry our over own environmental liability insurance which we’ve never had to use. So, if you work through all of that and you look at the history of convenience stores, particularly when they are leased to a larger entity there has been, we really haven’t had evidence of environmental liability in this industry. But that’s kind of how you got there. And in this particular case, this obviously was a spin-off the division at Marathon Oil, which included refinery and a pipeline and a very large support services and 160 plus convenience stores. So, a large public company like that particularly in these days of SarbOx has a lot of control. So, if you walk through all of that we get pretty comfortable and I don’t know if I left anything out, Paul?
Gregory Schweitzer – Citigroup: Got it. Thanks. And apart from the locations, do you have any insights on what differentiated these (inaudible) Speedway brands that Marathon ended up keeping?
Tom Lewis: I think it was more of a geographic movement tied to the pipeline and the other operations, and over as you’ve seen in recent years it was kind of the trend from the major royal kind of moving out of retail and focusing on the other end of their operation. But I really don’t think there was a lot. If you look at these convenience stores, they are the poster child for what we look for in the industry. They are first of all, over an acre of land. And as you know, you want both the convenient store and gas station, so you can amortize to cash flows over one rent, and these averaged 1.14 acres. Second thing in that business is you could see a lot of convenience stores of maybe 800 or 1,000 square feet, but, until you get a closer to 2,000 square feet, it’s hard to really merchandise those stores effectively, and the industry about 30-year revenue and two-thirds of your profit book comes from the convenience stores. So, to the extent that you can get larger stores, they can be effectively merchandised and these average 3,500 square feet, which were on the large side of what we bought, and that 6.5 multi pump dispensers and the card readers and everything you would see. The other thing though is, there are not new stores, the average age is about 20 years old which is surprising given the size to that type of size is not typical back then. All of them have basically being reengineered and lot of money put into them over the last seven years to eight years. For us, if you look at Speedway, there are similar large stores and those that are kind of the most valuable I think because of the revenue stream that can be thrown out from a larger store that can be merchandise are what people look for the industry and these had them. I think it was more geographic. This one was unusual for us, and typically when we do a portfolio spread out around a lot of state. And in this one, there was I think 160 convenience stores that came with it, of which we bought 135 and the vast majority in one metropolitan area, which is Minneapolis. So, if you look at this size of store concentrated in a metropolitan area and we were able to get them at about $1.8 million per copy we felt very strongly that they were good stores. I don’t it was choice of these were Speedway for them, but I don’t know you’d have to ask them.
Gregory Schweitzer – Citigroup: Okay. One more in that line. What are the gas gallons sold metrics versus the national average?
Tom Lewis: They are higher but as you know we really can’t report our tenants operating numbers nor their financials. They get to do that but they were substantially higher which is something that we really look at and same with merchandize. I think it is very good purchase for TPG and ACON.
Gregory Schweitzer – Citigroup: Okay, thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dustin Pizzo with UBS. Please go ahead.
Dustin Pizzo – UBS: Hey, thank you. Tom, as you are looking at acquisitions today and then 2011 what you currently have either under contract or under LOI?
Tom Lewis: I respectively reported what we bought at the end of the quarter. The exception we do to that is, if we have something big that we have tied out and we know that’s going to close and we are not in that situation today. So, like last year when you looked at 27 million 260, 12 million 400 its very, very difficult for us to know quarter-to-quarter, but we don’t report what we have under contract and have tied up because how you define that really drives what those numbers are and until you absolutely have it under contract in your (inaudible) and you have completed your due diligence we don’t for close.
Dustin Pizzo – UBS: In the guidance the way that the acquisitions are factored in that are you assuming that they inevitably occur throughout the year?
Tom Lewis: Generally, what we do is assume that the majority will close at the end of the quarter, as a lot of times they do, so, we’ve just divided it up pretty much at the end of the four quarters throughout the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Co.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co.: Just a quick clarification. You mentioned that the rent coverage ratio on the portfolio right now is 2.4 times.
Tom Lewis: Yes.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co.: That number, if I remember correctly, used to be at highest 2.7, correct?
Tom Lewis: Yes. Actually, that’s a very good memory. It was about three, four years ago, 2.77 I believe. That’s the number in ‘06 and then came up and was lower a couple of years ago. I think it was like 2.47 a couple of quarters ago and 2.42 is what it came in this time.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co.: Could you talk a little bit about which particular industries are driving that average a little bit lower?
Tom Lewis: Okay, now you’re really going to challenge me, Omotayo, because while I have that stuff, trying to remember off the top of the head. It’s interesting, during the recession, I will tell you that it was, if you recall, we talked a lot about the RB business and our tenant net industry. What’s interesting, they’re now in the upper half in cash flow coverage and RB sales were up 48%. So I know that one flip-flop big the other way. I think restaurant continues to be challenged. That’s the industry that I think hasn’t gotten a lot of traction. The fast food guys have done pretty well, but outside of that, restaurants, while they have made improvements and they’ve rationalized their business and kept capital costs, while a lot of them had a chance now to fix their balance sheet, their business in no way has come roaring back, so I think those are the ones that if you look across, are probably the weakest. After that, everybody is looking pretty good.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co.: So, just because of restaurants are not such a big part of your overall portfolio, it really skews the mix?
Tom Lewis: Bob about 17% and I was going to get the range, the cash flow coverage are somewhere around 1.5 and then go up in the high threes by tenant, so that’s kind of the range.
Omotayo Okusanya – Jefferies & Co.: And then just given all the long competition you had mentioned increasing the available cash in the market. Are you so much surprised that 1031 transactions have not thought of coming back?
Tom Lewis: That’s a very interesting question and the answer is I don’t know if I’m surprised, but it’s a good observation that the money that’s floating around is in institutional hands and I think it speaks to the bifurcation that everybody is noticing in the economy that it’s very much have, have not society and those institutions that are large and can get access to capital out there and those that are smaller really struggle. So, given that’s the case, it’s kind of the same in our markets, so 1031 is soft but there is a number of institutional players with money.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Moore with RBC Capital Markets.
Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Given all the capital time that you were talking about that is out there and then these other good ideas that you’d like to pursue for other sectors, other concepts. What do you think about selling some of your assets at a bigger pace than what you’ve done historically?
Tom Lewis: It’s interesting as we walk through there, if you get a let’s say an acquisition pipeline that’s very, very, very large then you can do it and it can be somewhat accretive and we haven’t really had the opportunity to do that too much in the past. It’s been modest sales. As we go forward looking in the portfolio, I don’t think it’s anything in the cards for this year, but it is something that we’re really thinking about relative to looking at various industries and lease durations and knew what opportunities are out there. But something that’s hanging in the back of our mind that, nothing that we see coming really for this year, unless all of a sudden we see a huge amount of acquisitions coming in. And then I think you can make some major move in the portfolio without upsetting the revenue stream too much.
Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets: I see, but even to take the opportunity to go up the credit curve a bit even with a little bit of loss of FFO or capital or cash flow it wouldn’t interest you to get rid some of these?
Tom Lewis: It would interest me, but after a very happily getting through the recession was stable FFO, I’d like to grow it a bit, get the payout ratio, down raise the dividends a bit, and that will give us a flexibility to start doing that.
Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets: And then this is the time of year went when retailers seem to have their difficulties if they’re going to have difficulties, how are you guys thinking about any troubled tenant exposure?
Tom Lewis: It’s interesting, you’re absolutely right, they go through the holidays. Of course, most of our portfolio is service-orient, not tradition or retail, the guys that are in the malls and really booking the huge Christmas sales. So, I think we’re less exposed to that, but we have seen January, February, March is the time, but there is really almost nothing going on in the portfolio. I did a scan of the major tenants out there and we have an absolute nothing come on our radar screen right now for this year, which is one of the reasons we’re fairly positive about things.
Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Last thing I had was there is obviously been some demand increase from the big box type retailers and others out there and I’m wondering how you’re coming on the 84 leases, obviously, you did some this quarter and it came back to 84. But what do you think going forward for the ones you have that are vacant that you’re trying to lease out?
Tom Lewis: We’ve actually made some good progress that it doesn’t show in the numbers because we had 11 in and 11 out, but one of things that’s happened is, you are right there is some demand on the larger size and so some other re-leases that we were able to do was on the larger space. As you know we calculate our vacancy by taking the number of vacant, 84 and divide it by the number of properties 2,496 and that gets you to the number. What we also track internally is the ones that are vacant is what percentage of the revenue they represented before they went dark. Generally they match up pretty evenly, but right now it’s 3.4%, just on a numerical from a vacancy standpoint, but it’s only 2.7 on a revenue side. So, we actually did, what we did move was some larger space, which helped us out in that. The numbers were actually little better than they look.
Richard Moore – RBC Capital Markets: So the remaining ones ahead are smaller assets in general?
Tom Lewis: Yes, they are. There is a lot of child care hanging out in there on those numbers that we’re working on.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik with Morningstar.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Just Paul quickly first, I don’t know if you got the lease termination fees for the quarter?
Paul Meurer: Lease termination fees for the quarter, I’ll find it while we speak.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Other question I had followed it on with the interest rate question you guys fielded earlier. I’m just wondering what your expectations are with regard to inflation. If you want to hit on any other key points about how inflation impacts the portfolio performance and whether or not expectations of rising inflation rate would change? How you think about permanent capital between debt preferred and common?
Tom Lewis: Sure. I will let Paul answer that question you signed it and then I’ll come back.
Paul Meurer: $350,000 for the quarter.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: That’s quite a bit lower than run rate prior to that, right?
Paul Meurer: Yes, I mean, let’s see, compared to quarter a year ago, that was about $80,000, but on a year-to-date basis, that’s actually down. We had that just under $500,000 this year for the year whereas we had over $700,000 in ‘09. One, it was stressed for some tenants, there was obviously some negotiations going on where they wanted to exit a lease early and that sort of thing. We’re not having as many of those discussions today.
Tom Lewis: Relative to kind of inflation and the impact on our thinking and capital structure and what we do? It’s interesting. I thought, we were going to have a major recession for about three years before we had one, so I think that there could be some inflation in the offering, but I’ve learned not to try and guess what it is. Just that we are more likely now to have it in the future perhaps than in the past, given monetary policy out there and what you’re seeing in commodities and some other areas. But it does. One of the things we’d like to do is really relates more to the impact than inflation might have on interest rates and higher interest rates, given how low we are and after 30 years of declining interest rates, trying to look forward long-term and assume that we’re more likely than not going to see increasing interest rates, given how low things are and so we have more of a prejudice even than we had in the past for utilizing equity, although I’m sure at some point, we’ll use debt. If you look into last few years, our debt on the balance sheet has started to decline. Debt-to-market cap like 26 something. And we’d like to bring that down further because I think in the next year or two or three, everything’s just fine. But if you start looking even in modestly levered balance sheet like ours and refinancing three, four, five years down the road higher interest rates, you can have some FFO pulled out of the numbers, and to the extent that you continue to have debt on, that could be sizable. So I think it really leads us towards trying to keep a very modest amount of leverage on the books looking over the next five, six, seven years and then kind of being tactical in the short-term. Relative to the revenue side in our leases, one of the things that’s happened over the last 25 years is given there was a big bout of inflation early in our business as retailers really got away from allowing landlords to have a lot of inflation increases in the leases, and while they are talked about a lot, most triple net leases don’t have a lot of them. We’ve built into ours that we don’t straight line as you know anywhere 1% to 2%, 2% plus per cent and when you get much beyond that and you look at inflation, it’s hard to adjust. That’s been a major program we’ve been on for couple years. But given the size of the portfolio and how difficult it is an acquisition it is very hard to move that number. But looking back two and half years ago, only about 6% of our leases really adjusted well for inflation, either through being a flat percentage of sales or CPI, we now have that up to about 18%, but it’s very slow going trying to move that needle. So if you had higher inflation, higher interest rates, I think we would adjust decently on the revenue side. But on the expense side, we want to make sure it doesn’t hurt us, so it probably leads us to lean more towards equity than debt.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: And thinking about common versus preferred, if you think there is going to be an inflationary environment, would you have a preference for preferred equity?
Tom Lewis: We’ve used preferred. If you look at the differential in price today, it’s substantial. If you do a kind of the forward FFO yield, grossed up for issuance on equity, you get a little over 6% today, not much and fall off your issue preferred.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: We could do something inside of seven, but from an all in cost basis you are around 7.
Tom Lewis: So you give up 100 basis points today, but you kind of fix it. It could be attractive. We’d have to watch it, but I don’t think preferred will be a huge part of the capital structure, so I think we think equity first, preferred second and then debt when tactically it makes sense for us. Like Diageo, when it was a fairly large acquisition in the new area and we weren’t sure quite what the impact that marketplace was going to be, and we were able to finance first with debt and turns out the market was seem to be happy with what we bought, came back with equity and that’s kind of like we want to use debt, but we used both.
Operator: This does conclude Realty Income’s question-and-answer session. I’ll like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.
Tom Lewis: Thank you everybody for taking the time today, and we’ll talk to you soon at one of the meetings out there, or hopefully at the next call. Thank you very much. Thank you, Doug.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We like to thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2010 Q3  (2010-10-28 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Tom Lewis – CEO Paul Meurer – EVP, CFO
Analysts: Lindsay Schroll (ph) Greg Hannon (ph) – Citi Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo
Operator:  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. During today's presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode.  Following the presentation the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions). This conference is being recorded today Thursday, October 28th, 2010.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.
Tom Lewis:  Thank you very much, Mitch, good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the conference call, obviously to go over our operations and results for the third quarter 2010.  In the room with me today is Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Gary Malino, our President and COO; Mike Pfeiffer, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and John Case, our Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. And as always, the starring part of the call is that during this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law. The company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. And we will disclose in greater detail on the company’s quarterly and on Form 10-Q, the factors that may cause such differences. And we’ll just start with Paul running through the numbers for the quarter. Paul?
Paul Meurer:  Thanks Tom. As usual, I will briefly comment on our financial statements, provide a few highlights of those financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased to $87.2 this quarter versus $81.5 million during the third quarter of last year. Rental revenue increased over 7% reflecting new acquisitions over the past year, and positive same-store rent increases for the quarterly period. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by about $1.4 million in the comparative quarterly period, naturally depreciation expense increases as our property portfolio continues to grow.Interest expense increased by approximately $3.76 million. This increase was due to the $250 million of senior notes due 2021, which we issued in June. On a related note our coverage ratios remain strong with interest coverage at 3.1 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.5 times.  General and administrative or G&A expenses in the third quarter were $6,165,000 up from last year, but down about $500,000 from the second quarter of this year. As we mentioned on our last two earnings call, the increase in G&A this year is due largely to recent hiring and our acquisitions and research department. Our current projection for G&A for 2010 remains the same at about $26 million or about 7.5% of total revenues. Property expenses were $1,753,000 for the quarter. This is an increase of $291,000 for the comparative quarterly period, but only about $75,000 from last year. These expenses are primarily associated with the taxes maintenance and insurance expenses which we are responsible for on the properties available for lease. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company and they were $335,000 during the quarter. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled just under $2 million.  Real estate acquired for resale refers to the operations of Crest Net Lease. Crest is a subsidiary that acquires and resells properties. Crest did not sell any properties in the quarter but overall contributed income or FFO of $221,000. Real estate held for investment refers to property sales by growth to income from our existing core portfolio. We sold nine properties during the third quarter resulting overall in income of approximately $1.8 million. But again a reminder that these property sales gains are not included in our FFO or in our calculation of our AFFO. Preferred stock cash dividends remained at $6.1 million for the quarter and net income available to common stockholders was approximately $25.6 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO was $47.8 million for the quarter, down slightly from last year, but up over about $1 million from last quarter. FFO per share was $0.46 for the quarter, down $0.01 from last year, but up $0.01 sequentially from last quarter. Adjusted FFO or AFFO or the actual cash that we have available for distribution as dividends was higher at $0.47 per share for the quarter. And our AFFO as we’ve said before is usually higher than our FFO, because our capital expenditures are very low and we have very minimal straight line rent in our portfolio.  We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter. We have increased the dividend 52 consecutive quarters and 59 times overall since we went public, 16 years ago this month. Now let’s turn to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure, our debt-to-total market cap is only 27% and our preferred stock outstanding represents just 6% of our capital structure. We were very pleased to access the equity market last month, raising almost $200 million of common equity to pay for recent acquisition. We thus had a $156 million of cash on hand at September 30th, although we did use a lot of that this month to close the acquisition of 23 properties for a $126.5 million. We had zero borrowings on our $355 million credit facility at the end of the quarter. This facility also has a $100 million accordion expansion feature. The initial term runs until May of next year, plus two one-year extension options thereafter. And our next bond maturity isn't until 2013. So in summary, we currently have excellent liquidity, and our overall balance sheet continues to remain healthy and safe. Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom, who will give you a little bit more background.
Tom Lewis:  Thank you, Paul. And I’ll start with the portfolio, which continued to perform well during the third quarter. I would kind of describe operations as being in a back to normal state versus what we’ve had in the last few years which was nice to see. And there were no significant tenant issues that rose during the quarter and we have none on our radar currently, so it’s nice and quiet in the portfolio. At the end of the quarter, our largest 15 tenants accounted for about 54.8% of our revenue and remained pretty healthy. The average cash flow coverage of rent at the store level for the 15 largest tenants was just under 2.4 times, so it remained very healthy. Occupancy in the third quarter ended at 96.4%, that’s 84 properties available for lease side of the 2,342 we own, that’s up about 20 basis points from the second quarter and down about 40 from a year ago. In the last quarter, we had only 12 new vacancies which is about half of what we have had in the previous quarter and were leased or sold 18 properties during the quarter and that was the reason for the increase in occupancy. Obviously at 96.4%, it’s still very high and up a little bit versus last quarter as we expected. We’d also look for I think small but continued improvement in occupancy in the fourth quarter as we’re going through things right now and we think we’ll be up a little bit at the end of the year. Same-store rents on the core portfolio increased 0.3% during the third quarter compared to 0.1% in the second a small increase to positive. And if you take a look at where the increases and decreases came from, there were three of our industries that are in the portfolio and our other category that had some declining same-store rents and that was primarily restaurants, which were about half of that, and the rest of the numbers were fairly small. And between the four industries, the decline was only about $282,000. We have three of the industries that had flat rents and then 23 that saw some type of same-store rent increases. Nothing really big to any one industry, but if you take four or five, most of it came from auto service, convenient stores, theatre, health and fitness, motor vehicle dealerships and child care. The 23 together had same-store rent increases of about $517,000. So you net that out and that’s a gain of $235,000 which is how you got to the 0.3%. I mentioned last quarter that kind of absent a double dip in the economy, we thought we were at the trough in the portfolio are relative to occupancy and same-store rent. We think that indeed was the case.  And then also in same-store rent, I mentioned that over the last couple of years, we’ve had a couple of tenants we did some workout with and gave some rent reductions. And if you look at those there are only two of those that are still impacting the same-store rent numbers. One of them goes out a comp numbers in the fourth quarter which was majority of it and the other one will come out in the second quarter of next year. So I think we’d anticipate that same-store rents in Q1, Q2 next year should start accelerating quite nicely absent anything else going on. So that’s positive. We continue to be well diversified. The 2,342 properties, 32 industries, a 118 chains, and 49 states. Our industry exposures remain well diversified. Large two tenants as you can see from the list are now Diageo and AMC Theaters. And as I mentioned earlier, the 15 largest tenants are about 54.8% of rent. And when you get down to the number 15, you are only about 2.2% of revenue and after that it remains fairly small.  From geographic diversification, California as I mentioned last quarter would be did become our largest state this quarter and that’s function of the Diageo transaction, but we will also mention since those properties that we’ve bought in Napa generate most of the revenue from sales around the country, I’m not sure it really adds to the concentration level of California. But California is now at 10.9 and behind it Texas 9.2, Florida 7.5, and then down from there, but still fairly well diversified. Average remaining lease term on the portfolio is 11.2 years, not anticipated given the acquisitions we’re working on in the fourth quarter or closing that that might increase just a bit. So the portfolio remains in good shape. Let me move on to acquisitions for a moment. During the third quarter, we bought just two properties for $13.9 million. That brought us for nine months to about $303 million in acquisitions, average going in lease yield or cap rate was about 7.6%. And as you saw in the release we’re quite active here in the fourth quarter. And so far we’ve closed to date 23 properties for $127 million.  And as Paul mentioned, those are leased to 13 different tenant and eight different industries, properties are at six different states. And the various industries that the investments we’re in were small investment in the consumer electronics, drug stores, grocery stores, sporting goods, health and fitness, apparel, office supplies, and crafts and novelties. And there is really not a large concentration of any of those in the portfolios from the [inaudible] standpoint, so it should all be very, very additive, and obviously all the industries that we’re already in. Off the 13 tenants that we’re in it, that’s pretty widely spread out. I think nine are new to the portfolio. So I don’t think we’re meaningfully adding any concentration by tenant either and it’s pretty well diversified. And then I generally characterize the credit on the 13 different tenants is as on average being higher than our portfolio sits today. So a little increase in credit, higher credits which along with the Diageo transaction that we did earlier this year seems to be the theme so far this year. But nice and full acquisitions for the portfolio. And as we always do, we will provide some additional data on these as is our custom when we aggregate all of the fourth quarter acquisitions when we do the fourth quarter call and add in blended cap rates and all the rest on those acquisitions. And that gives us to about $430 million a year for acquisitions.  And then as we mentioned, we have under contract the portfolio of a 136 properties that would be leased to one tenant for approximately $250 million, that’s part of an M&A transaction that we hope to close this year or early in the next year and once again in an industry that we’re already in, however it would be working with a new tenant. In this case, in particular working with the buyer of the company, who is working with a seller of the company, and the timing and closing, and the additional disclosure relative to any data on that portfolio is in their hands at this point. And so we’ll wait for them to conclude the transaction which we anticipate should happen in the next 90 days. And at that point, we’ll try and add some additional color relative to industry tenant and some other details at that time. But we thought it was important to at least get out there relative disclosure given the capital markets activity we just undertook and it gives everybody a little greater context on why we took a little more money than we needed to fund the acquisitions that we’ve already closed in the fourth quarter. Should that one close by yearend that will bring us to around $700 million at acquisitions, just about an 8% cap rate or lease yield for the year, and that’s obviously a stronger year in acquisitions than we originally anticipated. And that along with the portfolio doing pretty well, I think bodes well for revenue and FFO growth next year. Let me just talk a little bit about the acquisition market from what it looks like today. We continue to see what I’d call a decent flow of acquisition opportunities to work on. We would usually report at the end of the year and we will again this year, but we’ll probably see a little over 2.5 billion that we look out seriously for the year and that goes to our committee. That’s usually a 3 to 4 times that much that may come through the door. But you can pretty quickly get to a lot of it you know it’s not going to work. So about 2.5 billion is the committee fee. I will put that in perspective.  Really from about 2005 to 2007 that number was more like 3.5 billion to 5.5 billion. So the run rate today in terms of just general transaction flow is substantially lower than it was in 2005 to 2007. But if I go back and look it closer to kind of 1.5, 2.5 run rate that we saw pretty much from 2000 to 2004 that is most certainly up over a year ago and it will be interesting to watch and see how that continues growing. But for right now we have some things to look out. If you look at what’s coming across [inaudible] relatives to kind of industry’s theme, there isn’t a lot. I think in every call I’ve done over a time, if somebody asks are there particular industries where you see transactions, restaurants and convenient stores is always mentioned, and that’s just because there are a lot of units and a lot of players in those industries, they’re both fragmented, so there always seems to be a fair amount going on there. And that hasn’t really changed. But outside of that really looking to theme, it’s not really industry, but we get comments from people that look at cap rates today and think perhaps this is a decent time to sell and have some liquidity. There is also some ongoing M&A that you are starting to see on the Street which I think has been recognized in the press and other areas. And then we’ve really had some people citing as we get towards the end of the year here, potential changes in tax rates. And because of that they need to follow a property here and there and that’s been beneficial. Cap rates have continued to soften a bit and I think that’s given the demand for yield in the world today and kind of blow interest rates everywhere. And I think we would look for rates to generally be in about the 8% range or decent 5% transactions can be a little lower than that as you move up the credit scale and maybe a little down as you move up or vice-versa little lower as you move up the credit scale or higher as you move it down. But I think low interest rates really are impacting yields on almost any type of investment. I think that’s certainly the case in our market also. At the same time though, our cost to capital has been very attractive. Even though cap rates have softened, I think spreads on new acquisitions right now are just not the best we’ve ever had as long as we’ve been doing this.  I went back and looked in the – I keep a chart that every year is kind of the nominal cost of equity which was talking an FFO yield providing a bite of stock and then grossing it up for the cost of issuance to try and get you a nominal cost, hurdle rate of equity if you will and then comparing it to the cap rate for each year that we bought out.  If you look over the last 15 years, we’ve averaged over a nominal cost of equity spreads of about a 105 basis points on acquisitions. And if you look this year on what we’ll buy, I think the spreads are closer, actually it will [inaudible] about 200 basis points. So even though the cap rate will soften a bit with cost capital where it is it has been a very good environment relative to spread to acquire and it will continue to do so. The other I’ll mention on acquisitions is and I’ve done this for a few quarters, but I get so descriptive of where the market is today, which is out there being in the business, you will see $10 million, $20 million, $30 million that you will do on a quarter, and then it comes down to maybe a couple of large transactions that really moves the ball.  And should they send it year one close and obviously the Diageo earlier is the primary differential, I think we started off the year guiding to about $250 million of acquisition and said that will just depend on if we do a couple of big deals and that looks like it indeed is the case. And I think that will probably be the case going forward. It’s kind of this run rate of $10 million to $30 million a quarter and maybe $40 million and taking a look at if any larger acquisitions come in. Relative to guidance, for 2010, we guided the 182, 183, which would be half the 1% in FFO growth. And that is really a reflection of raising the additional equity before we close the properties. And raising a little extra if equity given***End*** And that is really a reflection of raising additional equity before we closed the properties, and raising a little extra equity given that – we likely will have some additional acquisitions coming, and then the acquisitions closing primarily in the fourth quarter with very little in the third. For 2010, we also have on our assumptions plugged in the $250 million acquisition transaction to close towards the end of the year and not substantially add to the revenue line for this year. It could be a little after that, it could be a little bit before that. And then relative to permanent capital, we plugged in about $200 million equity offering for later in the year to fund that. But I also want to state at this point, we wanted to put something in there that is a plug, but when it closes we’ll decide how we should permanently fund it and what kind of capital to use, obviously equities been attractive but where it is a month or two from now is an open question.  Debt markets are also very attractive for us. I think 10 year-to-date we’ve been inside 6%. So obviously the spreads would be a little larger if we decided to go that route. Preferred is also isn’t bad, I think that being inside 7, and when we get around the closing this spell, we’ll take a look at capital markets and try and way in and look the best form a capital positions would be. Obviously that will impact the numbers. If we use equity this year, that’s in the numbers. If we don’t close at this year and don’t fund it this year, that would add a little bit here to the numbers in 2010.  If we close it early next year then depending on when and how we fund, that obviously can move the numbers a penny or two. So we’ve tried to be conservative on this and try and get some guidance that we can get relative to close to into. Obviously, as you look at this year, acquisitions have started to grow the topline. And you can see that in the numbers and we think that that really helps us relative guess from clarity for our guidance for next year and our ability to see a FFO growth.  In the release you’ll notice that for 2011, we’re estimating $1.96 to $2.01 per share. That’s 7% to 10% FFO growth for the company. We did use within that for acquisition purposes for next year, plugged in $250 million for acquisitions with most of it closing in an equal basis at the end of the quarter. Anybody that is running a spreadsheet that will give you a little insight into that. And then just generally next year going into the year, we see the portfolio being a little stronger relative to modest improvement again in occupancy and things for rent and obviously the acquisitions that we’ve made here should be very accretive. And we think that will allow us to continue to grow the dividend next year and at the same time also bring the payout ratio down quite a bit. So we’re cautiously optimistic.  And as for the balance sheet and excess to capital, Paul went through that. We’re very liquid, in a good shape. And don’t have any maturities coming due, as always no mortgages on the property. So to kind of sum things up. The portfolio operating on a normal basis with modest improvement and good acquisitions, and I think with that, we’ll think we’ll have some FFO growth next year. And we’ll open it up for some questions. Mitch, operator if you could do that for us? 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Lindsay Schroll (ph). Go ahead please. 
Lindsay Schroll:  Hi good afternoon. 
Tom Lewis:  Hello Lindsay.
Lindsay Schroll:  Could you talk a little bit about what the competitive landscape looks like for acquisitions? 
Tom Lewis:  Yes, it’s very interesting historically for the company; the biggest competitor obviously has been the 1031 tax-deferred exchange market. And that is much, much quieter than it has been in recent years mostly because there is not a lot of people out there with gains they need to shelter. So on the one-off there is actually a lot less competition than used to be.  In terms of larger transactions, as always there is competition. Generally, if you look over the last 15 years, there has been four or five people out there trying to do larger transactions and today it maybe two or three that are out there, but given that the volume, it’s a little lower than last few years. There is competition that it’s reasonable and at least I think for us we have a cost to capital that allows us to compete effectively. The other area of competition that is very big for the company since we tend to work on these larger, on M&A investment banking type deals. It’s a high yield market. And as we all know the high yield market is very accessible at very good rates today. And I’d say that really is the primary competition that we’re seeing out there today is in the high yield market.  If you saw the high yield markets soften, that probably would be a positive for our acquisitions. 
Lindsay Schroll:  Great, and is there a maximum amount of acquisitions you think you could handle in the year, I mean does that impact sort of your staffing or would it make it sense to bring back Crest at some point? 
Tom Lewis:  Yes, it’s an interesting question. I’m not sure if ever got, one before. But I think it would really come down to the ability to access capital at a substantial spread for us from a manpower standpoint, particularly since the additions we made earlier in the year, we’re setup very well for that and we don’t think that would be a substantial problem. Relative to Crest, while things seemed to have settled down here and interest rates are low and properties can't be sold in the one-off market. I think it’s a volatile enough environment that I wouldn’t anticipate using Crest in large numbers to buy and then sell properties.  I think the risk it might take on relative to mark-to-market if things went the other way would be very difficult. So right now, I think we wouldn’t really want to use Crest very much. But if you look at next year, I mean this year we did close to $700 million, I think we did that one year before. That would be just fine but if we did more than that and capital is available, we’d be happy to do whatever volume we can find that we like from an underwriting standpoint and we can fund it good and clean spreads. 
Lindsay Schroll:  Great, thank you. 
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman. Go ahead please. 
Greg Hannon (ph) – Citi:  Hi it’s Greg Hannon with Michael. 
Tom Lewis:  Hi Greg. 
Paul Meurer:  Hi Greg. 
Greg Hannon – Citi:  Could you guys walkthrough the diligence on the underwriting process as you go through these bigger volumes on these deals? 
Tom Lewis:  Sure, it’s really hasn’t changed all that much. Initially what happens is we’ll generally get in some type of book, small book or just some information that will say here is the measures (ph) the industry, here is the number of properties about how much money they’re looking for. And generally we’re in that industry already. We’ve already comp it, we know who the other players are. We pretty much know what replacement costs are for that type of property and it gives us a starting point. And very quickly we’ll talk for the company, try and get an idea what our plans are and why they’re doing what they’re doing, what they’re looking and do and over what period of time.  And see if we’re going to get there relative to the economic and spread, and that’s kind of a starting point. At that point, what happens is research then gets involved and we get there public financials of the tenant who are public or private. And we get their financials and we go through them, we dart (ph) them which is our internal credit scoring methodology that kind of equates to about 90%, 95% correlation of an S&P rating. So we can get an idea where we keep them from an unscored credit standpoint.  We would also at that point kind of spreadsheet out the properties relative to the price cost per square foot and then we try and get store operating numbers which is the EBITDA of the stores and lay that out and get an idea of what that looks like for rent and so there is an effort there. And then the third part of the property is with a list of where they are, how many square feet and then we start passing that out to the real estate research group to try and start mapping them and getting on the phone and calling the areas and getting some initial sense of value.  And if we can get that together, then it goes to the investment committee which will sit down, take a look at the transaction, get initial idea from a diligent standpoint. If we think it can get to underwriting, and that’s using all three unsecured credit profitability stores and then what the real estate looks like. And that really is a go, no go to perform a more due diligence. And if it’s yes on due diligence then we get much deeper into the company, a lot more work is done on the real estate and ends up coming back in a 20, 30 page report. And an investment committee meeting deciding if we’re going to go to full due diligence. And if it’s a full due diligence that means we think there is a transaction there and that’s one member of the committee its calling off certain research staffs getting on an airplane, flying out meeting with the tenant and trying to get deeper into their operations and finish the unsecured credit underwriting meeting with management.  It’s also then getting a real estate research people out on a plane to visit each one of the properties video them, run demographics, bring that back write it up to in to an individual property report on each one. And then finally making sure that the numbers we get on the properties and what we’re paying are what we look for and then that comes back to committee and comes to yes, we’re going to get there and no we aren’t. And if we are going to get there generally then it flows out of committee and into legal that we’ll start bringing in the people that you work for us there. And start grafting agreement getting to title and moving through the various parts. So it’s pretty standard relative to how it all looks and generally can run anywhere from kind of four weeks up to three or four months depending on what the tenant needs to do. 
Greg Hannon – Citi:  Great, thanks that helps, and then assuming the M&A transaction goes through pro forma for that deal and the 123 you closed subsequent to the quarter end. Will any industry be meaningfully above 20% of rent? 
Tom Lewis:  Not meaningfully no.
Greg Hannon – Citi:  Okay, and then the cap rates spread between the 123 deal, that you’ve closed and the pending deal. Would that be about 1%? 
Tom Lewis:  Separate spread between those two? 
Greg Hannon – Citi:  Between those two. 
Tom Lewis:  No I don’t think so. I think you can kind of get there if you look at what we’ve done through the second quarter and what the cap rate was there or through the third quarter and then blend in what the balance it have to be to get to 8%, that’s darn pretty close. 
Greg Hannon – Citi:  Okay, and then the – I can assume the cash flow coverage is on those two pending deals are in line with the average? 
Tom Lewis:  Pretty standard, yes. 
Greg Hannon – Citi:  Okay, thank you very much. 
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly .Go ahead please. 
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo:  Good afternoon guys. 
Tom Lewis:  Hi Jeff. 
Paul Meurer:  Hi Jeff. 
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo:  Tom, I guess a question for you in cap rates it was helpful you were talking about what you’re seeing in the marketplace, but I’m curious why you think you haven't seen cap rates compress I guess more at least factor, traditionally its very debt sensitive. 
Tom Lewis:  Right. 
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: Products, I think when you look at some of the other property types out there, you see many other property types trading towards the historical low end of the range of what they seen on cap rates and it doesn’t feel like that's the case with at least, if you’re able to kind of hung in there in the 8. 
Tom Lewis:  It did a little bit but I’d also share with you the date of kind of the all-time low for us too. If you look back over the years, I don’t think we’ve had a year below a cap rate then we’re really on the edge of it now. So we see that compression. I also share with you and I think you’ve picked this up on some of the work we’ve done looking at the 1031 market out there, given the lower transaction flow and the lower closed flow a cap rates at some points become a little more anecdotal and looking at the history and listing rates and closing cap rates there can be a pretty good spread for us. Here it’s been us mattering a smaller set for a couple of big transaction that got us to that number.  But you can Jeff, definitely see the impact and I think it’s primarily coming from the high yield markets and so 8% is at the low end for us. 
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: And where I guess when you look at sort of the higher credit tenants out there the traditionally like a Walgreen for examples, years ago you used to see those go substantially below 8%. It’s not unhurt to see some of those transactions in the fives and sixes at one point, I think you pursued them, but where are some of those higher investment grade rated tenants going today on a least basis? 
Tom Lewis:  Yes, I’d say six but just for the value of them they’re used to be really heavily 100% financing things and no yield and but they’re back down there again but a lot of it is little more cash flow panic. They’re low too in the one-offs, if you can get a really good credit where yields are people are jumping at them. 
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: It’s helpful. And then just one question is, I think I asked you guys about it earlier in the year and you touched on it too is, what’s your AFFO dividend coverage, just really looking for an update because year-to-date, its continued to narrow a little bit versus last year and I’m curious with the acquisitions that you’re doing. Do you expect that the stabilize, and begin to turn the other way and I guess do you have something of a target of where you’d like to bring that to in a certain timeframe? 
Tom Lewis:  Yes, if you use AFFO that’s generally a penny or two above our FFO and then what we’ve always done is drove Crest out. So a few years ago when the payout ratio, it probably looked lower to other people than it did to us because you had Crest in there which we did not used to pay dividends but if you look at core FFO and you really get back to about 2005, I think core was about $1.59, the dividend was $1.35, it was about an 85% payout ratio. And ’06 off core was 84% and then you really enter a period kind of ’07, ’08, ’09, and ’010 where FFO was a little flattish. It’s up and quite a bit in ’07 but in ’08, ’09 and ‘010. It’s been flat. And we’ve done modest increases with the dividend. And the dividend for 2010 off core if you guess for $1.82 is about 95% payout ratio.  And we’ve always wanted to payout probably 85 into the low 90s and they’re comfortable there given the stability of the business. However next year if you look at the guidance we put out and if you took it towards the mid upper end, you’re really dropping back down to a 87%, 88% payout ratio and we don’t think that’s a bad thing to do at all. So I think we’ll be able to modestly increase the dividend, but if we hit those numbers brought that payout back to low 80s and operate between 85 and 90 and that’s where I probably like to for a couple of years while we’re all seeing with low interest rates, things stabilize a bit. I’d like to get payout ratio down a little bit and hold it there till we have a little more clarity. 
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo:  And actually just one more question appeared to me, just I’ve asked you on a few calls sort of what’s your view of the future was because service back off so how you’re thinking about leverage, balance sheet and acquisitions. I think year ago I can't remember but quite how you categorize them but it was sort of the Japan like outcome if you will where the decade of the last decade and some of those (inaudible) how you’ve kind of looking at the future right now?
Tom Lewis:  My insights will be every penny you pay for them, which is I think the double-dip scenario which I had pretty high of backed off a little bit. The Japan low growth scenario, I lean a little more heavily towards and while I’d like to see some additional growth, I think it will come with higher interest rates and today I don’t know where you did double-dip 25, probably to Japan 35 and I’ll hope for slow growth but a little inflation on the upside but my first of all little cloudier than others and that leaves me to think that keeping leverage down below 30% which has dropped too here just makes me feel really good and not adding substantially to any near-term debt rollover would be great.  So if we issued debt it would be 10, 12 plus years is we know that permanent preferred sounds great and equity doesn’t sounds bad, but I think generally maintain low leverage through this environment even though interest rates are low if they change them they would likely to do whether its five, six, seven years out that will have an impact on the income statement as you refinance and so you probably want to minimize that. 
Operator:  Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen this concludes today’s conference call. I will turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. 
Tom Lewis:  Well thank you everybody again for joining us during a very busy earnings season and we’ll be interesting to see how the rest of the quarter turns out and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you. And that concludes our call.
Operator:  And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Realty Income third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect and thank you for using ACT Conferencing.

===== 2010 Q2  (2010-07-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Today's presentation all parties will be in a listen only mode. Following the presentation the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions). This conference is being recorded today Thursday, July 29, 2010. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income, please go ahead sir.
Tom Lewis: Thank you Elisa good afternoon everyone and welcome to the conference call where we will review our operations and results for the second quarter and as I am always joined by some people in the room here, Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Mike Pfeiffer, our EVP and General Counsel; John Case our EVP and Chief Investment Officer and Terry Miller, our Vice President, Corporate Communications. And as I always do also during this conference call, we will make certain statements that maybe considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law, the company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. And we’ll disclose in greater detail on the company’s quarterly and on the Form 10-K, the factors that could cause such differences. And Paul will start by reviewing the numbers of the quarter.
Paul Meurer: Thanks Tom as usual let me walk through the financial statements briefly and provide a few highlights of our results for the quarter beginning with the income statement. Total revenue increased $83.5 this quarter versus $81.3 million during the second quarter of 2009. Rental revenue increased 2% overall reflecting new acquisitions over the past year, and some positive thanks to the rent increases for the quarterly period. On the expense side depreciation and amortization expense increased by $742,000 in the comparative quarterly period as depreciation expense naturally increases as our property portfolio continues to grow. Interest expense remains flat at around $21.5 million; we had only $26.9 million in borrowings on our credit facility at quarter end. And on a related note our coverage ratios remain strong with interest coverage at 3.5 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.7 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the second quarter were $6.65 million up from last year but flat from the first quarter of this year. As we mentioned last year due largely to recent hiring and our acquisitions and research department, our current projection for G&A for 2010 is about $26 million or about 7.5% of total revenues. Naturally this will be impacted a bit by the level of acquisitions during the course of the year. Property expenses decreased to under $1.7 million in the comparative quarter and these are the expenses associated with our taxes maintenance and insurance expenses which we are responsible for on the properties we have available for lease. Income taxes consistent income taxes paid to various states by the company and they remained at around $300,000 during the quarter. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled approximately $1.3 million real estate acquired for resale refers to the operations of Crest Net Lease. Crest are a subsidiary that acquires and resells properties. However Crest did not sell any properties in the quarter but overall contributed income or FFO of $158,000. Real estate investment refers to property sales by growth in income from our existing core portfolio. We sold seven properties during the second quarter resulting overall in income of approximately $1.1 million and a reminder of course that these property sales gains are not included in our FFO or in the calculation of our AFFO. Preferred stock cash dividends remained at $6.1 million for the quarter and a net income available to common stock holders was approximately $25 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO was $46.8 million for the quarter and FFO per share was $0.45 per share for the quarter. Our adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or the actual cash that we have available for distribution as dividends was higher at $0.46 per share for the quarter. Our AFFO is usually higher than our FFO each quarter because our capital expenditures are very low and we had very minimal straight line rent in our portfolio. We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter and we have increased the dividend 51 consecutive quarters and 58 times overall since we went public over 15 years ago. Now lets turn to the balance sheet briefly, we have continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure, our debt to total market cap is only 30% in our preferred stock outstanding represents just 6% of our capital structure. We were very please to immediately match fund to the Diageo acquisition last month with $250 million or 5.75% unsecured bond due in 2021. Thus we were left with only $26.9 million of borrowings on our $355 million credit facility at the end of the quarter. This facility also has a $100 million accordion expansion feature. The initial term runs until May 2011, plus thereafter two one-year extension options. Our next bond maturity isn't until 2013. In summary, we currently have excellent liquidity, and our overall balance sheet remains healthy and safe. Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom, who will give some more background.
Tom Lewis: Thanks, Paul. Let me just start with the portfolio and run through the business. The portfolio continued to do pretty well on the second quarter, generally we are hearing from tenants their business have stabilized a bit and we are not hearing much about problems from the tenants relative to the portfolio. At the end of the quarter, the 15 largest tenants get about 54% of revenue. As you know we focus on trying to earn the more profitable properties with tenants and on the top 15 tenants the average cash flow EBITDA per store level was roughly 2.44 times. The rent would then fade and we think that's why occupancy has remained fairly high. We ended the second quarter with 96.2% occupancy and 90 properties available for lease out of our 2350 properties. That occupancy level is down about 50 basis points from the first quarter and about 40 basis points versus the same period a year ago. It's primarily due to getting back 14 Hollywood videos on the last day of the quarter and then some exploration leases also towards the end of the quarter. So then we have 24 new vacancies and then had 11 vacant properties that were leased or sold. And that's the reason for the slight decline in occupancy, it's still very high but off a bit this quarter. Same store rents in the portfolio increased 0.1% during the second quarter, that compares to 0.8% in the first quarter and 0.5% in the same period a year ago, so little lower in same store rent also. And if you kind of look across the different industries we are in relative to where the contribution, either declines or increases came from 8 and our other category and industries had declining same store rent. The tire industry was the primary corporate there, primarily with one tenant that was over half of it. And then after that the rest of the numbers were fairly small. But together the nine categories were $476,000 and rent decline, there were four different industries that had flat rent and then 18 during the quarter that's saw same store rent increases. There really wasn't any dominant one but it was pretty broad based with the larger numbers being in the auto service, health and fitness, child care, convenience stores and in the theatre business. And the 18 different industries together had a total increase about $578,000, so net-net just about over $100,000 gain for the quarter. Small increase in same store rent but obviously positive. And I think if you look at the portfolio with occupancy declining a little bit and fairly modest same store rent increases. I think what we are seeing in the portfolio right now and I give the caveat of asset double dip is that we are probably looking this summer is being the trough really in this latest cycle of recession in the portfolio. And then I think looking into the third and fourth quarter what we are likely to see is same store rents picking up a bit. And also vacancy reducing little bit occupancy going up, in recent years probably the last two three same store rents have been little lower than typical and most years we have run 1% to 2% and we have been a bit behind that. That 's been impacted by rent reductions from just a few tenants who have some issues and if you look at the numbers there are really only two tenants that are in the comp numbers on that. The main one is Big 10 Tires which is tenant; we had some issues with last year. They will go out of comp numbers in the fourth quarter. The other tenant is much smaller impact, they will go out in the second quarter, which mean we likely to see some additional increases in same store rents going into the third and fourth quarter. But I think moving in the next year probably backup into 1% to 2% range in same store rent growth. I think also more interesting is we are seeing more broader based increases kind of across the portfolio. On the vacancy front, I mentioned we got back 14 Hollywood videos literally on the last date of second quarter. We have I think just five more and that will be it for Hollywood because we had 23 that we will be getting back and after that looking at the watch list again there is really not that much going on. So my sense is looking at occupancy, we are probably seeing it being flat to up in the third quarter and then probably up a little bit in the fourth. And my sense is that we’ll probably see a bounce back on that in the next year that's pretty good. And if you couple that with the bounce back in the same-store rent increases, and I think we are likely seeing what is probably some good portfolio performance moving into 2011. And maybe it's good to take a moment, kind of look back over the last three years or so and kind of sale through this in pretty good shape. Occupancy has remained above 96%, same-store rent has been up each of the quarter. Yes, during the last three years, we did have nine tenant events which were five sector 11s, two chapter 7s and then two different tenants where we have rent reductions where we’ve participated with some other creditors in making sure that they could move ahead. And when we added all up, we lost about $0.11 per share in reoccurring FFO from these nine events. Fortunately that was pretty much completely offset by rent increases from other tenants and during the period we also did very little acquisition activity and when you put that together then basically through this period, flat earnings and I think sale through given the depth of what we saw the last year pretty well and now we are positioned where this summer would be the bottom hopefully and then 2011 looks pretty good. And if we can add some acquisitions to it, I think we should be able to grow both the top and bottom line at a decent clip next year. Relative to the diversification as I mentioned there is 2350 properties in the portfolio, that’s up six from last quarter. We now have 32 retail industries in the portfolio and a 118 different chain and believe we are in 49 states. Looking at industry concentration, restaurants is the largest industry at 20.8%, that's down a bit from the end of last year, and also from last quarter and we will continue to work that down as we are not looking at acquisitions in that sector. Convenience stores were 17.2%, that's up a bit, that's due primarily to rent increases, theaters are at 9.1% which is doing very well. Our major tenant there, Kerasotes theaters if you see, in the press release has disappeared from the top 15 tenants as they were acquired during the quarter by AMC Theaters which we think is a net credit positive for us. Our largest tenant is about 5.9% of rent, that’s L.A. Fitness. Again the 15 largest tenants are about 54% of rent and when you get to tenant number 15, you are down around 2% of rental income and then it moves down pretty quickly after that. I would note that this quarter from a geographic standpoint with the Diageo transaction, California in the next quarter will become our largest state at about 11.7% of our revenue. And it's interesting, normally you would say I think, okay the company has a larger exposure to the California economy, but I think given the Diageo transaction, a majority of their revenue is generated on a national basis rather than state basis. So I think it's a bit different than if we’d bought a bunch of stores in California. It's going to be a bigger percentage, but relative to the exposure to the California economy and it's not quite a symmetrical impact. But that number will go up next quarter. Anyway we remain fairly well diversified and the average lease linked in the portfolio is at 11.4 years. So we are pleased given what's going on with the performance of the portfolio. Moving on to acquisitions, obviously during the second quarter, we completed the majority of the Diageo acquisition. We also did a couple of other properties, so it was 13 properties for $261 million at average going in the yield of 7.5%. As Paul mentioned, we simultaneously financed majority of it with a $250 million 10-year note at around 58 which a lot of the lock in some pretty attractive spreads about a 170 basis points upfront. And that should accelerate as the leases all have increases in them. With these transactions, we obviously worked up the credit curve with Diageo. So we had a lower initial rate given where the credit markets were, we were able to step in and I think put some pretty good spreads together. For the first six months, then that gave us $289 million of acquisitions. We have one more piece of about $11 million that will close in the third quarter in the Diageo transaction. That puts us at about $300 million for the year. So it looks like we are growing at a nice clip here. Relative to the market overall, we continue to see a pretty good volume of transactions in the market place and that includes larger transactions to work on. Obviously we have the vast majority of the line available and the capital markets remain open, so we think we have the capital and this is a pretty good opportunity to go out and acquire. Relative to caps rate, I think they have continued to soften a little bit which to some extent explains why some of the sellers who are coming back into the market, and obviously likely a reflection of where the credit markets are and low rates out there. Our guess is most transactions probably be in the 8% to 9% cap rate range which is just a little bit lower, but again we have faster capital being cheaper than it was, I think spreads have been maintained in a pretty good time to acquire out there even if cap rates have come off a little bit. But we are very positive relative to the opportunity to do some acquisitions here. On guidance, for 2010, we’ll stay with the 184 to 186, that’s obviously flat to up about 1% in FFO and as the acquisitions have started to grow here, the top line again is moving up. As Paul mentioned to date, that has not hit the bottom line primarily to the additional G&A and primarily on the staff side and we think that will be the case going through the balance of the year. We have added a number of people. We will probably add a few more, not a lot and then CG&A likely stabilize as we get to the end of the year and hopefully with the acquisitions that we’re doing and we’ll continue to do, we’ll have that top line growth go to the bottom line over the next year or so. For 2011 then, we’re estimating FFO at $1.96 to $2 per share, that’s 5% to 8% growth for next year and again, what I said earlier relative to, we think occupancy will come back a bit in same-store rent and if we’re able to add in some acquisitions, that should give us some good growth. Paul mentioned the balance sheet is in good shape, we’re very liquid. So overall, I think good stability in the portfolio and a little bit more optimistic about growth going forward. And with that, if can, we’ll still go ahead and open it up to questions at this point.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey Donnelly: I forget if you just, quarterly sales, financials from your tenants booked, what's been the progression in unit levels, [casual] coverages over the past year or so. Have you see a bottom or an inflection in that metric?
Tom Lewis: You know it's been pretty stable but it's throughout the last couple of years, but it's not the way you want to see stability. What happened is we were up around a 2, 7 forecast low coverage on the top 15 if you go back three years ago and it was dropping down into the 2-3s, 2-2s and if you look at the nine tenants that had credit events, one of the things that we did with them is adjust rents and the rents were adjusted down to get the cash flow coverage back up to a good level. At the same time though, we were able to put in the majority of the leases, some type of recapture clause of the business increases we can get part of that. So I think what you would have seen Jeff is kind of 274 down into the 2-2s and 2-3s but with the adjustments that took it back up into the kind of the 2-4 level and that’s kind of where they sit today as 2-4-4. So we saw the real down draft going back over 18 to 24 months, but really over the last. I think starting in the third quarter last year, we started to see them flatten out and a few have seen the they're in the docking chain continuing to slide a bit but that was offset by the ones going up.
Jeffrey Donnelly: And if I could switch gears and ask a few questions on Diageo, by my math, it goes right from the first deal that you guys had done where the operating income of the actual assets, the property rent if you will. You know is it enough to, justify the rent that was paid to you guys, it certainly makes you more realigned on the credit of the entity. Fortunately, that’s wrong in this case. Is the catalyst sort of deal implied and your just not seeing attractive pricing elsewhere in the traditional net lease business, that’s why you guys went after it or?
Tom Lewis: There are transactions out there and I think, we have looked at the wine business a number of years ago and as we did our due diligence, we ended thinking that there were relevantly few opportunities because of kind of how we have to underwrite the business and I’ll go into detail if you want me to but the long and short of it is when this came up, given the work that we had done a few years ago and kind of the criteria we had come up and said, there’s only going to be a couple or three players that we would probably want to do something whether it is in this industry. We identified and again, this is a few years ago kind of constellation brands, Diageo and Fortune brands and then Fortune brands sold their business to someone else and when this came with Diageo, we knew who they were. We absolutely knew the assets both the vineries and the vineyards ahead of time and given where spreads are and where we thought we could work, we thought it’d be a nice addition. But it really does rely to a great extent on the credit and the due diligence as you know, we’re normally looking what you related to that the EBITDA on the real estate that we’re buying is generated for the tenants that they have to have the real estate to do it and typically if you look at this business, you can tie EBITDA to a vinery and the wine they produce and sell but its harder to do with the vineyards because a lot of the grape juice really is grown. It is bought rather than grown and so hypothetically in chapter 11, if you have a vinery with some vineyards, what they could do is, if the vineyards weren’t extremely important to their wine brand, is they could reject the vineyards and the bankruptcy, keep the vinery and then go third party to buy the grapes and so that made it a little more difficult. That led us to really take a look and say okay, the vineyards are going to have to be in some very special areas where it’s a strong premium brand and they have to label it a state bottle, which means that it needs to be grown right there or NAPA, which we should get a premium price for or some of the appellations in NAPA like Rutherford or Oakville or some of the others. But if you just took the vineyards and their cash flow coverage, you could look at the income that would be provided. You probably couldn’t get comfortable there. You say okay, if I believe that the vineyards are then tied to the vinery and they need them, I can look at the cash flow coverages for the real estate buy as a function of what they’re making on their wines and then you can go okay, I can get more comfortable and then as you are in this case, if you’re looking at a wine company with 15 brands, you might say I’d get even more comfortable, but as we look at this business and its volatility and the structure of it and we did spend quite a bit of time, we really said we’re going to have to work with a very large players with multiple cash flows or its not going to make sense for us. But fortunately, when we kind of predetermined all of that a while back and then walked away from the business, we talked parked the research and when this came up, we very quickly, I mean as soon as we saw what it was, we thought we could get there and it turned out we could.
Jeffrey Donnelly: I’m curious, are there provisions in the spring and say are required in order to maintain certain credit metrics or penalties compelling to do so and what was the reaction from the rating agencies, because there is a chunk your dealing with and you guys normally go after?
Tom Lewis: Right. We’ve done a number of deals this size, so we’re comfortable with that but the reaction from the rating agencies was very positive given who the tenant is and how their business and given these brands and these assets and so I think the reaction was very positive there. None of our leases that I can remember require the tenant to maintain certain credit statistics, that is relevantly unheard of in the triple net lease business and I think its just kind of a non starter. But in this case, given these particular assets and I’ve spent a great deal of time up in that area and if you follow this business. In Napa, California freezes over 90% of the wine in the US Napa is one of 16 areas in California and it produces only about 4% of the wine in the US. But if you look at the prices that they get for the grapes and the wine up there, the average price for a ton of Tavern A grapes last year in California was about a $1,078 and it ranged anywhere from $300 at the lowest turn, that’s the lowest for the 16 reasons up to Napa, where it $4,777 a ton. And so, when you start looking up into that area and you start looking at the growth in new vineyards and Napa is not even about 1% a year because they put restrictions on it and a lot of the premium brands operate up there and there’s a minimum amount of vineyards for those premium brands to buy. We got a little more comfortable and I think they did too with a particular assets that we bought and also that they’d been in production. They said that these were the vineyards now for 25 to a 100 years and I think then coupling it into those two brands and one’s a 100 year old brand and the other one’s a 40 year old brand and that’s got them comfortable relative to what we’ve purchased and what we’ve paid but then it really, and this has been said by a lot of people and its true, then it really is a credit story getting a very long term lease with a very good company.
Jeffrey Donnelly: And then just a last question, normally a quick one, and I just look into the answer but did you guys consider buying a long term hedge on Diageo credit? You know aside from maybe Tom increasing his consumption of wine?
Tom Lewis: We did increase the consumption of wine and since you wanted a short answer, the answer is no.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies & Company. Please go ahead.
Tayo Okusanya: Yes, good afternoon Tom. Lets take up the questions. In regards and different resale categories involved in, do you talk usually about categories where you thought overall underlined trends for the tenants who are principally strong and the categories where there was some weakness, even if that stuff is not on your watch list at this point?
Tom Lewis: Sure, let me take a minute and try and do that. I think if you divide up our portfolio, the majority of it is basic human needs, low price points and that’s done better than stuff that’s at the higher end. So I’ll start with really kind of a negative side. It is a small component in the portfolio, little over 2% of rent which is a tenant that is in the RV business and that was just a really, really business that got hit terribly hard over the last couple of years, given the consumer durable and high ticket. And if you look at industry volumes, in 2008 the volume of RV sales in the United States went up by about a third and then it did again in 2009. And so that was an area that we were pretty deeply concerned with and we went in and worked with the tenant on some rent relief. That business has not gotten back up to peaks, but it’s stabilized, guess for this year is shipment. That were down as well, it’s 159,000 units, they are going to be up over 200,000. So but that's one we continue to watch, but we were fortunate that our tenants there kind of has several lines of revenue. One is the sale of RVs, the other one is that they do sell pretty much, it's an RV superstore that they sell anything to people who use RV and then they also have a service component. But that's one that’s been tough. Restaurant, is another obvious one, that's about 20% of rent and if you look at our portfolio, about 8% of the 20 or almost half is fast food and that has held up relatively well as the consumer traded down. But not as the consumers come back a little bit, their businesses have slowed a little bit. But the casual dining, that is really the other side of that was hit very, very hard. And that was evidenced by Buffets and a few other tenants that we worked with. And it's still not great and we continue to watch that, but it’s stabilized a bit. The other area that typically, and we have been in this business for 30 years, has done very well under recession as the Child Day Care. And they had a little more same-store rent declines than they normally would have in their business and margin decline and I think it's over the years as government has got more and more into their business. Now 20% to 25% of the for pay child care business is  paid for out of government transfer payments, and I think that some of those people have looked through the budget constraints in city, state and local government and that's been a little tougher business. So those are three that when we look to are the ones that we worry a little more about. You didn't look as convenient store business and it can have some volatility, really is function of gas margins and there’s been a little bit sales come off a little bit in the store, but that business is very consistent and holds up as a lot of M&A activity and so there’s opportunities there and we like that business and then if you look at auto service, auto tire, that is one where we initially their business softened a bit going into the recession. But now has come back because they are not buying new cars, eventually the after service are buying new tires, and those have come back. So those are kind of the key components, theaters have held up real well. Health and fitness has held up extremely well, those are about cheap entertainment, and then I think you are getting into some pretty small concentrations relative to the portfolio.
Tayo Okusanya: Well, that's helpful. And then with Diageo, just kind of given the cap rate you guys provided for you second quarter acquisition. I guess it's safe to assume that you have done close to a 7.5 cap as well?
Tom Lewis: Yes, they were the majority of the acquisitions there. And it is lower, but again being to step in and finance it with the bond offering was very attractive and I think the arbitrage between where the long-term debt of the same tenant is trading and where the transaction was done made it pretty attractive.
Tayo Okusanya: And then rent coverage of 2.04, could you talk a little bit about the discretion of that number at this point, is this still pretty much, everything all kind of tied close to that number or is it the range kind of broaden out a bit.
Tom Lewis: That's pretty a good bell curve. I would say going back two three years ago, the lowest out there was about a two which was extraordinarily comfortable. Today we are looking at about a 1.59 on the low side and 3.53 on the high side. And there are really only a couple of tenants in the top 15 that are down into the 1s, but you can be somewhat comfortable when you get 1.5 above because as we have now done over 1067 rollovers at the end of leases, our experience has been if you got a 1.5 coverage, you have the tenant that is making enough money on that unit where they are going want it. And that's the bottom tenant is just really right around 1.5.
Tayo Okusanya: That’s the RV guy or no?
Tom Lewis: No.
Tayo Okusanya: Okay.
Tom Lewis: I can't discuss their financials and EBITDA, or they weren’t given to me.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Rich Moore: On the Diageo acquisition, Paul what was the charge actually, the acquisition expense on that within G&A?
Paul Meurer: Not very high, so it will be disclosed in our Q that comes out later today, but for the second quarter, our total acquisition related expense is that for FAS 141R that we needed to expense was $40,000. Those numbers are going to be quite variable, it's going to depend on particular transactions in terms of who pays for what expenses. Whether there is transfer taxes involved in different states. So we have a portfolio that involves multiple states and for whatever reasons there is lots of expenses that we need to pay for it as opposed to the tenant taking care of. It could be a much higher number. In this case, that was not the case. Diageo had already done a lot of work to prepare for the offering.
Tom Lewis: That's another way of saying that the G&A was actually in people and the things we are trying to do here to grow the business, not really on the property expense side.
Rich Moore: Tom as I understand you really don't have any bankruptcy concerns at the moment other than obviously Hollywood?
Tom Lewis: Right, while being in the credit business, you are always concerned, but no there is nobody right now that's on the watch list that we think is eminent or we see some substantial problem with and that’s a very different case in the last three years whether it be a couple of three names sitting on the watch list at any given time.
Rich Moore: Thinking about Hollywood for a second. How would you characterize those locations considering I usually think about Hollywood is having pretty strong, that sort of industry even having strong locations to release. I mean would you characterize these in that manner, maybe stronger than the typical tenants that you have or is that not true?
Tom Lewis: Well that’s interesting. Normally, you wouldn’t think that and when we bought these, there was a huge amount of development, these lease were brought 10 or 11 years ago by both Blockbuster and Hollywood and so we looked at a lot of units and selected just one package, bought at one time and off the top, these are about 8,000 sq ft buildings, are on one to two acres of land. We paid a $1 million to a $1.4 million and they are mostly outpad types to (inaudible) good traffic. Rents when we brought them were about 16 a foot and they’ve grew to 19 a foot and when they had their Chapter 11 a couple of years ago, the recovery rate was pretty good and they weren’t that difficult to lease. The problem in the business right now is while they are good assets, there is an awful lot of video stores to release out there. If you just take Hollywood and then just some of the other change that would have problems. So there’s really blood on the market, we’re seeing good activity but I think the rent spreads are going to drop pretty dramatically there and we have received 23 of these, we’ve got 18 back to date and I think we’ve got five to go and we have a lot of activity, but that will be a hit there, but we’ve gotten out the numbers.
Rich Moore: On the restaurants, it sounds like you are pretty actively bringing that down. Is that accuracy, you are going to probably sell off more of the restaurants in the next few quarters?
Tom Lewis: We are selling a little bit and if we get anything new, it would be with an existing tenant and one little unit here or there but essentially not buying and we are selling a few but the other thing is if you look at the two tenants that are still in the same store comp numbers, one of them is a restaurant and that’s where some of the rent came down.
Rich Moore: Ok I got you and then as far as acquisitions go, any particular category, obviously beyond wines, is exciting for you?
Tom Lewis: You know its pretty broad based, I would be surprised if we’re not back into some of our existing areas that we’ve invested in on the next few acquisitions. We’re out looking a couple of three new things that will comment on when we finally get something or work on but my chances probably the balance of the year will probably be back in kind of the core stuff.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of (inaudible). Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: What do you think happens with area finance?
Tom Lewis: I don't know and I wouldn’t speculate. We obviously knew Chris and Mart very well and some a lot in the last couple of years. We’ve talked to them a little bit, but haven’t been deeply involved and obviously, we wouldn’t comment on anything we were looking at, be an individual or a larger type transaction. I’d only go back and this is, its not on spared, its generic. We’ve been offered a lot of companies over the years and generically, its kind of difficult to do M&A in our opinion in this business and that’s the function that we spend so much time on underwriting and then when something comes along to have to underwrite a large package all at once is problematic and that’s been the case, I actually I don't know.
Unidentified Analyst: But you won't comment, I guess, what you’re working on. Will you comment on what you’re not working on?
Tom Lewis: No because then if we weren’t working on something and you asked me, I said yes. Next time when you ask me if we were working on something, then you’d be able to identify it. So I think if we are working, it is yes, it’s no comment and if we weren’t, it’s no comment and if we were looking at it, but not interested, it would be no comment and if we weren’t looking at it but interested, it’d be no comment.
Unidentified Analyst: You’ve made a couple of hires in 2010, obviously bringing John on board. Should we read in any way, shape or form into that as you are starting to have succession planning costs? Does that have any bearing on the hires you’ve made?
Tom Lewis: Interesting there is no relative to me, no succession thoughts at the moment, so no. But relative to the hires we make ,yes. Well one of the things that we’re doing is we have a strategic planning program and a major emphasis of that is leadership development and that’s really looking at the company and doing an organization chart for five years from now and 10 years from now and trying to look at where are people that are in the organization today, that are likely to move away over that period of time and then looking inhouse and developing people and then also going outside to get some talent, either for that reason or variety. The advance in general you might looking to go anywhere in the new future, the answer is no and I don’t think any of our senior officers are in that mode at the moment.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Fenton with Credit Suisse.
Andrew Fenton: I was just thinking as the economy picks up, do you see activity at Crest picking up or do you think that stay dormant?
Tom Lewis: If it does kind of only on a marginal basis, we got Crest obviously because we saw a lot of risks there and the timing worked out perfectly and Crest was really valuable since we started in 2000, when it was competitive atmosphere and we bought large portfolios and wanted to sell off part of them. There are a lot of people who have exited our business, probably more than the deal flow has dropped and so to date, we haven’t had to buy a lot in a transaction that we didn’t want to own and we haven’t had to do it and so as long as we don’t have to do that, that was the only reason we were using Crest. It wasn’t a side business to make a buck. While we made money, it was really so we could work on large transactions and sell off a bit. If down the road it became the case where we needed to do that, I think we’d take a long hard look about our confidence in the economy and in the number of buyers out there for that type of property, before you’d add much inventory because I think it’s a lot riskier business than it looked like for about seven eight years, we were aware of that. We were in a period of declining cap rates and it made anybody who flipped or did this type of business. Later, it looked like a very easy business, but in normal times with relatively stable cap rates, it’s a tough business and an easy business to get caught in. So we’d like to minimize what we do there unless we’re absolutely forced to, based on competition and acquisition.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. I will turn the call over to management for concluding remarks.
Tom Lewis: Well thank you very much everybody and in the end, a pretty solid in the portfolio. Now let’s see if we can start moving the top and bottom line and thank you for taking the time to be on the call and we’ll talk to you next quarter, thank you.

===== 2010 Q1  (2010-04-29 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Tom Lewis - CEO Paul Meurer - Executive Vice President and CFO
Analysts: Greg Sweitzer - Citigroup Chris Lucas - Robert W. Baird Jeffrey Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets
Operator: Welcome to the Realty Income first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator instructions) This conference is being recorded today, Thursday, April 29, 2010. And now I'd like to turn the conference over to Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.
Tom Lewis : Thank you, Alicia [ph], and good afternoon everyone, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me in the room today is Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Pfeiffer, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and Terry Miller, our Vice President of Corporate Communications. And as I am obligated to say that during this conference call, we will make certain statements that maybe considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law, and the Company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. And we’ll disclose in greater detail on the Company’s quarterly and on the Form 10-K, the factors that could cause such differences. And with that, we have Paul, review the numbers. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Tom. As usual, I’ll just briefly walk through our financial statements and provide a few highlights of our financial results for the past quarter, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased to $83.3 million this quarter versus $82.5 million during the first quarter of 2009. Rental revenue increased 1% overall, while same-store rents increased 0.8% for the quarterly period. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $492,000 in the comparative period as depreciation expense increases naturally as our property portfolio does grow. Interest expense remained flat at around $21.4 million. We had only $39.9 million of borrowings on our credit facility at quarter end. And on a related note our coverage ratios remain strong, with interest coverage at 3.5 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.7 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the first quarter were $6.7 million. Our current projection for G&A for 2010 is about $26 million or about 7.5% of total revenues because this would naturally be impacted by the level of acquisitions during the year. Our acquisition related costs are now included in G&A expense. As per FAS 141R, in the first quarter, this expenses per FAS 141R totaled $48,000. Property expenses remain flat at about $2.2 million for the comparative quarter and these expenses are primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance and insurance expenses, which we are responsible for on properties available for lease. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the Company and they remained at around $300,000 for the quarter. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $754,000. Real estate acquired for resale refers to the operations of Crest Net Lease our subsidiary that acquires and resale properties. Crest did not sale any properties in the quarter but overall contributed income or FFO of just over $200,000. Real estate held for investment refers to property sales by Realty Income from our existing core portfolio. We did sell three properties during the quarter, resulting overall in income of approximately $548,000. And these property sales gains are not included in our FFO or in our AFFO calculation. Preferred stock cash dividends remained at $6.1 million for the quarter, net income available to common stockholders was $24.1 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO remained at around $46.7 million for the quarter and FFO per share was again $0.45 per share for the comparative quarter. Adjusted funds from operations or AFFO for the actual cash available for distribution as dividends was higher at $0.46 per share for the quarter. Our FFO is usually higher than our FFO each quarter because our capital expenditures are very low and we have very minimum straight line rent in our portfolio. We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter. We have increased the dividend 50 consecutive quarter and 57 times overall since we went public over 15 years ago. Now, let's turn to the balance sheet. We've continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. Our debt-to-total market capitalization is only 28%, and our preferred stock outstanding represents just 7% of our capital structure. As I mentioned we only had $39.9 million of borrowings on our $355 million credit facility. This facility also has a $100 million accordion expansion feature. The initial term runs until May 2011, but has two one-year extension options thereafter. Our next bond maturity date is until 2013. And in summary, we currently have excellent liquidity and our overall balance sheet remains healthy and safe. And now let me turn the call back to Tom, who will give you little bit more background.
Tom Lewis: Thanks, Paul. And I will just jump into the portfolio. Obviously, the portfolio did pretty well during the first quarter, very stable. I think our conversations with tenants generally to see their business being the little bit better that the consumer maybe as opened up to little bit even to some of the discretionary type items and I won't say everybody is ebullient, but there is a little better tone and pretty much across the board with a lot of the tenants which is nice to see. At the end of the quarter our 15 largest tenants comprised to about 53% of our business. And as is the custom we owned tended down to more profitable stores and cash flow coverage. EBITDA at the store level is still ranging around 2.5 times and little better than last quarter but there is not much movement. And obviously tending down to more profitable stores has been something that's worked for us in the past. We ended the third quarter with 96.7% occupancy. 77 properties available for lease that's out of 2,344 and that occupancy was down 10 basis points from the fourth quarter but up 30 basis points from the same period year ago and remains fairly high. Same-store rents jumped up a bit for the quarter to 0.8%. That's slightly higher than the fourth quarter and then compares up – I think 0.2% a year ago. So, better there. And to give you an idea where the increases and decreases are coming from which may point to some trends or may not. Six of our 30 industries, I'd say six and our other category have rental declines. Tire stores were about half of it. And then, as many of you know, we own one industrial property in San Diego and its rents were down about 15% over a year ago. But if you take the declines in those kind of seven industries together it was down about 620,000. That four industries that were flat, apparel, office supplies, equipment rental and travel plazas. And then there were about 20 in the portfolio that did see same-store rent increases. The biggest increases interesting rental came from restaurants, our convenient stores and child care and each one of those individually saw rents go up about $250,000. And then the auto service, theater, health club, some of the other areas that we're invested in, had some modest increases and a handful for the rest of them have fairly small increases. Is nice to see rents going up on restaurants, again, it's been while some steps in the case but the 20 together have rent increases about 1.2 million and that brought us to the net gain of about 615,000 on same store rent. We continue to be pretty well diversified we've 2,344 properties in the portfolio that’s up five from the end of the year, still 30 industries, 118 different chains in 49 states. Our largest exposure by an industry standpoint continues to be restaurants, that was 21.9% at the end of the quarter, which was up a bit from year-end but we did not buy anything in the restaurant category that really just came from the rent increases, I talked about a moment ago. Convenience stores were up 17% as also a function of rent increases, we didn’t buy any convenient stores during the quarter. Theaters at 9.1%, its doing very well, and then child care and health and fitness were both about 6.8%. Our largest tenant is at 6.1% that’s LA Fitness, which is up due to some additional acquisitions we've made in the fourth quarter and also a couple of year in the first quarter. And if you then take the going down the lease to the 15 top tenants that comprise about 63%, when you get to number 15, you're down to about 2% of revenues, so we continue to be fairly well diversified and the lease length continues to have the good term on it, we’re sitting just about as 11 years right now. So, the portfolio did pretty good during the quarter, very stable and nice to see the stabilization continue and rates, occupancy rates remain pretty high. Let me move on for a moment to property acquisitions. During the quarter, we had a number of opportunities to look at and we've brought eight new properties for 28 million. The acquisitions were with two tenants, one in the automotive service business and then again in the health and fitness business, all of these had triple net leases with an average length of 18.2 years starting cash-on-cash cap rates of 9% and then all of them also had opportunities for those lease yields to increase as time goes on and obviously pretty good spreads with that rate. I mentioned, we had lot of things to look at during the quarter and I would say that we continue to see modestly the number of transactions that are out in the marketplace kick up. And also talking to the people that are kind of in the deal flow that we talked to on a regular basis that seems to be more discussions with our company's and entities about coming out and looking at sale lease back so. We think, we will continue to modestly pick up, certainly not a flood but sellers seem to be returning to the market. I think there are number of reasons for that just time has going on and also cap rates are beginning to soften and I think that explain some of the sellers coming back because one way to end a bit get as spread is that people on each side moderate their expectations and cap rates softening just a bit I think its bringing more people back. And we saw that not only what we bought but in terms of kind of what was out there in the market, we either didn’t do or was shown to the market. And I think its also reflected last quarter I talked about looking at bonds spreads as kind of a proxy for looking at where pricing and volume could be and I was looking at bond spreads with double B [ph] and be the other day and I think just absolutely past in a year ago double B bond spreads in the high yield market where about 910 basis points and when I look that on the other day, I think the average was about 419 and if you look at single B spreads a year ago there were up around 1200 basis points that are come into about 577. So I think, in almost all areas of the financial markets, you seen yields borrowing, and I think that’s reflective of having some impact on cap rates although cap rates tend for lag. I think the other though obviously is, if you look at cap rates come in bit, our cost to capital has also come in, obviously, the equity has performed very well and that brings in the cost of issuance. If you look at debt today, debt is very attractively priced I think for a lot of rates and certainly it would be for us we’re told and even preferred as fairly well priced. So, even though there has been some softening in cap rates I think spreads are very, very attractive for acquisitions out there in the market. Every quarterly kind of try and give a feel for the acquisitions market what we are trying to see. And I think maybe a good way to address that is as we look at the business today, just by being out there in the marketplace and obviously being well capitalized most of the folks in this industry know that we’re out buying again. And I think just by saying we’re buying, we can pretty much look at $15 million, $20 million, $30 million that seems to come through the door every quarter in acquisitions, mostly in kind of small transactions or one-offs, and that’s kind of gets us to run-rate really about $100 million or more and that’s kind of where are running, where we see just enough transactions come in, so we are able to do that. The other thing that didn’t happen and this why it gets hard to predict is, each year it seems when we are out, we’re active somewhere between two or three or four or five or six larger transactions down the pipe that you end up working on. And the question is whether you close none of them, in which case your run-rate to the 100 one of them, two of them, three of them in which case your over 250 million, or whether several of those in size hit and then acquisitions are much bigger than you thought, and that’s really where we are today. I call tell you during the first quarter we worked on a couple larger transactions, didn’t do them. We continue to work on a couple here but as to whether they’ll come to fruition or not we really don’t know. So it does make -- I think trying to predict a little harder but I’ll tell you it’s definitely a better flow of the larger ones that are coming down the pipe to work on. And my experience is that does lead you to, to most often having one or more of those come true, but again we don’t know. But we are seeing more of the larger ones. I also mentioned in the press release, the hiring of John Case is our new EVP and Chief Investment Officer. Within John’s leadership, we have good impact on that department and on our acquisition efforts over time. He’s just joined the company this week. But, I also think that we are going to probably add another acquisition officer too. We’ve just gone through a recruiting class for associates held on campus, and adding a few people there and we’ve also made an additional research. So this year, I think we are going to add additional staff to kind of ramp-up our efforts here and hopefully down the road, that will pay some dividends for us. But I would look for additional acquisition activity this year. Relative to guidance for 2010, we are staying with the 186 to 192 or, you know, 1.1% to a little over 4% of that overall and that assumes relative stability in the portfolio, which is what we’ve seen lately. And at this point I think a 100 to 250 million of acquisitions. Now, withstanding the comments I just made in terms of larger transactions, but it’s also important relative to the 2010 numbers, when those acquisitions come in the quarter, our experience is they come -- tend to come in later in the quarter and that heavily impact this year’s number. However, obviously, for next years’ numbers, all acquisitions we get this year to really regardless of where they are going to impact the numbers next year. I would also say that, I think our guidance that to hit the middle or upper-end of our guiding range, I think it will take more of a contribution from acquisitions and to do that over the next couple of quarters here in 2010. I think that’s too primarily to some additional G&A most of that on the staffing side. And we estimate that the G&A is going to climb a bit this year. We have been running for the last couple years down under 6% of revenues with G&A but this year adding, I think probably 5 or 6 people. Our sense is, is the G&A is going to run about 7.5% of revenues, which is obviously higher. I still think it; it puts us in pretty good step for other people in our business. But as you recall late in 2007 we made a number of decisions to kind of stop acquisition and liquid across [ph] raised capital and at that time we reduced staff a bit that kind of pattern down the hatches and we ran the business very lean. And I think looking now when things beginning to open up its time that we, we ramp-up some people and some staff and try to take advantage of the market that we think maybe coming out there and that’s what leads us to have the higher G&A. The balance sheet remains in good shape as Paul mentioned we have made about $40 million on the line and no debt coming due, no mortgages so pretty simple balance sheet and pretty liquid and our accessed capital I think is clearly available for the company out there at very good prices. As to dividends obviously we think dividends will be higher this year than last year and that’s our plan for next year also to have them go up. So I’ll just summarize by saying a stable portfolio balance sheet in good shape. And we’re going to try and make some headway this year on the acquisitions and people can access some capital later on the year when we do that and grow the business. And with that, I Elisha [ph], I will open it up for questions.
Operator:
Greg Sweitzer – Citigroup: For Michael Bilerman [inaudible] as well.
Tom Lewis: Okay. Hi, Greg.
Paul Meurer:
 : Hi, Greg.
Greg Sweitzer – Citigroup: Tom, you talked about deals modestly picking up and that is on the larger ones, is that is for a couple of months now. In your view, how will the deal environment has evolved say yes, or no. How far do you think we are from tighter spreads and more of the buyout type product measuring [ph] and intensity when demand picking up?
Tom Lewis: It's hard to know obviously when you are looking into the future. The one thing I’d been kind of surprised that is more M&A talk. Be that private equity or one individual buying another. And so if you look at the kind of the larger transactions, we've seen come by, I think a bunch of them are little more M&A oriented which is pretty gone away. And so I think if the economy continues to get a little bit better and if the capital markets are open, you’re probably going to see it generated from that. And then, secondarily there’s just been some companies come out and I wouldn’t say these are people who really have balance sheet problems, but folks who are saying, I’d like to take advantage of this market now and do something. But I still haven't seen the flood [ph] that was call for of the people that really are kind of desperate to do some refinance. And I think as long as the capital market stay open here, that might be slowed a little bit by their access to capital in other areas, but I hope that they would do what a lot of people in the real world [ph] did, but take advantage of it, pick it the right size for the balance sheet. So, my sense is I don’t know where the future is, you kind of got to look at scenarios and this moving along slowly and with a lot of liquidity out there I think we’ll keep cap rates moderating a bit. And I think cause volume to increase but it's not the big proliferation jump back up and spread is tighten, I actually think you might get maybe deal flow moderate a little bit, but you might get a lot of higher rates.
Greg Sweitzer – Citigroup: Okay. And could you provide a little detail on what you’re seeing with respect to the loan across a credit card and for the deals that are on the market today. You know, maybe where the most competition is and how well that CapEx rate is between higher decent deals and across the credit spectrum?
Tom Lewis: Yes. You know, it’s interesting, last year what was happening is that bid/ask spread just got really big and the volume went down and just our cap rates moving to 10%. And today they are coming back in and it’s funny. Even though it seems spreads coming pretty dramatically in the bond markets, cap rates tend to like that, and I think cap rates tend to bunch up a bit more than you see credits cards. They have been a little bit flat so I'd have to characterize the business is kind of in the 8 to 9.5 range depending on quality today. And if you look at that, that the double B and single B, you have that 9% plus but that is moving down as there are some demand that returns to the market.
Greg Sweitzer – Citigroup: And last one. How comfortable are you pushing those C store industry exposure [ph]?
Tom Lewis:
 :
Greg Sweitzer – Citigroup: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: We do have a question from the line of Chris Lucas. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Good afternoon, guys.
Tom Lewis: Hi, Chris.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Just Tom, I want to follow on that one that comments if you just made about the compressing cap rates. It is a question that we used to get ready to, you know, kind of repeat itself here?
Tom Lewis: Good question. Well, I’d say, we are little more confident relative to volume and cap rates. I don’t think we are ready to say. We are back to a world that have spaces in it and those not going to be volatility yet, because that business is so heavily dependent on at least flat to lowering cap rates to make money, and there is generally a period of anywhere 3,6,9 months year the cycle of property. And I am going to have to get quite a bit more comfortable before we use Crest again or I am going to have to be in a situation where the cap rate that we are able to buyout really was wholesale and very high, and we think the market cap rate is substantially below, and that we can do something fairly quick. So I am not positive enough to bring Crest back into the equation again. And most of the transactions we have talked on -- again while there is more coming to market and cap rates are down, but it doesn’t look like it did in 2007 where you are going to have to buy a large portfolio and so part of it. So I would say for now we have no plans at all to lease [ph] Crest
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then just what’s the competitive landscape of that right now. I mean is this an environment, I mean, your cost to capital on the spread sound terrific. There is so much volume, right. So is that a function of the market competitive or there is no deal for right now, even the dynamics that you have right now?
Tom Lewis: It's really interesting because the volume has picked up, I am not sure quarter-to-quarter then reporting numbers on deal flow and what we look at, they tend to be very messy. I normally do them at the end of the year, because, yes, transactions you worked on a one quarter that they go away but they come back, and so that messes up the numbers quarter-to-quarter. But to give you an idea we worked on 16, 17 different transaction. There was about $475,000 million that we looked at and one of the things I was looking at before I got on the call, is we keep a peace for the ride of it, and it -- reason why we didn’t do the deal and it's kind of like credit issue, proceeds issue. Seller withdrew because he didn’t like rate, credit issue, proceeds issue, cap rate, real estate issue didn’t like the real estate. Two more seller withdrew because he didn’t like rates, couple of were more – they wanted more for the real estate than it was worth. And if you go through that's kind of what's going on for us. And then, as I mentioned earlier in accordance run rate of 20%, 30%, 40% in quarter isn't going to be that unusual and this is going to be a question one of these that matched up with proceeds cap rates underwriting, we liked it and you do a larger transaction. And that’s pretty much what it was in 2005, '06,'07, and during that period when I go back and look at it, there really only was 20, million, 30 million, 40 million a quarter and then all of sudden there were three or four big transactions of 50 to $250 million and that's how you got to the larger numbers.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then, just Paul, a quick question on the G&A, despite to the first quarter relative to fourth quarter, was there anything you need in the quarter? You didn't have – I don't think as new hires (inaudible) So, what was going on there?
Paul Meurer: Well, You have a – in a sense new hires do impact that number because you need to accrue for them on a monthly basis what you expect kind of comp to be at the end of the year. Although, it going to take that into account do you've people wants to January, February and March accrued comp, is impacted by that and that's a true expense. In addition, we are at higher stock price, so as these stock invested, you actually had an impact of higher expense basis, based on a higher stock price with the stock invested in January for lot of people.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Okay. Perfect. Great, thanks a lot guys.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Jeff Donnelly, please go ahead.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities: Tom, how do you think about the cushion between your AFFO and the cash dividend, it’s obviously narrow than the last two years. I think from, I think about like 20% of your AFFO down to about 5%. Is it your goal to restore that? That cushion or I guess, I am scared what do you think about it?
Tom Lewis: Sure. You know, kind of dividend history is, you know, Jeff before we will publicly paid out a 100% or kind of above, up and down and when we went public, we wanted to get the payout ratio down a bit until we had really diversified out the portfolio and nobody wanted to raise it. And we're probably comfortable around the 90% level of AFFO plus or minus were in around 93. Now, I think, but I would think if FFO picks up over the next two, three years, we'll continue to grow the dividend. But may be grow up at a little lower rate then the growth of FFO is what I would like to do. But I would wanted to think too far below 85%, and I think closer to 90 is long-term what we're comfortable about, we're in the business to pay dividends to people and that's really what we're all about and then secondarily the business tends to be pretty stable.
Paul Meurer: The other thing two is to look, and we've continued with small dividend raises. Let me kind a diagraph and kind a walkthrough what really went on you know the last few years. It’s interesting because while our FFO is going to be relatively flat. You know, kind of 2000 to 2010, we've raised the dividend but in smaller rates. And if you think and look at the earnings the last three years and you take Crest out and as you know, we never calculated the Crest and we’re looking with our payout ratio. So, the payout ratio look artificially lower than it was, because they're anywhere from 6 to $0.10 of share in Crest. So, we're really looking at the quarter earnings and trying to payout course to the 90. So, whatever that moment of payout ratio looks like compacts little less. And we close Crest down and then if you look at the last few years not doing much acquisitions for the last three. You're really down to our core FFO coming of the portfolio and we're very portioned in that most of the acquisitions that we really did 2002 to 2007. One other things we didn't talk a lot about that we're really centering in on as trying to build higher lease accelerators into those transactions that we did. And when we got to the 2007 and 2008, we've really started seeing both kick in. Now that's right into the recession and so the interesting thing was even though there was some rent erosion of the core portfolios, we doubled about fixed filings and couple of other tenants that need a rate reductions. That the revenue line and the FFO line state fairly flat but that was also a function of this over just starting to kick in. And so the modest dividend increases we're really were a function of wanting to continued increase a dividend and having stability but also seeing some of that erosion and that was probably in run rate about $0.09 in erosion that was made up for find this accelerators. And so as we can not look forward right now, my sense is if you don't get it double dip from here and watching our watch list which is spinning out. I would think that kind of that erosion would probably in towards the end of the year and when that happens I think you are going to see the run rate on things go rents go up. And when we see the run rate and things go, rents go up and we see that erosion stop that's when we're going to get a comfort level for the core earnings going up and really that would be the first time I think much more dividend increases above the four times kind of we done the last few years.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities: Very helpful. All right. Actually since you touched on a little bit, I think depending your outlook for the economy, I think last quarter you gave us a view, a forward view as the backdrop how you are going to manage the income, that was somewhere between I guess it called bad and neutral. Have you shifted it all, as you’ve seen some of these glimmers of strength returned to various segments of the economy?
Unidentified Company Representative: If I was standing looking over my left shoulder to bad and standing looking over my right shoulder the neutral maybe I have just adjusted myself to look a little more to neutral for now but I am skeptic.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. Is it that should imply that you look to maybe de-lever the company further or do you think its fine, the way it is?
Unidentified Company Representative: You know, frankly I think the leverage is fine the way it is. We are right around 29%, 30% leverage if you do it that way and that’s kind of what we targeted. The long-term policy and I think we put together in 1984 was we wanted to keep it below 35 and if we ran from 20 to 30 to 33 that was great. And given around 30 right now we’re just fine but if we could use equity for our growth in the future we don’t think that would hurt because with all of this money that's sloshed into the system you kind of making a bifurcated that, one is, is that okay, we grow slow, it's going to long time before rates go up and there is not much inflation in which case you’d say, yes, let's leave leverage where it is or even increase it. But the colliery of that is if you do get down the line and there is some traction in the economy, then maybe you’ll see some inflation in that case rates would go up and delivering modestly would be a very warm and comfortable position to be in at that time. So, I think a little biased for delivering but it's not major program.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities: And just last question was, I don’t want to leave Paul out of it, what’s going to be the, I guess, the annualized run-rate of increase in G&A not only if just the amount of people you just hired but I think you mentioned of that the some additional hire is beyond that. So, if you look at it I guess on a full year basis is we’re going in to 2011, and I guess the second part of that is, is there a level of acquisition volume that you need to see to justify the added cost?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, G&A for this year, well, first of all, let’s put it this way 2009 with about $21 million or 6.4% of total revenues which is a metric we always kind of glanced that. This year we expected to be about $26 million or about 7.5 % of total revenues. That assumes, you know, that the 100 to 250 million of acquisitions kind of a net level. But to extent the acquisitions could accelerate beyond that for some reasons G&A could be a little bit higher to the extent it’s on the $100 million level, then it would be a little bit lower but at 7.5% total revenues. I think that still put us in pretty good said [ph] and pretty good said [ph] historically in terms of not only where we’ve said as a the percentage of total revenues but where we’ve said we’re on a comp basis I think relative to somewhat appears in what you [ph].
Unidentified Company Representative: And I’ll just say that I think the acquisition guys, I wouldn’t say there’s a certain level of acquisitions to justify the guys that would say there’s a certain level of that, guys needed to get the acquisition.
Unidentified Company Representative: There are going to be a light effect. Right, I mean, that’s something Tom touched on was how we kind of bend down and enhanced [ph] little bit ‘07, ’08. You saw G&A go down a little bit ’09 as well, and now you’re going have a light effect here where we’re wrapping up G&A a little bit in advance that what we see as some opportunities on the acquisition side that we think we’ll justify those in large [ph].
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities: I don’t mean, to have kids [ph] you know has to be off on a tear that you know, jeopardizes the company but on the other hand, you know, if you are ramping a backup I am assuming a city more than and you know, $100 million a year?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, we most certainly know their right to, but you know, again I don’t want to get too far out in projecting the future because, if we just run back to a year ago you look at those credits spreads that I’ve talked about. You looked about what was going on. It was a very different world, so we all feel a lot better here 12 months later, but let’s also remember what we went through and be discipline in terms of how allocating capital on the buy side or issuing and if I am going to take a little risk I will do it on some personal and G&A and hopefully it will work out well.
Unidentified Company Representative: And we don’t have any more positions in research if that’s really what you getting at here Jeff.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo Securities: So, I want to be the Catty [ph] thanks. Thanks guys.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Rich Moore. Please go ahead.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Yeah. Hello, that is -- on the movie galleries that you talked about last quarter. I think you were thinking you are going to get back 12 out of the 24 and it look like you only had two more vacancies total this so I think that’s around 77. Is there anything happened with that?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yeah. We got couple back, but I really can’t comment on it because it’s we’re full swinging [ph] around the committee.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Okay. So is it --
Unidentified Company Representative: When we will, when we can --
Unidentified Company Representative: Let me just reiterate what we mentioned before. Rich it might be helpful. We used to have 34 locations we got 11 back in ’07. So, in theory those 11 were of lesser quality then the 23 that we cap the debt time. And that the experience of that 11 it’s been descent. We had seven of those released that 70% of prior rent so that might be a helpful metric as you look at what might happened to the remaining 23 that we have now.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. I got you; thanks and you can’t go any further now, I take it.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: And as far as, yes you did great. And as far as other bankruptcies you said watch list was kind of thinning out. Did you have any others this quarter and when we say thinning out I mean usually I think of the first quarter is kind of bankrupt this season. So sounds like that they are sending out a private and pretty good progress of the year.
Tom Lewis: I think we are sending out the issue and this is why I was talking earlier about, okay, if things are starting to thin out here, when does occupancy kind of bottom and when does same store rent the erosion come off it. And there’s a lag effect, so I really, I’ve gone down to portfolio management and sit down and said, “Okay, let’s take a look at everything out there, what’s your working on what we see coming”. And it end up with kind of an absent nothing else of major proportion. You probably look fourth quarter, first quarter next year to see things for rent increasing. But you know, there has been a slow down in things popping up on the watch list. You never --
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Nothing this quarter, Tom.
Tom Lewis: No, nothing this quarter
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, great. And then the lease expirations coming up, I mean, how do you feel about those? I guess a little bit more positive given the economy.
Tom Lewis: Yes, relative to lease roll over we've done, we were off to a good start for the year. I think we've done 26 in the first quarter and 25 went back to same tenants. And we actually saw some increases where it's been modest decreases in the last few years. It's a fairly small schedule. This year, I think there are 118 left, but that’s about 3% of revenue, but if you look at it, two-thirds of those are rolls that have rolled before. And typically when they go through rollover the first time, if there is something we could get it back and it hits you. The second rollovers are little better. So, our guess for the year right now is we got in the cash flow it's little bit of decline off there of a few 100 basis points but not a lot.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Good, thanks. And then I think you said the new properties you acquired the auto services and health and fitness, are any of those existing tenants?
Tom Lewis: Yes, LA Fitness, which is one of the reasons that you see that pop up a bit.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: You're right. Right, good point. And then, okay so just then, and then would there be more with either, either category, either those ---
Unidentified Company Representative: I hope so. But, you know, LA Fitness is our largest tenant. At some point we'll make a decision. Generally, 10% is our absolute maximum, but there are up at 6.1, so we want to watch that. They’ve been a very good company relative to performance, they've done extremely well and they – we've done good business with them, so we may do a little more, but at some point it need to moderate.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And the other services guide is not something sitting behind this initial purchase.
Unidentified Company Representative: No, no. Not that I’m aware of. He was new, we talked to him for sometime and we’re able to do a transaction and they are our clients, so he has to come up. We hope we get the call.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Got you. And then last thing, I think I had notes last quarter that Tire was one of the better same store rent increases and then this quarter it was one of the worst. Is that right?
Unidentified Company Representative: That is, and let me bifurcate that. We had one tenant that went through a chapter 11 last year. And I think we talked about him in the last call. Big 10 Tires and there were some rent reductions and this is the first quarter that they kind of hit the same store rent numbers. And last quarter we had increases from our other tire people, so part of that is timing.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, very good, got you. Thanks guys.
Unidentified Company Representative:
.:
Operator: And that dose complete today's question and answer session, I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Lewis for any concluding remarks.
Tom Lewis: Okay. Thank you very much everybody for taking the time and enjoy the rest of earning season. We look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.

===== 2009 Q4  (2010-02-11 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Tom Lewis – CEO and Vice Chairman Paul Meurer – EVP, CFO & Treasurer
Analysts: Michael Bilerman – Citigroup Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird
Operator: Welcome to the Realty Income fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. During today’s presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator instructions) This conference is being recorded today, Thursday, February 11, 2010. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.
Tom Lewis: You bet. Thank you, Douglas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In the room with me, as usual, is Gary Malino, our President; and Paul Meurer, our CFO; Mike Pfeiffer, General Counsel; and Terry Miller, who is Vice President, Corporate Communications. And as we always do, we’ll say that during this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law, and the Company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. And we’ll disclose in greater detail on the Company’s quarterly and on the Form 10-K, the factors that could cause such differences. And we’ll start with, Paul, going through the numbers. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Tom. As usual, I’m just going to comment on our financial statements with a few brief highlights of the results for the quarter. And starting with the income statement. Total revenue remained flat at around $82 million and that’s primarily because we now own 2339 properties as compared to 2348 properties a year ago. Furthermore, all of our acquisitions this past quarter are currently in the year, in December, so they didn’t have a major impact on the 2009 revenue. Same-store rental revenue increased 0.7% for the quarterly period. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $190,000 in the comparative quarterly period. Interest expense decreased for the quarter to $21.4 million. And of course, this reduction reflects the retirement of $120 million of our bonds over the past year. We had only $4.6 million of borrowings on our $355 million credit facility at year-end. And on a related note, our coverage ratios remain strong, with interest coverage at 3.5 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.7 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the fourth quarter were $5.1 million. For the year, G&A expenses were $20.9 million or lower than 2008 by almost $700,000, finishing the year at about 6.4% of total revenues. I also want to point out that our acquisition-related costs are now included in the G&A expense line. As per FAS 141R, we are now expensing rather than capitalizing these acquisition costs. In 2009, this totaled $62,000 for the 16 properties we acquired. Property expenses decreased by $214,000 to about $1.4 million for the quarter, as these expenses have continually decreased since the beginning of the year. And of course, these are the expenses primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance, and insurance, which we are responsible for on properties that are available for lease. Our current estimate for property expenses for 2010 is approximately $6 million or a run rate of about $1.5 million per quarter. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the Company. These taxes were actually negative $7,000 for the quarterly period, reflecting tax refunds from some states. Overall for the year, income taxes were $677,000 in 2009 as compared to $1.2 million in 2008, again reflecting tax refunds we’re receiving from various states. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter, totaled $4,293,000. Real estate acquired for resale, of course, refers to the operations of Crest Net Lease, our subsidiary that acquires and resells properties. Crest did not acquire any new properties, but Crest did sell two properties in the quarter and overall, Crest contributed income or FFO of $649,000 in the quarter. Real estate held for investment refers to property sales by Realty Income from our existing core portfolio. We did sell eight properties during the quarter, resulting overall in income of approximately $3.6 million. And these property sales gains are not included in our funds from operations. Preferred stock cash dividends remained at $6.1 million for the quarter and net income available to common stockholders was $29.3 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO, was approximately $48.4 million for the quarter and $190.4 million for the year. FFO per share was $0.47 per share for the quarter, an increase of 2.2% in the comparative quarterly period. And FFO per share for the year came in a $1.84 versus $1.83 in 2008, an increase of 0.5%. When we file our 10-K, we’ll again provide you information you need to compute our adjusted funds from operations or AFFO, or the actual cash that we have available for distribution as dividends. Our AFFO or the actual cash we generate, which is available to pay out as dividend is, as usual, higher this quarter than our FFO. And this is typical, because our capital expenditures are very low and we have very minimal straight line rent in our portfolio. We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter. We have increased the dividend 49 consecutive quarters and 56 times overall since we went public over 15 years ago. Our dividend payout ratio for the quarter was only 91% of our funds from operations and as I’ve mentioned, lower on an AFFO basis. Now let’s turn to the balance sheet briefly. We’ve continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. Our debt-to-total market capitalization today is 29% and our preferred stock outstanding represents just 7.5% of our capital structure. And all of these liabilities are fixed rate obligations. We only had $4.6 million of borrowings on our $355 million credit facility. This facility also has a $100 million accordion expansion feature. The initial term of this facility runs until May 2011, plus two one-year extension options thereafter. We have $10 million of cash on-hand and as you know; our next debt maturity is until 2013. In summary, we currently have excellent liquidity and our overall balance sheet remains healthy and safe. And let me turn the call back over to Tom, who will give you a few more background pieces of information on these results.
Tom Lewis: Thanks, Paul. And as usual, I’ll run through kind of the key areas of operations for the Company. And let me start with the portfolio. The portfolio continued to do really quite well in the fourth quarter, given the state of retail. And I think, generally, our tenants have continued to see their business stabilize a bit in recent quarters. And I’d say over the last couple of months or so, generally, their mood has improved. And that means either they’re getting used to the economy slower or things are indeed getting a bit better in their businesses overall. During the fourth quarter, all 118 retail chains in the portfolio paid full rent and we had no tenants in reorganization. And at the end of the quarter, if you take a look at our top 15 tenants, which comprised about 53% of our revenue, generally, the cash flow coverage at the store level or the EBITDA they have compared to the rent they pay, generally was about 2.5 times the rent they paid. So, we have a little improvement there and they continue to be well covered rents in the key tenants. And obviously, owning the more profitable stores, as we are used to talking about is what has kept I think the portfolio occupancy high. Ended the third quarter at 96.8% occupancy. That’s 75 properties available for lease and 2339 in the portfolio. That’s the same percentage at the end of the third quarter and just about 20 basis points from where we were the same period a year ago. So, given the state of retail in the last year and a lot of activity in the portfolio, we’re pleased with that result. Same-store rents on the portfolio increased 0.7% during the quarter, 0.4% for the year, so up a bit. Our sense right now looking forward is that same-store rent growth should be positive in the coming quarters. And we anticipate that, again, for the year. I think it will be modest, but I think there will be good same-store rent increases during this year. And I find this interesting to do and I’ll share with you kind of where we saw the increases, decreases and flat in terms of same-store rent. Of the 30 different retail industries in the portfolio, six had declining same-store rents during the year. Restaurants were about half of that. The balance mostly came from motor vehicle dealerships, sporting goods, consumer electronics and bookstores. And I think that’s just about what you would expect coming out of those segments of retail today. And the declines in the seven industries were about $2.7 million in rent for the year. Two of our industries had flat same-store rent, which was apparel and office supplies. And then there were 22 industries that saw same-store rents increase, with the biggest increases really coming out of convenient stores, which were some good increases over the years. And then pretty good increases also out of our tire stores, child care, health and fitness and home improvement. The 21 industries together had a total increase in same-store rent of about $4 million. And if you net that out against the declines, that’s a net gain of about $1.3 million. That’s for the year. For the quarter, the percentage increase was a little higher. And we actually had an increase on some of our restaurant properties, which was a bit surprising. But interesting to see where it came from. And along with same-store rent, if you looked in net-net with about a 20 basis point decline in occupancy for the year and the same-store rent increases that netted us a small increase for 2009 you see in the rental revenue in the income statement. I think we continue to be pretty well-diversified. As I mentioned, 2339 properties at the end of the quarter, that’s up five net from last quarter, still 30 industry, still 118 tenants in 49 states. By industry, our largest exposure continues to be to the restaurant industry, with about 21.3% of revenue. That’s down a bit from a year ago and we will continue to work that down and maybe a little faster now, as we see acquisitions over the course of the year. Convenience stores are 17%. That’s up a bit, but really due to kind of across the board rent increases coming out of our C stores. Theaters at 9.3%, doing pretty well and childcare now down to about 6.7%. As you can see in the press release, the largest tenant is about 6% of rent. The next one is 5.3%, it goes down to there. And when you get really to our 16th largest tenant, you drop below 2% of revenue in the portfolio. So, it remains fairly well-diversified. Also, I think with good lease length was about 11.2 years remaining lease on average in the portfolio. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we did have one of our tenants that went into reorganization here in the first quarter. That was Movie Gallery or Hollywood Video. They filed an 11 last week. And I think since they also filed in 2007, that be a Chapter 22 then. The properties that we have with them have been in the portfolio for about 11 years or 12 years. I think for the last four years, we’ve been trying to reduce the exposure to that industry. And today, Movie Gallery represents less than 1% of revenue going into this on the 23 properties that we have with them. Our sense is looking at them and their business model that we’re probably going to get back about 12 properties of those and we plan on releasing those units. We actually have released a number of Hollywood’s to other tenants over the last couple of years. And these were some weaker locations that we got back in 2007 reorganization that they went through. And so we’ve got some good comps to go by, because all of those leases were signed in 2008 and 2009. So it’s helpful to take a look at those. Generally, there are about 7,000 square-foot boxes on about an acre of land. We’ve leased them to the auto parts retailers, some consumer electronics, pet supplies, furniture rental and then some local tenants. And a lot of them are out pads to grocery anchored centers, and so they’re pretty good to lease yet in this environment, it’s interesting. If you take the seven that we leased last year and the year before, generally, we retained about 70% of pre-filing rent on those units. So, if you want to do a back of the hand, if the revenue is under 1% and we get about half of them back and we get about 70% of that, the impact overall to the revenue stream this year should be fairly small. The other thing is, is that we have accounted for that in our guidance and it’s included in that. So, I don’t think there’s a major impact. The other thing on this, as has been extremely useful to us when these events happen, which is a normal course of business item. We are on the Creditors Committee for this reorganization. So we’re actively involved with the discussion and pretty well-informed in terms of what’s going on. Obviously, as always, that requires a confidentiality agreement with the Court so that will be kind of my comments on Movie Gallery for now. And as that progresses over the next six months to 12 months and as is appropriate, then we’ll walk through the impact, which again, is I don’t think, substantial. All of the rest of the 117 tenants today are current with their rent and paying on time. And we anticipate that the rent they are paying should modestly increase the balance of 2010, as it did in 2009. Anyway, relative to the portfolio, to sum things up, positive same-store rent, good occupancy, and I think pretty good performance from what we’re hearing from the tenants. Moving on to property acquisitions, as most of you know, at the end of the third quarter, we began starting to acquire properties again. And I’ll tell you the volumes of transactions we evaluated in Committee upticked pretty substantially in the end of the third quarter in September and then on into October and November. And that really resulted in the fourth quarter with some good opportunities. And as you see, we bought 13 properties for $46 million. The acquisitions were with two tenants. One was an existing tenant, one, a new tenant to us that we’ve been trying to get their business for years. One, in the convenience store business, one in health and fitness. They were bought subject to long-term triple net leases; average lease length is about 18 years. And cash on cash yields or cap rates starting out were 9.6% of the assets that we bought in the quarter. So pretty good spreads and yields off those. For the year, that gave us just under $58 million of acquisitions on 16 properties, and again, about 9.7% caps. It’s been the tradition every year on this call to do the fourth quarter, to talk about during the year what we worked on in Investment Committee and then what we ended up buying to give everybody a feeling for transaction flow. And I’ll just do those numbers if you want to take notes on these. During 2009, which was in the third quarter and fourth quarter, we worked on 56 separate transactions in Committee. It involved 698 properties, had an estimated value of about $1.5 billion. And the average cost of the property then we were looking at was about $2.1 million. And the cap rates that we were discussing on these generally were in the high-9s. And again, it’s 56 transactions, 698 properties, about $1.5 billion, $2.1 million average unit cost and cap rates in the high 9s. Out of that, we participated and did four transactions with 16 properties and that was the $58 million. And the average cost of the property was $3.6 million, average cap rate 9.7%. And if you run the math that works out to, we bought about 4% of what went through the Committee in the third quarter and fourth quarter If you look back over the last 10 years or so, I think the average is to do about 13% of what gets into the underwriting process. Four is low and that may be skewed a little bit because of starting late in the year. But I think was also reflective of the quality of some of the transactions that we had to evaluate, particularly, as we were looking in the third quarter. And you saw some people coming to market with transactions, where I’m not sure that the transaction was going to fix their overall problem or the proceeds they were looking for was high. So I think that’s the reason that was a little lower hit rate. And I think as we look now, we continue to look at transactions here pretty actively in the first quarter and I think it’s likely we’ll be buying properties in the first quarter. And what’s going on is, recently, the flow of larger transactions has picked up quite a bit over the last 90 days or so. And the other thing I’ll notice is lately, the quality of kind of what’s coming through the door is better, so, my sense is the hit rate will increase a little bit as we go on here. I wouldn’t want to describe it as a deluge of transactions that come to market, we definitely do see the volume increasing that is coming across we can look at. So we’re looking at opportunities and cautiously optimistic that we’re going to be able to add some very nice property acquisitions to the portfolio this year. And with the progress in the fourth quarter, it’s nice to be working on revenue growing again and adding to the top-line. I think it served us well to be out of the acquisition business for a while, but I think that we will be able to make some progress this year. Cap rates in the marketplace on the things that we’ve been looking at, I think have generally come in a bit over the last 90 days or so. The retail one-off cap rate for the type of properties we’ve been buying is probably around 8%, though with low volumes in the one-off market today, every transaction is a little different. So, we’re trying to figure out where the one-off market is. I think some of the rates that you see trading are a bit anecdotal and you’ve got to add out a bunch of them. I think the wholesale transactions are larger ones like we do directly with owners and retailers. I think you’re looking in the mid-to-high 9s range and coming in a little bit, as I said over the last 90 days or so. Looking at the type of transactions, to some degree what I said last quarter, which is there is not too much of a theme relative to industries that we’re seeing the opportunities coming in. A lot of it seems to be balance sheet-generated, where a few of the sellers are now saying, okay, I’ve got some upcoming obligations and I’m going to need to act on those and let’s see what I can do from a sale leaseback standpoint. The one difference though is we are starting to see some M&A transactions where the real estate can be used to finance the purchase. As you know, there was a lot of add-in '05, '06 and '07 and I’ve been a little surprised to start seeing not huge ones, but some smaller M&A type transactions coming in over the trends. So, I think maybe there’s a little more of that going on. The other thing to be said in the net lease market today, there are just a lot of properties that have been developed in the last couple of years, where the developers have not been able to sell the assets. And so there is a lot of that inventory out there to be bought. I don’t think it fits us. As you know, generally, we want to buy existing units with stabilized cash flows, so we can calculate the cash flow coverages. And it’s been our sense that we have better long-term results relative to occupancy, if we do that. But there are a lot of developers that have built properties and are now looking to sell them. And then, secondarily, I think a lot of them are trying to figure out if there is going to be some new development in retail, which we’re starting to see pick-up a little bit, trying to figure out how they’re going to finance that, and that’s a big question mark out there. Not an opportunity for us, but it’s something we’ve been noticing in the market. There’s some, I think, good traction here in the fourth quarter in acquisitions and I think it will be fun to see how this turns out over the course of the year. But, so far, the acquisition activity has been picking up. Moving on to dividends, obviously, cash dividends are the priority. We’d anticipate dividends this year will be higher than last year and it is our goal to have them higher in 2011 than where they are in 2010. And I think that while some modest progress will be made in portfolio operations in generating revenue on the top-line, I think most of the growth in this year would come from acquisitions. And that would be helpful relative to FFO and dividends. Paul commented on the balance sheet. We continue to be in a very liquid position with a little bit of cash on hand and vast majority of the line available. No debt due. Obviously, no mortgage debt. And really, not a lot going on where we’ve committed to developments or other things, which is our custom. So, access to capital is good out there and I think that’s true of equity preferred or debt. And should we be able to meaningfully add to the acquisitions this year, the capital markets for now look like they are available to us. As to FFO for 2009 and then looking at guidance, it came in pretty much as we expected, with some modest FFO growth. And as Paul said, while we did the $58 million in acquisitions, very little of it was done except at the end of the year, so it didn’t add meaningfully to FFO. And it’s probably the last time I’ll be able to do this, but it’s interesting to note that. If you look at 2009, we didn’t buy a lot of property except at the end of the year. We sold a few properties. Crest was essentially shut down for the entire year. While operating expenses declined, it literally wasn’t a program; it’s reflective of less activity in acquisitions. And so what we’ve really been looking at in the portfolio is the core operations pretty deep into a tough recession and we were able to get through with some modest growth in rental income and FFO. Very pleased with the way it held up to-date. I’m not in the camp that the economy is suddenly going to get radically better, so I think there’s a lot of work to be done in portfolio management over the course of the year as there was last year, but, I think maybe modestly better. Guidance for 2010 remains unchanged at 1.1% to about 4.3% FFO growth. That assumes relative stability in the portfolio. It also includes the impact that we see from Movie Gallery or Hollywood Video and $50 million to $250 million of acquisitions is the number that we’re using right now with little or no contribution really from Crest. And we do not have any plans to start acquiring in Crest and open that business back up. To summarize then, a pretty good quarter. And we look forward to making some headway on the revenue side as we start buying again. And with that, Douglas, if we could open up to questions? I think it’d be a good time to do that.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Greg Sweitzer with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Hi. I’m Michael Bilerman is on as well. Tom, you mentioned cap rates have come in a bit. How sticky do you think that the mid-9s average rate that you saw for the bigger deals will be as year progresses?
Tom Lewis: It’s hard to tell. I should have really said they came in a bit and I think they continue to come in a bit. So the discussions we’re having now are most definitely in the 9s, but we do see them coming in. And it wouldn’t surprise me even without any stronger recovery in the economy, if interest rates stay low, then you probably see them in the low 9s for the year so they could come in a bit more. But we’re still thinking in the 9% to 10% range and for now, using 9.5% as kind of our planning.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Okay. And then outside of the C stores and the gyms that you acquired, what types of other industries showed up in the deals that you looked at in the quarter and expect to see through this year? Is there any trend or is the pretty spread out?
Tom Lewis: It was pretty spread out. There were some theater transactions that we worked on, a couple of those that came through the door. There was a fair amount of C store. There was health and fitness. There were a lot of restaurant properties that we just don’t even include the numbers we looked at, because we’re not doing that right now. So, it’s interesting. As long as I’ve been in this business, there were always a lot of restaurants, that’s true. In the last ten years, it’s become more a lot of volume C store, that’s true. Movie theaters, I think were the theme for the quarter. And then the other theme was people are showing us a lot of newly developed properties, which we’re just not spending any time on. But other than that, no real industry theme that I can think of.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Okay, great. And then just one more. Any new insight or changes that you’ve seen that you could share from a tenant or industry standpoint? Any tenants that you perhaps have more comfort over or any new ones you’ve started to watch?
Tom Lewis: Yes, the list relative to industries remains the same. The top of it is, obviously, the RV business because it’s a big ticket, consumer durable, needs to be financed. And that was an industry that just really got hit the last two years. It’s unusual for us to have this type of industry in the portfolio. And I’m just pleased the tenant held up through this. There is some good news. But if you look at what happened to the RV business, I was looking up the numbers earlier and trying to get the forecast for this year. And in 2008, I think there were about 239,000 RV shipped in the U.S. That was down 33% from 2007. And 2009 it looks like it’s going to be about 159,000 that were shipped, which is down another 33%. But interestingly, the fourth quarter, the run rate was back up over 200,000. And they’re projecting that it will be over 200,000 in 2010, so there’s some very strong movement in the fourth quarter. The other thing I saw is a good example is that Thor Industries, which is one of the major manufacturers, was talking about in their most recent quarter that shipments, RVs out of their stores were up about 148% for the year over period. So, there’s been some help come out of the government on that end of the industry, with some tax advantages for buying a new RV. And that industry did have a turnaround in the fourth quarter and we noticed the cash flow coverages that we have there moved up pretty dramatically in the fourth quarter. Now they’ve gone down pretty dramatically, but there was some comfort there. The second area really is in restaurants. That’s still a very tough business. Casual dining, as we all know has gotten hit. And I don’t think it’s rebounded substantially, but I think the bleeding has slowed a little bit. The high-end restaurants, obviously it’s not good, but we don’t have a lot in that. The one that was interesting in the fourth quarter is if you look at the fast food restaurant side, that it really benefited from people trading down and had great same-store sales over the last couple of years. They got hit in the fourth quarter. So, restaurant continues to be an area that’s tough. But I think generally, the tenants we have there have hung in there and the cash flow coverages we have are decent, but it bears us continuing to watch. The other industry that’s been surprising this time around is the child day care. Traditionally, that has been held up extremely good in recession. We’ve been in that business for well over 25 years. And we’ve been through recessions and some deep downturns on a regional basis and it’s really held up. I think what’s going on there this time around is in the last 10 years, 15 years, the amount of revenue that comes into those organizations from government programs paying for child care has grown. And as municipal and state budgets get squeezed, I think there’s been a little squeezing on their side of the business. So that’s been tougher this time. And I’m glad we have some older units with low rents that continue to have pretty good coverages. But that’s the watched list. The RV was the one that we really were watching very carefully and really nice to see the fourth quarter intact. And then restaurant and child care continue to be tough areas, but stabilized a little.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Okay, thank you. Look forward to seeing you guys few weeks in Florida.
Tom Lewis: You bet.

Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: Good afternoon, guys, it’s nice of you to make it in with a lot of snow hitting the coast. So, actually, Tom, I guess I’ll start with you. You mentioned in your comments that you’re not expecting a radically better economy. So this is an easy question to start off. I guess, what is your view the economy and interest rates, as you look forward two years or three years? And what implications does that hold for your decision to maybe recycle capital a bit more aggressively through sales and acquisitions and then and even your leverage policy?
Tom Lewis: Sure. It’s funny, we run scenario planning on the economy and read everything everybody publishes. And if you go back two years, three years ago, our scenario for things getting very rough, we felt very strongly about, took a lot of action on it and it served us well. And as we sit around and talk today, you sit and go, okay, what can happen? The whole economy can come back. The great moderation will continue and things are going to be just peachy, but we don’t have much of a weighting at all on that one. You can say, okay, moderate growth over time and we come back and okay, we’ll weigh that a third and then you get kind of the things don’t pick-up, but don’t get meaningful worse, a la Japan, the last decade give that a third. And then we double dip and it doesn’t get great and we give that a third. So it’s a long-winded way of saying. We don’t have a lot of conviction of thinking we know right now. And the thoughts on acquisitions is that cap rates have moved up. The spreads over cost of capital are good. And there’s opportunity because there’s fewer people out there with capital than there has been in the past. And we would stop acquiring on a dime if at some point the spreads weren’t there or we didn’t like the quality of it. But our sense is, is that we can add to revenue now on assets that we’re going to want to hold a long time with substantial cash flow coverages and it’s a good time to go do that. So that really laid it out there. And then in terms of the capital that we would use, lately, as you’ve witnessed in the REIT industry, obviously, debt has been extremely attractively priced. It’s moderated a little bit, but still well-priced. The preferred markets come back and debt on our balance sheet is only about 29%. Preferreds down in the mid-single digit, so both of those could be added to the balance sheet comfortably. And then as you know there’s been a prejudice for equity and the equity has traded pretty well. Given we don’t have a really strong conviction of a snap back; I don’t think I’d want to add dramatic leverage to the portfolio. We’re laddered out pretty good with our debt now and I wouldn’t want to do anything short-term, but we haven’t made really a decision, but we think as long as capital is available at good prices, we’ll keep acquiring and we’ll try and keep leverage low.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: Do you think this increases your desire to maybe sell assets and use that as a source of proceeds?
Tom Lewis: That something we’ve been talking about and it looks really good. And as you model it out though it cuts into FFO, a fair amount. But I think if we were able to achieve FFO growth up above the 2%, 3%, 4% range over the next year or so because of acquisitions or the portfolio does well, we might take the opportunity to bring that back down a little bit and use it as an opportunity to sell some assets and move into some things where either like the cash flow coverages better or we like the industry better. And then also where we think that in our lease structures that we can get a little more inflation protection, because that’s one of the risks out in the future, given money supply growth if the economy does snap back.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: And you sounded a little more, I’ll say, optimistic on the acquisition front. What are the odds that you maybe meet your 2010 acquisition goal in the first half of the year?
Tom Lewis: I don’t think I’ll go there with you, but I think there’s a greater chance of it substantially than I felt 90 days ago, just by the number of transactions coming over and that some of them have some pretty good quality. I don’t know about the first six months, it’s going to ebb and flow. You’ll be sitting here for a month and you’ll have some things to work on and then five things come in the door, and you think, man here comes the deluge. And then three weeks will go by, you don’t see another. So I don’t know how it’s going to come. In our modeling, we’re keeping it at the end of each quarter and pretty equally distributed among the four quarters. And I’ll have a better feel as we go. But it’s hard to say, but I do feel much better than I did 90 days ago about the volume.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: And just a quick question or two for Paul. It might not be a meaningful enough change to really make a material difference, but since you do have a lot of assets in your portfolio that are probably a fairly low book value, to the extent, you guys do begin to recycle your asset base a little bit more and you’re effectively buying at today’s prices and you’re selling assets that have a low book value. Does that benefit your credit metrics from the standpoint of lenders I think they look at you guys, because your sort of book based leverage metrics would obviously be improving? Is that encouraging to them? Or is that really not a significant focus right now?
Paul Meurer: I think if you do the technical math on that, you could make an argument that there might be a slight benefit as it relates to some of those ratios that as you know, were built into some of the agreements. But the reality is I don’t think we can’t foresee a scenario where we would uptick that sort of activity to a point where it would make a material difference. If you look back to 2002, just to give you a couple of statistics, we’ve sold anywhere from 10 properties to 43 properties a year, ranging from $7 million a year to $35 million a year. As the 10-K comes out, you’ll see we make a prediction in there of a general range of $10 million to $35 million of sales for 2010. That’s really our best guess. Even for on the high end of that or even if we enter a strategy where we agree with you and say, gee, let’s recycle some more capital, you’re not talking about that much where it would have that much of a material impact on what you’re describing. So if you’re talking about $35 million, let’s say, plus of sales, it really wouldn’t affect it that much.
Tom Lewis: The other thing, Jeff, is, is one of the nuances of the net lease small property businesses, when we buy properties, we tend to buy them in bulk in transactions. But when you sell them, you tend to sell them one-by-one. So the operational difficulty of a large number of sales in the portfolio is, A) expensive, and B) takes a lot of manpower to execute. So it is a little different than some other industries. And that’s why it does. I think hit the FFO a little harder just to go through those transactions.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: Just wanted to be sure you weren’t thinking about something more dramatic. Just last question, really more of a nitpicky one, but I think your occupancy has traditionally been calculated on a, I guess call it a percentage of properties vacant basis. But I don’t expect it would, but would it vary much if you looked at it on either a square footage or even a percentage of, I guess I’ll call it revenue potential?
Tom Lewis: I look at that about once a year just to make sure it’s not getting too far away. And it’s amazing to me how close it stays, where if you looked at it on a revenue basis or whether you looked at it on a number of properties or square footage. It can vary a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but it’s been unusual if it’s been more than 10 bps or 20 bps away, no matter how you calculate it.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wells Fargo: Okay, thanks, guys.

Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Good afternoon, guys.
Tom Lewis: Hey, Chris.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Just a quick technical question. What’s the inventory for Crest at this point?
Tom Lewis: It’s a grand total of three properties with a cost of –
Paul Meurer: $3.8 million in book value. And those are three Ryan Steakhouses properties.
Tom Lewis: Yes, that we have all impaired down to that value also. We did that a little over a year ago. That’s down from about $138 million of inventory two years ago.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Very good. And then, Tom, you were talking about the cap rates coming down a little bit here. That sounds to me like it’s getting more competitive. Is that the case? And if you could maybe give some color as to maybe who your competitors are right now in the marketplace.
Tom Lewis: Yes, there aren’t a lot of competitors. There’s really just a couple that you see out there anymore. And obviously one is another public REIT. And then there’s a private REIT. And then as always, there’s a couple of other guys that show up that you don’t know really who they are and they buy something occasionally. But I think it’s more reflective of financing costs have come in generally for our tenants. So, if you look at the spreads on less investment grade bonds, they’ve really tightened. And that means that the debt side of the balance sheet for them is attractive. And they’re looking at relative financing costs. So I think more than competition, which there’s very little of right now, compared to a few years ago, it’s really financing costs coming in. And when you see them come in, you can assume that there’ll be some lagging cap rate movement in. And when you see them gap out, then there’s probably some lagging cap rate moving up in the net lease business, maybe a little more than some of the other real estate categories.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: I guess just kind of thinking about, maybe I’m not sure you really answered Jeff’s question on your expectations for interest rate. Does it give you pause, given where rates are and the tremendous compression we’ve seen in corporate bond rates? And just generally across the board, in terms of how you’re proceeding at this point, given maybe your outlook for the out years on rates?
Tom Lewis: Yes, it does give me pause and I’m surprised how quickly spreads came back in. And that’s pretty much not just on real estate but for all companies. And I think people got excited here. I’m very surprised they came in as much as they did and I think the potential to have them gap out is there. And so, one of the things I think you really want to do is be careful. We’re fortunate right now with cash on hand and the lines unused, so essentially what we bought was bought with cash on hand. But I don’t think I would let large substantial amounts of money build up on short-term credit lines as a very good strategy. I think you want to very quickly put the permanent capital onto the permanent cap rate in this environment. Everybody watches and they’re starting to talk about how they do it when they do it. But at some point, absent a double dip, it wouldn’t surprise me to see rates go up. So we’re going to want to finance fairly quickly if we start seeing some bulk transactions come through that we want to act on. I think it would be risky in this environment to hold a lot on the line. It’s short-term very accretive, but it’s financing a long-term asset with short-term variable rate financing.
Paul Meurer: And what’s interesting, Chris, about this is that while our cost of capital could increase a little bit, we do feel like there’s plenty of room there to maintain a pretty healthy spread relative to lease yields and what we’re doing. To the extent that high yield debt spreads gapped out a bit, that would be wonderful. So, while the investment grade bond market, which we all follow on the REIT sector, spreads have come in significantly. To some extent, it’s been almost more surprising to watch high yield debt spreads contract so much. And that, if you will, is one of our competitors out there. So, beyond just the other equity net lease providers, it’s really the high yield debt product and the type of retailer that we’re doing business with considering that financing product. And so, in a rising interest rate environment, while our current cost of capital on our balance sheet for the debt piece of what we do may go up a bit, I actually think that on the acquisition side, we could actually benefit a little bit to the extent the high yield debt becomes a little bit more expensive out there.
Tom Lewis: A widening credit spread is very good for us.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Very good. And then my last question, I’m trying to understand, Kerasotes is one of your larger tenants. They sold, I guess, a large portfolio to AMC. How does that impact, if at all, your view to their credit at this point?
Tom Lewis: It is a positive. They are now, as part of AMC, AMC already is the second largest theater company in the United States. And so we will have a larger, more varied tenant less Midwest geographic exposure. And I believe S&P put Kerasotes debt on a credit watch positive. So that’s how we view it as a positive. We know AMC, we haven’t done business with them before, but we’ve talked to them over the years and they’re a good operator. So, we view it as a net small positive.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Okay, thanks a lot, guys.
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. I will now turn the call over to management for concluding remarks.
Tom Lewis: Thank you very much, everybody. A good quarter. I’ll tell you though here in the first quarter, I want everybody to know, there’s been a lot of work to do in portfolio management and leasing. And this is in an environment we’re all going to watch where the economy goes. But it’s nice to be acquiring again. That makes things a little easier than just relying on the portfolio as it sits there. And so we hope the spreads hold up. Thank you very much for your time.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Realty Income's third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.
Tom Lewis: Thank you very much, Jeremy. Good afternoon, everybody and welcome to the conference call. And as was said, we'll try and run through the third quarter results. And with me in the room today is Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Pfeiffer, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and as always, Tere Miller, our Vice President, Corporate Communications. And as I’m obligated to do, I will say that during this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements and we will disclose in greater deal on the company's quarterly and Form 10-Q the factors that may cause such differences. And we’ll have Paul start out and begin with the overview of the numbers. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Tom. As usual, let me comment on the financial statements; just provide a few highlights of our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Total revenue remained flat at around $82 million and this is primarily because we’ve sold 24 properties over the past year and have acquired only three additional new properties. We owned 2,355 properties at September 30th of last year while we own only 2,334 properties today. Same-store rental revenue increased 0.4% for the quarterly and year-to-date periods. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $176,000 from the comparative quarterly period. Interest expense decreased for the quarter to $21.4 million. This reduction reflects of course the retirement of $120 million of our bonds over the past year. We continue to have zero borrowings on our credit facility. And on a related note, our coverage ratios remain strong with interest coverage at 3.5 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.7 times. General and administrative or G&A expenses in the third quarter decreased by $191,000 and we continue to expect G&A expenses in 2009 to remain flat or lower as compared to 2008 at only about 6.5% of total revenue. Property expenses decreased by $102,000 to about $1.6 million for the quarter as these expenses have continually decreased each quarter since the beginning of the year. These expenses are primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance, and insurance expenses, which we are responsible for properties available for lease. Our current estimate for property expenses for all of 2009 is about $7.4 million and our estimate for 2010 however is significantly lower at approximately $6 million or back really to 2008 levels. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company. These taxes totaled $74,000 for the quarterly period. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $2.1 million. Real estate acquired for resale, refers to the operations of Crest Net Lease, our subsidiary that acquires and resells properties. However, Crest did not acquire or sell any properties in the quarter. Overall, Crest contributed to income or FFO of $207,000 in the quarter. Real estate held for investment refers to property sales by Realty Income from our existing core portfolio. We sold seven properties during the third quarter, resulting overall in income of approximately $1.9 million. However, these property sales gains are not included in our funds from operations. Preferred stock cash dividends remained at $6.1 million for the quarter. Net income available to common stockholders was $27.1 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO was approximately $48.2 million for the quarter. FFO per share was $0.47, an increase of 2.2% in the comparative quarterly period. When we file our 10-Q, we will again provide information you need to compute our adjusted funds from operations or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends. Our AFFO, or the actual cash available we generate, which is available to pay out as dividend, as usual, is higher this quarter than our FFO. This is typical because as I’ve always said, our capital expenditures are very low and we have very minimal straight line rent in our portfolio. We increased our cash monthly dividend again this quarter. We have increased the dividend 48 consecutive quarters and 55 times overall since we went public 15 years ago. Our dividend payout ratio for the quarter was 90.9% of our FFO and even lower on an AFFO basis. And now, let's turn to the balance sheet briefly. We have continued to maintain a very conservative and safe capital structure. Our debt-to-total market capitalization today is about 30% and our preferred stock outstanding represents just 8% of our capital structure. And of course, all of these liabilities are fixed rate obligations. We continue to have zero borrowings on our $355 million credit facility. And this facility also has a $100 million accordion expansion feature. The initial term runs until May 2011, plus two one-year expansion options thereafter. We had $20 million of cash on hand at the end of the quarter and our next debt maturity isn't until 2013. In summary, we currently have excellent liquidity, and our overall balance sheet remains healthy and safe. We have no exposure to variable rate debt and we have no need to raise capital for any balance sheet maturities for almost four years. Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom, who will give you a little bit more background on these results.
Tom Lewis: Thanks, Paul. Why don’t I start with the portfolio and just generally say that the portfolio is doing very well given the state of retail today. I think our tenants have generally seen their business stabilize over the last couple of quarters and so far here in the fourth quarter that remains the case and we talk to them, there seems to be a bit more positive tone about where they are today and I think for them, it’s really the comment of the new normal and flats to new up and since they haven't seen declines and they’ve had a little more positive vent in their business, they seem to be a lot more positive. But I don't want to get carried away relative to what they are saying. I think they are just more relieved than anything else. We worked with a few of them over the last 18 months or so to get through issues that have hit some of them during the recession. Fortunately, we missed most of the failures that have occurred out there in retail and in the cases where we had properties with retailers that did have problems, we generally have owned them more profitable properties, which means that we were impacted much less than others might have been or some might have expected. And I’m also really happy to say that as we sit here in the fourth quarter, none of that is going on in the portfolio as of right now. All the tenants today are current with their rent; we have no discussions going on at all with any of the tenants about problems paying their rent or a desire for rent reductions. There is nobody in Chapter 11 that we are talking to about problems with their properties and it is unusually quiet in the portfolio and clearly a more positive environment relative to their operations and what’s going on in their business as it impacts us for maybe over the last 18 months, which has been very nice to see. We often talk about owning the more profitable properties in our portfolio and that really focuses around looking down at the store-level cash flows and having a good idea of how profitable our properties are to the retailers, which is really the key as to how we perform in the long term, and our largest 15 tenants use those as an example as we frequently do to about 52.9% of our revenues. And at the end of the third quarter, the average cash flow covered in those 15 largest tenants was just under 2.5 times or about $2.50 in cash flow that they produced off the stores on average that we own with them for every dollar they pay in rent and I think really that those coverage is why the portfolio has done pretty well over the last 18 months are so and really, over the long term for the company. We ended the third quarter with 96.8% occupancy in 75 properties available for lease. That’s out of 2,334 properties. It’s up about 20 basis points from last quarter to 96.8% and just around where we were pretty much in the portfolio a year ago, which I think is positive. Our same-store rents continue to increase, up about 0.4% and that includes the reductions that we did a year ago with Buffets as they went through their Chapter 11. Absent that, it would have been a little higher. Our census right now looking into our crystal ball for the fourth quarter that we should see same-store rent growth being positive in that quarter and for the coming quarters, albeit at a modest rate, really as we have seen over the last year and I think you’d expect in this type of environment. To give you an idea where same-store increases came from, of the 30 retail industries we have in the portfolio, seven had declining same-store rents. Restaurants were most of it, primarily coming from the Buffet’s renegotiation. Two of the industries had flat same-store rents and then 21 of the industries in the portfolio had rent increases with the majority coming from convenience stores, tire stores, child care, and then health and fitness were the largest contributors. And I think the general theme we see in our portfolio and we continue to hear from the retailers is that kind of basic goods and services that people buy on a regular basis at low price points seem to be certainly outperforming the results over those people that have more discretionary and durable goods type businesses and that seems to be a good part of our portfolio in the low price point. Relative to diversification in the portfolio, we continue to have good diversification. Out of the 2,334 properties, they represent 30 different industries and 118 different chains and in 49 states. The industry exposures were pretty balanced, the largest industry is still restaurants, which is at 21.2%. That’s down a bit from the end of the year and we’ll continue to work that number down. If you break that out, about 12% of that is in family restaurants or what a lot of people call “casual dining.” About half of that is Buffets. About 1% is in dinner houses and in the other 8% is in fast food, which seems to be over-performing the rest of the restaurant industry. Convenience stores are at 17%. They’ve done up a bit due to pretty much across-the-board rent increases this year that we’ve seen from them. Theaters at 9.2% and then child care, which was – has been in our portfolio an awfully long time, is down to 7.6%. From a tenant standpoint, the largest tenant in the portfolio is just over 6%. The next one is 5% and it goes down pretty quickly from there. If you take our top 15 tenants, again, it’s about 52.9% of revenues. When you get to the 15th largest tenant, you are talking about 2% of rent and everybody else in the portfolio is below 2%. So I think pretty well diversified out there, which has been helpful. Average remaining lease terms, about 11.3 years. That's nice to have in this environment. And so as we look at the portfolio, given the tone from the tenants, really not anything going on in the portfolio today and occupancy helping and same-store rents up, we feel pretty good about where we sit with the – here in the fourth quarter. And I think kind of looking forward to the end of this quarter, we really think that we’ll see continued high occupancy and modest same-store rent growth. Kind of the other major thing to talk about today is property acquisitions and after 20 plus months of not buying property and waiting to see if prices would adjust and cap rates get a little better, we have started acquiring again pretty much on a modest basis. You saw in the release during the third quarter, we bought three properties for just short of $11 million at just over 10% cap rate. That transaction was one where a tenant had some immediate cash needs and we were able to go in and help them solve their problem at a pretty good rate of return and was really us getting started again in acquisitions. And it’s kind of interesting. We continue to look at additional transactions. I think we’ll buy some properties here in the fourth quarter and there are a number of transactions in the marketplace that we are looking at today. But if you look at overall volume, I’d have to say it’s certainly modest compared to a few years ago and of the transactions that you do see out there now, I think a number of them still are some people coming to market with some immediate financing needs that might not meet the quality of some of the portfolio acquisitions we would want to make. However, we are starting to see some people tiptoe back into the market with some larger transactions and I’d really say buy size is kind of in the $10 million to $15 million range is what we are seeing out there. Cap rates seem to have stabilized in these portfolio transactions kind of in the 9% to 10% cap rate range and that’s how they are coming out and depending on what they are of the size, the immediacy of need, we’ll kind of tell you whether they are trying to play closer to the 9% side or to the 10% side of that. So while I do see transactions moving up a bit, I think it’s still is pretty modest. I don't think there is a rush of sellers. However, there are not a lot of buyers out there either. So from a competitive standpoint, I think we are in decent shape to compete on the transactions. Relative to themes along industry lines, there doesn't seem to be a lot there. I think we could – anybody could buy a lot of restaurants today. That’s not in our target, given concentration levels. And outside of that, most of what we see is, I think, balance sheet generated as you have folks that are looking – needing to do some financing in the months coming up, that are starting to come out on to the market. And as that continues and you see kind of general balance sheet re-financings needed to be done over the next year or so, we think that will probably accelerate the number of transactions that we see out there in the market, but still pretty modest to date. Moving on to dividends, as always, that’s priority for us and I’d anticipate that the cash dividend would be higher this year than last year and higher next year than this year and that is why we are here and what the shareholders look for. Paul commented on the balance sheet. We did spend about $10 million in cash during the quarter on those acquisitions. We have $20 million in cash sitting there today, continue to have no balance on the $355 million line and with no debt due or mortgages or development JVs, obviously very liquid and able to act should we see something attractive coming up. Let me move on to guidance. For 2009, we tweak the estimates to the $1.83, $1.84 and that’s flat to about 0.5% FFO growth and as we pretty much said over the last year, our estimate range on the low side was from zero acquisitions and then kind of up to $125 million a quarter and since we bought very little this year and quite frankly, since I think anything we might buy in the fourth quarter is likely to close fairly late in the quarter, the impact to incremental acquisitions this year would be very small and so we think the $1.83 to $1.84 is probably a good level given the stability that we are seeing in the portfolio right now. Also, it’s pretty interesting to look at the company right now and it’s one of those moments in time where you say kind of we really haven't bought property over the last 20 months or so. Our Crest Net Lease subsidiary has been essentially shut down. There has really not been any cost cutting going on in the company and pretty much what you are seeing in the company’s operation is our core operations on the portfolio and what is pretty deep into a tougher recession and I think things have held up pretty well. So it’s a good time to observe the portfolio before we go out and start buying again, which then mixes up the numbers a bit. We are also initiating our 2010 estimates in there at $1.86 to $1.92 or 1% to 5% FFO growth and I think that assumes pretty good continued stability in the portfolio, which is what we are seeing at the end of the year now and then also consistent with acquisitions on the low side being very modest next year, maybe zero. And then on the higher side, $250 million to get to those numbers. I would say, however, unlike the beginning of last year when we were out of the acquisitions market, I’d certainly think we would be more acquisitive in 2010 than we were in 2009. The $250 million is not a target. It just was a range from which we could generate some guidance numbers and as we get further into 2010, we will see if we are below the $250 million or above the $250 million and really what happens then. To kind of summarize operations, we are real pleased with the stability of the portfolio and occupancy and same-store rent growth. Our balance sheet is in good condition and then basically, a good quarter and a quiet portfolio and if we can start seeing over the next couple of quarters from acquisition opportunities, that will allow us to accelerate the business a little bit. And with that, I think we’ll go ahead and open it up to questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jeff Donnelly – Wells Fargo: Good afternoon, guys.
Tom Lewis: Hey, Jeff.
Jeff Donnelly – Wells Fargo: Tommy, you talked about it a little bit in your comments, I guess, and I had asked you last quarter, I think where you thought we were in the cycle of store closures and bankruptcies and I guess I’m curious, have you changed at all I guess in the last 90 days, you’ve become more encouraged?
Tom Lewis: Well, I like the idea that we are not dealing with any of them today, which we have been dealing with over the last 18 months. But I think like everybody in the industry today, you spend your time kind of doing scenario planning and our “you and me” camp of – was the flattening out going to be a V or a W and my answer is I really don't know. It wouldn't surprise me to see some continued bankruptcies over the next year or so, absent things really picking up. As we look out there, you see just a little tweak on the durable goods side, getting a tiny bit better, but not much at all and generality, I think people just quit declining and up a little bit. So I don't – I really – I'm not so sure that we are in a stage where, “Gee, it’s recovery from here.” I just think things quit getting worse and some of the retailers that were going to have problems have them.
Jeff Donnelly – Wells Fargo: Is there anything you can share with us I guess on the market for DIP financing because anecdotally we continue to hear that has been challenging for retailers to obtain that sort of financing and that’s been holding off restructuring? If you think that is truth said, do you have any, I guess, impact there?
Paul Meurer: I think dip financing is certainly more easier to get than it was earlier in the year. We were involved in a couple of Chapter 11s where we sat on the committee and chaired committee. And if you go back to January and February, it was a period where I think in everyone you looked at, the company had to work very hard to go out and get their dip financing and if you look today into the ones we hear about, people are able to get a little lease here and it’s opened up a bit.
Jeff Donnelly – Wells Fargo: Just a – last question is, I’m just curious, you have a little over I think 11 years on remaining lease term on all your existing leases. I can’t recall, but has that fluctuated much over time and I guess I’m curious from a portfolio management standpoint. Do you take into consideration when – I guess, as you think about acquisitions and you manage your portfolio? So I would imagine shorter lease terms become more challenging to finance our buyers over time.
Tom Lewis: Yes. Generally, we are seller primarily of properties when we have a problem with them and tend not to be out selling a lot on a regular basis. So that didn’t impact us as much. We are very much at hold for long-term income production. But it’s – that numbers, if you look in the Annual Report you can kind of see it, it just kept kind of going up over the years as we continue to buy and about six, seven years ago we really started moving to a 20-year initial lease terms more than we did 15 and we were buying a lot. So that really expanded out. The second thing that happened is as we started having lease rollovers you get like this year’s lease rollovers that have a month or two or three left and they weight that average and then as soon as you write a new lease, it’s three and usually five years, it goes back up again. Over the last 20 months when we haven't been buying, it’s kind of gone from 12 years down into the lower 11s and now it will be a mix depending on how much we are really buying. But let me try and – absent kind of steady – if you put steady acquisitions not in, not absent, over the years as we get larger and acquisitions are steady and as the portfolio matures, I do think you see the lease terms getting shorter and you have more of the leases turning over each year, it’s more of an issue I think for eight, nine, 10 years down the road and the interesting thing is though you really have to bifurcate the lease rollovers because if it’s the first lease rollover after the end of a 15, 20-year lease, generally it’s a more challenging role than one that is rolling for the second time where they already had a foot on the property and the ones that they are getting now are more profitable. So long and short, as we get out and buy again now, maybe it will move up again.
Jeff Donnelly – Wells Fargo: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone. Please go ahead.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Thanks. Good afternoon. My – Tom, I just want to understand. You had mentioned you had given the rent increases and decreases by industry. Was that just the revenues that those properties produced in the last quarter versus I guess the prior year or was that actually on leases signed in those industries? But I guess I just don't understand what that measure was.
Tom Lewis: Yes, that measure, same-store rent increase is just the same-store properties that were occupied and what the rents were this year versus last year. So if you look across the rent increases that we got were in the industries I mentioned and that’s just the same property, that’s not on new leases signed, that’s on the ones that are existing. I think if you look at new leases signed, you are probably looking at lower – we sign new leases when we buy properties, both actually would be higher today, we haven't bought much. But in terms of looking the lease rollovers, that had some flows and generally has been a lease roll down to over the last couple of years when it picked back up again. And we started the year kind of thinking rollovers were going to be a break-even. I think now we have a – we are thinking more to about a 4% rent roll down and as we get late in the year and we look at lease rollovers, I think we have 2.6% of leases rolling over here in the fourth quarter and that’s our sense on that and that’s what we put in the guidance.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Okay. Okay, got it. And that was – my next question was on the 2.6% rolling over in the fourth quarter. I mean, that’s about the level that you typically announce full year. Is that just a matter of mix and timing or how should we think about that?
Paul Meurer: Yes, that’s exactly what it is. It’s just mix and timing. There were some third quarter ones, but the people also had some fourth quarter rollovers and so they’ve just taken those sum of month to month for a short period of time, we would kind of do a global on it. But if you look at it, there are 92 leases, 70 are second rolls and very profitable properties. So my sense is that those are going to go down pretty smoothly. And some of them went right after the end of September 30 and we are pretty far down the pike on them. So my sense is that you are not going to see a meaningful change in occupancy as a function of those rolls in the fourth quarter.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Okay. And then on your 2010 guidance, just a couple of items. One, do you assume much in the way of an occupancy change, either up or down, in the portfolio?
Tom Lewis: We –
Paul Meurer: About 1% down, just part of the assumption there.
Tom Lewis: And I’m not so sure we think –
Paul Meurer: We are not predicting that. But in terms of the projections, we were assuming say about 1% we have issues with.
Tom Lewis: And we’d be happy not to have it.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Got it. And any major change in G&A next year?
Paul Meurer: No, about the same. About 6.5% to 7% of revenues. We have a plug [ph] now of about $25 million and that – but it really depends on acquisitions. It will be lower if there is a lower acquisition volume number or it will be a full $25 million, maybe a little bit more if we had a lot of acquisitions because acquisition commissions are in that number.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Okay. And then just last question. Give us a sense as to maybe what portion of your leases have tenants where they are leveraged through maybe an LBO and might have upcoming debt maturities that you think about. Just like what portion of the portfolio that might be.
Tom Lewis: Yes, I think there is a fair amount of it that is represented that way. As you know, over the last 40 years, pretty much everybody we’ve worked with have been less than investment grade and I think you look out over the next two, three years, they like most people out there have some maturities that they are going to have to deal with and work on. So I think – I think it’s fairly widespread in the portfolio, which I think we’ve been fairly upfront about.
Anthony Paolone – JPMorgan: Okay. And I appreciate the extra disclosure on the tenancy. Thank you.
Tom Lewis: Our pleasure and thank you for those people’s input who gave it to us quite firmly and occasionally you need that and I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: Hi guys. It’s Greg Schweitzer here.
Tom Lewis: Hey, Greg.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: So I’m just talking about the acquisitions that you did this quarter. What type of industry were the assets that you acquired in?
Tom Lewis: Primarily health and fitness and obviously, there weren’t a lot. So that’s an area that we continue to be focused on we liked a lot.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: And you said those were more to do with specific problems with those tenants.
Tom Lewis: Not a problem with the tenants, it’s just that they had some debt coming due and needed some money and I got them on the balance sheet and that was an opportunity that we could help them out very quickly. But I’m – I wouldn't put it as a problem they had. They just needed some capital.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: Right. Could you provide a bit more detail into the sort of deals that you have seen for this quarter, the process on how you switched through them, if that changed a little?
Tom Lewis: Yes, I don't know that it’s really changed. I know that we are not focusing on restaurants at all. The only thing that’s really changed is we had a few more one-off property things come through that we’ll take a look at and that’s really a function of the vast majority of the buyers and tripling that leases over the last six, seven, eight years have been guys doing 10-31 exchange, buying one or two properties and they pretty much exited the marketplace in mass. I think primarily it’s a function of not having sold properties with gains anymore. And so you see a few more one-offs and so that’s one difference. And then you tend not to see a lot of big M&A transactions. There are a few rumbling, but – so I think it’s rather than the $100 million to $200 million portfolio as you look at, more of them – most of them were more buy sized and I described kind of the $10 million to $50 million to $60 million size transactions and it’s really I think by the tenants as more of a financing that they are doing. It’s been a question from them, do they do access to the bond markets, do they have access to the bank markets. Certainly don’t have access to CMBS that they might have a few years ago. And so they are coming out and testing the waters there. I would also say though that as you look is the debt markets have opened up and I think some of the people have been able to access the high-yield market more. I think most of them have had a little pressure taking off and maybe there hasn't the volume come to market that you thought there would be. But outside of that, they look pretty much like what we were looking at a couple of years ago. The cap rate is different and then I think tenants are a little more open to us, discussing with them that the cash flow coverages need to be a little higher than maybe they were a couple of years ago. If you probably took the average over the last three, four years, the coverages we were buying out was around 2.5 overall on a portfolio and then the spread was kind of 175 [ph] up to whatever, 3 or 4. And as you look today, it’s 2.5 plus and you are probably looking on the low side that if they have properties today that are below much of a 2 coverage, you are saying to them that you don't really want them and unlike a couple of years, the comment you get back is not, “Okay, I’ll sell them to someone else,” because there is not a lot of buyers.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: Okay, great. And could you provide some more just general industry color, specifically on the auto and tire services, home improvement and health and fitness exposure?
Tom Lewis: Yes. I mean, if you – let me glance at the press release here and get back to those pages. Maybe we can go through them kind of one by one. You want to give me those industries again?
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: Auto and tire service.
Tom Lewis: Yes, auto and tire service, you see there is 6.8%. You noticed in our disclosure that we did mention TBC, which is a very large – Sumitomo is a very large seller of tires and they were a primary tenant there. And then we have a number of other chains. They are the only one that over – that approaches 2% and the rest of them below them and we have four, five tenants in there. Their business generally has been perked initially by the recession because I think on a marginal basis they make their money when someone comes in and buys some rims or upgrades tires and what you found is people stepping back away from that and then trying to defer buying tires and now what you are seeing in the cycle is that the folks that didn’t go out and buy new cars and kept driving their car, now they are having to replace the tires and they tend to be doing okay. I wouldn't say it’s great, but okay. But I would also say we have pretty good coverages in those stores.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: How about auto service, without the tires?
Tom Lewis: Yes. Auto service is kind of the same business for it. The loop business, which we have a little bit of, is probably a little more meaningfully impacted because they used to come in with a cheap loop and try and sell up and I think the customer is more resistant, but we really haven't heard any noise there out of the tenant. And then in the repair area, it’s kind of the same thing. People put off repairs early on, but we are getting deep into the recession and you don't buy new car, and they seem to be doing a little bit better there. But I wouldn't say that it’s doing great, they are doing okay.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: And then the other two, home improvement and health and fitness?
Tom Lewis: Yes, home improvement for us is actually doing okay because that’s some hardware stores that we have and it tends not to be a lot of home improvement, it’s more kind of hardware, but we tucked them into that one and they’ve reported to us that their business isn’t bad and that’s kind of the majority of it in there. And what was the last one? I’m sorry.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: The gyms.
Tom Lewis: The gyms are doing fine. We have – our primary tenant there is L.A. Fitness and there are 300 – I think 49-unit chain that we’ve dealt with since they had 40 units and they’ve rolled out across United States. That industry is generally doing pretty good, but it’s bifurcated depending on the revenue structure of how these guys book their revenue and what they are selling and those that were the really fancy gyms with a lot of add-on services that were sold in products, I think have seen a softening while the overall membership has held up okay. But these guys are kind of bread and butter, which is basically working out and training. They have a really good store and a really good model and they’ve kept their profitability up very nicely. Our other tenant in the industry has had some problems, but we were able four, five years ago to kind of cherry pick up six or seven of their very profitable properties. So we like that industry. The baby boomer seem to be migrating to it as they realize they are not going to live forever and generally, these guys have held up pretty good when we look at the numbers.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: That’s helps a lot. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Fick with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
David Fick – Stifel Nicolaus: Thank you. Good afternoon. I’d like to second the appreciation for the added disclosure. Tom, I’m wondering if you might care to comment on some of the public statements that have been made by some short investors in your stock. I know you’ve been getting calls from investors about that as well as the (inaudible) that occurred this quarter. Any response to the specific commentary that’s been out there regarding tenant quality and your business model?
Tom Lewis: Yes, I’ll kind of do a wandering response, maybe. I don't have anything specific. First of all, just relative to short positions, I got into the securities in the ‘70s and one of the things we understand about the public market is people who are always long, people who are short, you are going to have people with buy rating, sell ratings, and neutral and between that and buying, selling that’s kind of what makes up liquidity and valuation, which is great. And generally, we’ve been very well treated by the market and quite frankly, we continue to be so. But I think overall, I kind of get the mathematics of the simple story, which is real estate plus retail plus less-than investment grade tenants plus recession might equal short or a problem. And I think there is a pretty good disconnect out there in the market and it’s not atypical for people that are fairly new to looking at the company about how we fare with our tenants that are less than investment grade, generally verse the unsecured debt and equity of those people and maybe a good way to talk about it, David, is just kind of talk about bankruptcy and kind of our history there. Is that kind of a good way to go?
David Fick – Stifel Nicolaus: Sure.
Tom Lewis: It’s kind of interesting; in 40 years we worked almost exclusively with less-than investment grade tenants. Occupancy has never been below 96% and if it’s 96.8% today and I think it’s interesting to note that tenants having problems, having bankruptcies has been a normal part of our business, pretty much as long as we’ve been in business. And I think we understand the process and what happens. And I also think that we understand that the misperception really lies in that the equity gets pretty hard when these guys go into bankruptcy. The debt gets substantially refigured and we tend to do pretty well and I’ll – first, I’ll just kind of give you the numbers. Since we went public 15 years ago, we have had 22 of our tenants file for bankruptcy. Those 22 tenants represented 33% of our revenue, not all of them obviously went at the same time, but you take them in mass for those 22 and at the time they went, you add them all up, it’s a third of our revenue. And they’ve – that represented 414 properties over that period of time. 322 of them or 78% were accepted in bankruptcy, which meant there was very little that happened to us on those properties and we kept leasing those and obviously got paid during the reorganization. 92 were rejected, which is 22% of the properties and if you take the 22 bankruptcies, in the year at – in the year after the end of the bankruptcy and we got paid rents during the bankruptcy, we recaptured 89% of the pre-bankruptcy rents. So as the landlord – and in particular with the landlord with their profitable stores, we have tended to do better than one might have thought. And the interesting thing, you take those 15 years and those tenants and I think during that period of time are FFO went up about 80% and our dividends went up about 75%. And so we know how to process works, it’s the normal part of the business. I think kind of the second question for the few people who’ve done some work on this is they didn’t say, “Okay, that’s great. But today is different, it’s a harder environment, we are in a recession, the consumers were soft.” And so, let me just kind of little additional disclosure, take the last 18 months and I’ll walk you through. In 2008 and 2009, which is pretty during the middle of the recession, we had six of our tenants in our portfolio that filed for bankruptcy. The six tenants over the last 18 months represented 12.6% of our revenue. This time, it was pretty much all at the same time that involved 208 properties. 172 of the properties were accepted, that’s 83%. 36 were rejected, that’s 17%. And if you look at the six bankruptcies, the recapture is about 83.3% of pre-filing rents in the year following. So kind of six tenants, 12.6% of revenue and 83% recapture during the last 18 months and as I mentioned before, during the process we generally get administrative rents on the properties. So if you kind of look over the 15-year period, the recapture rate is about 89% and I think 78% of the properties were accepted. If you look over the last 18 months, which was six of these Chapter 11s, you've had 83% accepted, actually a little higher rent rate, but I think the recapture a little lower than one might accept during the recession. And if you look relate it back to what I said earlier, it’s kind of interesting given we haven't bought anything and Crest isn’t doing anything and we haven't cut expenses, you can get an idea of deep into a recession, having 12.6% of our revenue with tenants in bankruptcy, what happens to FFO, which is fairly flat over the last year, same-store rent up a bit, occupancy basically flat. So I think that might be illuminating for some of the folks out there.
David Fick – Stifel Nicolaus: Very helpful. One specific question. Going through your Form 3, we noted that you’ve got a handful of entertainment properties, probably list of this entertainment that have a fairly large land base and minimal construction or building improvement. What is the nature of those assets? Is it just categorized as entertainment?
Tom Lewis: Yes, those have been in the portfolio for a long time and generally, those are a combination, they are primarily small properties located on freeways where you’ve got miniature golf, you’ve got go-karts, and you’ve got a wide variety of entertainment. And a couple of chains that we've worked with – because I don't think we bought any of those in five, six, seven years. But what we did when we went and looked at those is we looked at them primarily on a land basis and not paying for the improvements, because obviously the improvements are a little difficult to lease to somebody else for a different purpose, and basically tried to value the land and the surrounding areas and pay that. And then what we did is we wrote a very long-term triple net lease on it and the net effect to it is the cash flow coverages were extraordinarily high and it was the way we cut on the land and quite frankly, over time, prices of land went up and if those guys there were defaulted we would be in very good shape. The other nice side of it is it’s fairly low-priced entertainment and so, the cash flows have held up decently. We haven't had close to a default in any of that. But it’s land under those type of properties, if you are in Orlando – not Orlando, if you are in South Florida right of the I-75 across from a major shopping center and you looked, you would see a 100-acre site and it would have some rice on it and it would have miniature golf and baseball and all the rest of it and it sits right in the middle of retail and the 100 acres, the lands owned by us, we bought it at 4 bucks a foot and now you just spread that around the country. We own some of that up in riverside in San Diego and really throughout the country. So a very small part of the portfolio, we tried like heck to go out and buy tons of it. The problem is we just couldn’t find enough chains that were in that business.
David Fick – Stifel Nicolaus: Just looked a little unusual, but it sounds like it’s actually relatively healthy. So thanks. My last question is, I’m wondering if you had a look at the Exxon portfolio that recently transacted into Greater Washington area, one of your peer group companies, Getty Realty, buying it at an 11-4 cap rate convenient stores and Exxon gas station.
Tom Lewis: Yes, we were aware of that transaction out there and others like it, but kind of the policy is post we tend not to comment on it and then we find that we continue on the list of people that see that stuff.
David Fick – Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Tom Lewis: I don't comment on that so well on it, just so you know.
David Fick – Stifel Nicolaus: Right.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of R.J. Milligan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
R.J. Milligan – Raymond James: Good afternoon, guys.
Tom Lewis: Hi, R.J.
R.J. Milligan – Raymond James: Just a quick question. Most of my questions have been answered, but the – typically you guys provide the range for the top 15 tenants in terms of coverage.
Paul Meurer: Yes.
Tom Lewis: Yes, I didn’t – I’m happy to do it. I didn’t do it this quarter. A lot of these people report annually, some of them report on the date of the lease of the various properties and if you run through the third quarter, it tends to be when there is smallest amount of changes of people reporting the cash flow coverage. So I think there was only one or two, but it was relatively flat. I think the low end was 155 [ph] and the high end of kind of doesn't matter because it’s so good, it’s somewhere up 3.5 or so, but it didn’t really change much at all because the tenant that did report, the major one, was right in the middle and the other reports we got, which had to do with individual properties, didn’t change the numbers that much. Probably the best time of the year when that – when we have the best numbers there is after the first quarter.
R.J. Milligan – Raymond James: Okay, thanks. And one more quick question. Can you just describe the thought process for including the additional disclosures this quarter?
Tom Lewis: Yes. Really and I’ll kind of go back to the start. Previous to – right after we went public, we continued with the policy where every year we put every tenant, every property and its address on the back on the Annual Report and then what we would do is at the end of the quarter, we’d say what we bought, who the tenant was and what the cap rate was and we did our first conference call just probably 12 or 13 years ago and when we did, the world listened in and we lost our biggest tenant we were buying things from when they got under-priced by a competitor who just went right 25 BPs below and we lost a big deal. And then we lost the second biggest guy we were doing business with when they were bombarded with calls saying, people would their properties 50 to 75 basis points below what we would do. And if you look back then, pretty much anybody we were doing new transactions with would move into the top 10 or 15. So we came out with the analysts that covered us and said that we are not going to disclose tenant name and a lot of all this other disclosure and because we’d rather be doing business and not reporting the tenant name than not doing business but having more disclosure and everybody were fine probably until about I’d say a year ago. And as we moved into the recession, we understand there – understood there were some more pressures and we were kind of stuck on the policy. And I will tell you that one of the analyst that’s on the call and then somebody also who is well known in the industry, very well respected, might have known for 25 years, called me up said, “Hey, can we have an open conversation”? And I listen to them and then we discussed it in-house. And what we also realized is now if you look at the top 15, the chance that we are doing substantial acquisitions with those guys is much lower than it used to be and it’s probably going to be a name that won’t get into the top 15. So we’ve put on a lot of acquisitions. But I think the reason for not doing it didn’t have the efficacy it had in the past and the added disclosure everybody would find helpful. So that was the decision process.
R.J. Milligan – Raymond James: Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Todd Lukasik with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Hi, thanks for taking my question.
Paul Meurer: Hi, Todd.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Hi, just one thing you had mentioned earlier, Paul, I think with reference to an assumption that you are using with regards to 1% decrease in occupancy. Was that for through the rest of '09 or was that for fiscal year of 2010?
Paul Meurer: Fiscal year 2010.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Okay, great. And then, Tom, you kind of answered this with your last answer I guess. But I was just curious if you all would be inclined or if you had a preference to increase your exposure through future acquisitions through existing tenants or if you had a preference to looking at new tenants to add to the roster?
Tom Lewis: We’ll do both, new tenants are always the best because we really like the diversification. But we are aware of the kind of the concentration, so when somebody gets up over 5% then we look very carefully before we want to add very much more on, not because we don't like the tenant, just general diversification. And we’d like to keep the industries down a bit. So new tenants are always the best, but we do have some tenants that were fairly small and you look at the top 15 and they get to down 2% of rents, there are only seven tenants between 1% and 2% and then it goes down very quickly. So there is still a pretty good list of 90 tenants or 85 tenants that are out there.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Right, okay. And then one last question too with regards to your top 15 tenants I guess and my guess is that it’s very small, but I was wondering if you could give an average and maybe a range for your top 15 tenants for the percentage of their stores that you will own in your portfolio?
Tom Lewis: Yes, let me see if I can kind of run through it. I’ll do it quickly. Buffets have 547 units, we have a 104; Kerasotes has 98 theaters, we own 17; L.A. Fitness has 329 units, we own 18; and TreeHouse 1,667 stores, we own 147; Friendly’s has 311 stores, I think we own 121; Rite Aid has 4,825 stores, we have 42; La Petite has 1,112 stores and we have 111; TBC, which is the highest stored chain, has 1,186 stores, we have 68; Boston Market has 541 stores, we have 77; KinderCare has 1,800 units, we have 85; Couche-Tard, which is Circle K, has 5,900 stores, we have 108; NPC International, which is Pizza Hut’s largest franchisee, has 1,153 stores, we have 141; FreedomRoads has 46 stores, we have 16; Regal – Regal has – do you have Regal there, Paul?
Paul Meurer: Yes. Regal has 550 stores, we have 12.
Tom Lewis: And then, Sports Authority has 463 units and we have 12.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Okay. That’s very helpful. Thanks. Yes, that’s all I had. Thanks again for taking my questions. And Paul, we are looking forward to your participation in the Morningstar Stock Conference next week.
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Todd.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Hi, good afternoon guys. With the acquisition this quarter, was that a new tenant?
Tom Lewis: It was, yes.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Any – your comments there, any – is there any additional stores that those guys might have beyond the three that they have?
Tom Lewis: Not at the moment, but should they, we'd be interested.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: So they – did they actually have other locations or it was just those three?
Tom Lewis: No, they have other locations at the chain.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, okay. So there is a potential possibility to have those guys again. Okay. And then, health and fitness you were talking about, that seems to something that’s growing – that's certainly growing in the table. Is that – is there any particular reason for that target? I mean, are you seeing more of that kind of product out there?
Tom Lewis: We’ve really gone to – we actually own some health and fitness. I mean, going back 25, 28 years, had some problem with it like 22 years ago and got out of the business, but continued to watch it and what happened is that about – oh gosh, 12, 13 years ago, these guys came up with a new model and now basically all of the chains that are growing have gone through, which is like a 40,000 square foot store and there is an area to the left where they kind of have their sales team and then it’s got the basics out there and has training and it’s got room where they can do a lot of things with it. And they started booking their revenue differently and their newer, larger units right about that 40,000 really took off and we got together with L.A. Fitness and the vast majority of their stores didn’t hit that model, but their first few that did the numbers were just off the chart. So we started doing those. And then, later on the other chart change started going in that area and it was first a change in the type of building that worked very well for them and then I think what’s happened in the last few years is demographics that helped them out and the baby boomers are kind of rediscovering that they are not going to live forever, I’m one of them, so I belong to two of these things. But much to my chagrin, I recently learned you have to actually go to them, you don't have to just be a member.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: And you can’t go to it once I guess so [ph]?
Tom Lewis: You can’t, but by the way there are about 30,000 clubs nationwide. I know they all don't fit the silk, but that’s the size of the industry and if you look from 1991 to 2009, kind of the compound annual growth rate for the industry has been close to 9% a year. So it has been a big growth industry and continues to grow.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay. So you would see that 6%, that is health and fitness, that you would see that growing over the next couple of years?
Tom Lewis: We wouldn't mind it at all if it went up to 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%. We think it’s a great industry and kind of hits the baby boomers moving into their – the age they are moving into. The issue then is trying to find the appropriate tenants and it isn’t a huge list of chains out there, but it’s a good list.
Paul Meurer: Hey, Rich, one thing I’ll add is that Tom’s comment is very positively on L.A. Fitness specifically. That’s actually a perfect example of why we hesitated for so long with our tenant list. When L.A. Fitness was in that, say, 10th largest tenant or in that 10 to 15 range, we were still doing a lot of business with them and they really weren’t doing business with other net lease providers at that time. So that’s a good example of that and somebody we’ve been pleased to work with and really rises up in terms of our investment with them.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, good. Thanks, guys. And then, I thank you, Paul, and then on the flipside, child care was coming down pretty fast as a percentage. Does that continue to fall like that or it levels off this quarter, but does it – do you think it kind of keeps going down?
Tom Lewis: I really think it will continue to go down. We’ve been in the business now. I think we started buying it 28 years ago when we started in the child day care business, it was 50% of our portfolio and now it’s down to about 7.6%. And when we founded it was really just starting to grow and the kind of the primary driver of the business is going back to the ’60s. The numbers were only about 20% of women of childbearing age in the United States worked. And so there was a lot of stay-at-home and that obviously has changed dramatically. I think the last time I looked a few years ago, it was up to 60% plus of women of childbearing age worked and that was the primary growth of the industry and then you really coupled it back when we got into it that the baby boomers were having kids and so the growth was really fantastic, nobody else was financing the business. There weren’t any institutional players and we got involved. We then backed off primarily as a function of what was 50% of our revenue when went public and have worked it down. And then the second thing that really happened is the percentage of women in the workforce kind of flattened out, it got to where it was kind of going to get. So that growth you had really went away and then the second thing is as the baby boomers kind of moved out of childbearing age and the baby bust moved into it and so you really saw a moderation of the growth of their business. As you look at the business today, I don't think the percentage of women in the childbearing age in the workforce is going to go up dramatically, but the one thing they do have that will help them out is you now have the echo of baby boom moving into childbearing age. So it’s a good industry, but I don't think it’s going to grow much larger.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, all right. Good, thanks. And then remind me again what the 300 non-same-stores are.
Tom Lewis: Yes, that is those stores that were vacant at anytime during the comp period. It’s also those stores that went through lease rollover for a period of time and came off lease for a short period of time. It’s those properties that have been released and anything that wasn't in the comp set that had been acquired.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets: Okay, great. Very good, thank you guys.
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Good afternoon, guys.
Paul Meurer: Hey, Chris.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Just a couple of detail questions, Paul. On the G&A guidance, you will include – your numbers include the FAS 141R expenses?
Paul Meurer: Yes, it does.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then, are you going to be providing at least a footnote to separate out that from what has been the traditional sort of accounting process so we could get an apples-to-apples view?
Paul Meurer: Yes, we’ve been thinking about that because we only had a little bit of it with these couple of properties we brought in the third quarter, but I think that’s a very good suggestion and I don't think it’s going to be a huge number, but we’ll certainly break that out.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Is there a – I mean, as you think about your range of acquisitions and obviously filtering into your numbers, how should we be thinking about that relationship between acquisition volume and the ramp in G&A?
Paul Meurer: I – the acquisition commissions are one thing, meaning kind of what we pay a little bit of additional compensation internally relative to our acquisition folks or maybe if we have to pay a – maybe an outside advisor who is involved in helping us get an acquisition across the line. But in terms of the due diligence side of it, it’s not a big number. So it depends on the property type and the number of properties we are dealing with, but we are estimating 5,000 to 7,500 if you will, per property is that. So it all depends on the particular situation and the work that needs to be done.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: And that would include your transfer taxes or whatever that would be applicable to the various regions?
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Yes. For the most part, yes. You are going to have a few states where you have an anomaly on that where your transfer taxes are going to be a little higher.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then on the unsecured debt market, can you give us a sense as to what you are hearing in terms of what your debt would be issued at this point?
Paul Meurer: We actually aren’t actively asking for quotes every day. So I don't have this week’s quote, if you will. But we certainly know the market is and if you assume the 10 years around 3.5%, I think you are looking at a spread for us of somewhere certainly in the 350 to 400 over range, I would hope on the tighter side of that. So with that a cost of 7% to 7.5%.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then on the – on – just on underwriting acquisitions, I guess with some of these additional details you guys have provided today, which has been very helpful, is there a limit as to how many units you’ll take from a particular credit?
Tom Lewis: I don't. We don't have an absolute limit, but when wee start owning all of it or close to all of it, then we are thoughtful about it. However, what we have found out is if we do have a big position, then certainly if something goes sideways, we can be a player in it because we control a lot of the assets. It really speaks to more, if you take a retailer and you look and say, okay, this retailer has an average of – I’ll just ballpark it if there are any pays, cash flow coverage EBITDA, cash flow coverage at 2 times, it almost though is it’s going to a bell curve, Chris. And to one side, he is going to have some low coverage units and so if you bought all of them, you would end up with low coverage units. So we just assume trying to get a small enough subset so we can say to the other side of the bell curve and have higher cash flow coverages.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Okay. And then my last question. Just on the – obviously, you exceeded the bogey you wanted to hit you talked about for several quarters in terms of the cap rate on the deals that you closed this past quarter. What are your thoughts right now in terms of where – what cap rates you would be looking at doing given the sort of healing that’s going on in the debt markets?
Tom Lewis: I really that’s moderated, I think, caps a little bit and we’ll have to see what happens there, but my sense is of the deals that we kind of – transactions going through the pipeline, probably the best is to say in the 9% to 10% range and then you are thinking 9.5%, but then you watch the debt markets very closely because that will move things along. So I’d ballpark it at 9.5%.
Chris Lucas – Robert W. Baird: Great. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Since there are no further questions at this time, I will now turn it over to management for closing remarks.
Tom Lewis: Well, thank you very much everybody and we’ll see you again in another 90 days and see how this all carries along in the economy. I appreciate the support.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Realty Income second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. You many disconnect. Thank you for using ACT Conferencing.

===== 2009 Q2  (2009-07-31 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Tom Lewis - CEO Gary Malino - President and COO Paul Meurer - EVP and CFO Tere Miller - VP, Corporate Communications
Analysts: Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo Greg Schweitzer - Citigroup Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets Andrew DiZio - Janney Montgomery Scott
Operator: Welcome to the Realty Income's Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. (Operator instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead.
Tom Lewis: The purpose, obviously, of this call is to go over our operations and results for the second quarter of 2009. With me in the room today is Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Tere Miller, our Vice President, Corporate Communications. As always, during this conference call, we will be making certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater deal on the company's quarterly and Form 10-Q the factors that may cause such differences. With that out of the way, we'll start the way we normally do, with Paul reviewing the numbers in the quarter. Paul?
Paul Meurer: As usual, I'm going to comment on the financial statements briefly, provide a few highlights of our financial results for the quarter, starting with the income statement. Total revenue decreased slightly for the quarter from $82 million to $81.6 million. Rental revenue was slightly down for the comparative quarter, because we actually sold 30 properties over the past year and we have not acquired any new additional properties. We owned 2,367 properties at June 30 of last year, while we own only 2,338 properties now. Same-store rental revenue actually increased 0.5% for the quarterly period, and excluding Buffets, same-store rent growth was even healthier at 1.5% for the quarter. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $209,000 in the comparative quarterly period. Interest expense decreased for the quarter to $21.4 million, and of course, this reduction reflects the retirement of $120 million of our bonds over the past year. We had zero borrowings on our credit facility throughout the entire quarter, in fact, year-to-date. On a related note, our coverage ratios remained strong, with interest coverage at 3.5 times and fixed charge coverage at 2.7 times. General and administrative expenses in the second quarter decreased significantly by over $900,000. This is primarily due to lower overall compensation. We expect G&A expenses in 2009 to remain flat or lower as compared to 2008 at only about 6.5% of total revenues. Property expenses were about $1.9 million in the quarter. These expenses are primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance, and insurance expenses, which we become responsible for on properties that are available for lease. These expenses have increased somewhat. In addition, we did record additional bad debt expense in the second quarter of $585,000, although we do not expect bad debt expense to be as high in future quarters. Our current estimate for property expenses in total for all of 2009 is about $7 million. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company, and these taxes total $308,000 for the quarterly period. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $2,448,000. Real estate acquired for resale, of course, refers to the operations of Crest Net Lease, our subsidiary that acquires and resells properties. Crest did not acquire or sell any properties in the quarter, and overall, Crest contributed income or FFO of $226,000 in the quarter. Real estate held for investment refers to property sales by Realty Income from our existing core portfolio. We did sell 9 properties during the second quarter resulting overall in income of $2.2 million. These property sales gains are not included in our funds from operations. Preferred stock cash dividends remained at $6.1 million for the quarter, and net income available to common stockholders was $26.5 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO was approximately $47 million for the quarter. FFO per share was $0.46 per share. When we file our 10-Q, we will again provide information you need to compute our adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends. Our AFFO, or actual cash available for distribution, is typically higher than our FFO, because we have relatively low capital expenditures and we do not have a lot of straight line rent in the portfolio. We increased our monthly dividend, again, this quarter. We’ve increased the dividend 47 consecutive quarters and 54 times overall, since we went public almost 15 years ago. Our current monthly dividend is now $0.142375 per share which equates to a current annualized amount of $1.7085 per share. Now let's turn to the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. Our debt-to-total market capitalization today is 33%, and our preferred stock outstanding represents just 8% of our capital structure. All of these liabilities are fixed rate obligations. We continue to have zero borrowings on our $355 million credit facility. This facility also has a $100 million accordion expansion feature. The initial term of this facility runs until May 2011, plus two one-year expansion options thereafter. We have $35 million of cash on hand, and our next debt maturity isn't until 2013. In summary, we currently have excellent liquidity, and our overall balance sheet remains healthy and safe. We have no exposure to variable rate debt and we have no need to raise capital for any balance sheet maturities for the next four years. Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom, who will give you some more background on these results.
Tom Lewis: As I run through all of these areas I guess I'll start by saying, like last quarter, it was a fairly quiet quarter, which in this environment I guess is a pretty good thing. I'll start with the portfolio which is doing pretty well right now, given the state of retail. The tenants in the portfolio that we are talking to have generally seen their business stabilize a bit in the second quarter. That's what we are hearing so far in the third quarter also, really not hearing much from them relative to additional declines in their businesses as we were late last year and earlier in the year. So things seem to have settled down a little bit. While we have worked with a few of the tenants to get through some issues, we are very fortunate we've dodged a lot of the failures that have occurred out there in retail, and in the few cases where we have had some situations with retailers, we've had either just a few properties or we have owned their more profitable properties. So we really weren't impacted or been able to lease a few properties and that's why occupancies remained fairly high. The other thing as always we talk about cash flow coverages of rent down at the store level, which kind of creates our margin of safety and when times get tough for retailers, allows us to do well with the properties we have. If you look at the top-15 tenants for the second quarter, they accounted for about 53.2% of our rent, and if you look at the EBITDA-to-rent coverage, at the end of the first quarter, it was about 2.39 times and ranged from a low of one tenant at 1.22 times upto about 3.75. At the end of the second quarter, those numbers were an average of about 2.46 and ranged from a low of about 1.55 up to 3.59. So a little positive movement overall and the lower end improving especially, which is the one we care about. So the cash flow coverage has held up pretty well and I think that's one of the reasons that the portfolio continues to perform. As you saw in the release, we ended the quarter at 96.6% occupancy with 79 properties available for lease in the portfolio. That's up 20 basis points from the end of last quarter which we're happy about. Additionally, same-store rents, as Paul mentioned, were up 0.5% during the quarter, absent the Buffets, a little bit higher. I would think that given the economy and what's going on in retail that when you look at same-store rent growth, I think it will continue to be positive, but I also think it will be muted this year and then, we'll get into next year and see what the economies look like then. So I think with that said, any same-store rent growth today obviously is a big positive. For the second quarter, to give you an idea where the same-store rent increases come from, we had five different industries in the portfolio that have some declining same-store rents. Those, as you might expect, were in the restaurants and motor vehicle dealership area and that was the majority of it. The rest were small. There were three industries that had flat same-store rents, which was apparel, book stores, office supplies, which I think from what most of us were looking at in retail make sense. Then there were 22 industries that saw same-store rent increases, with the biggest increases really coming primarily from the convenience store areas, also tire stores and health and fitness. If you kind of walk through the portfolio, what seems to be working today, and this has really been the theme all year, is basic goods and services that you buy on an ongoing basis or things at a low price point or kind of the value proposition. I think if you look at the portfolio that probably equates to about two-thirds of what we have in the portfolio. On the flip side, kind of the durable goods, apparel, high ends, consumer discretionary, and the big box stuff, I think is the weaker things in retail and that's a smaller part of our business which helps. Anyway, same-store rents were up again this quarter. We think we continue to be well-diversified. As Paul mentioned, we have 2,338 properties in the portfolio, 30 retail industries, 118 different chains in 49 states. The count is down 9 properties in the portfolio from last quarter from the sales that you saw in the release and the industry exposures continue to be pretty well-diversified. Our largest industry continues to be restaurants. That was at 21.1% at the end of the quarter and down a bit from the end of the year and we'll continue to work that one down. Convenience stores at 16.9%. That was up a bit due to really across the board rent increases on about 5 different tenants in the convenience store business and that industry continues to do pretty well. Theaters were at 9.2%. Obviously, movie theaters are enjoying a really good year, again, this year with I think their revenue up about 8% so far this year. And then child care is about 7.5% of the portfolio, which seems to be doing okay in this environment. Largest tenant is about 6% of rent. Next one's about 5.4%, and then it goes down pretty quickly from there. The top-10 tenants comprise about 40% of the revenue. The top-15, as I mentioned, about 53%. And to give you a sense, when you get to the 15th tenant, you're talking only about 2% of rent, so pretty well-diversified. The lease links on the portfolios continue to be pretty healthy at 11.6 years. Most of that's really occurring from releasing on the longer leases those leases that are going through lease rollover. If you look at lease rollover, the balance of the year, we feel pretty about it. We've got 105 properties that should go through lease rollover between now and the end of the year. That equates to about 2.8% of rent, but the vast majority of those that equate to about 2.2% of rent are subsequent expirations. That means those properties already went through their 15 to 20-year lease. At the end of the lease, they were the profitable properties. The tenants released them, and generally, you have very high rates of release on those. So we anticipate that we should do very well on lease rollover the balance of the year, and it's obviously a very manageable number. Overall, then, at 96.6% and same-store rent's up a bit, the portfolio continues to be pretty stable and have good performance. Let me move on to property acquisitions. As you saw in the release, we continued to remain inactive during the second quarter and waiting for property prices to adjust downward and cap rates up. It's been about 20 months since we put out an LOI right now on a property and so we've been doing this for a while. At this point, property prices have come down a fair bit. Cap rates have come up, as we expected. We're really now starting to see a number of transactions that come through the door that are starting to get to the cap rate expectations or up into the area around 10 cap range or so where we start to get interested. And I think very much sellers are becoming more realistic, and the bid/ask spread is narrowing, which will probably lead to some opportunities here in the second half of the year. And it's always interesting when you get a big bid/ask spread; my experience is that it tends to close as a function of prices moving up rather than down and I think that's what's happening. So we're starting to see a pick up in activity relative to what we're underwriting. As most of you recall, when things do get into the committee and we underwrite them, we end up buying about 12 to 14% of what comes through committee. What's been going on over the last really 6 to 12 months is that a lot of things haven't been coming to the committee because the yields weren't approaching where we wanted to be, but now at cap rates approaching up into the 10-cap range, we're starting to see more come through committee, and I know that there'll be some modest acquisitions in the third quarter and I'll really define that as a trickle and we'll see where it goes from there. In talking about cap rates, I mentioned this last quarter, but I think it really is worthwhile saying, and that is if you look back on the 40 years that we've been doing this and follow cap rates, from 2005 to 2008, we were buying in the 8.4% to 8.7% cap rate range, and in those years bought about $1.5 billion worth of property. I'd probably estimate that we were 75 to 100 basis points in cap rate above where the one-off market was which was really a function of buying in bulk and you get a better price and a better cap rate. From 2003 to 2004, the caps were around 9.5%, and if you go back to when we went public in '94 and take it to 2003, I went back and looked, and the cap rates during that period were always between 10% and 11%. Then, going back and looking at transactions going all the way back before '94, cap rates were pretty much always up 11% or so. So I really think that kind of the 7% and 8% caps that you saw at retail and even some of the 9% caps on the institutional transaction, like a lot of assets in many different areas were a function of the abundant and cheap financing that was out there and it shouldn't be too surprising to see cap rates moving up again. As they approach the 10% area, I think there'll be some opportunities. We think acquisitions will move out. How quickly, I don't know, but I do know we were out looking at transactions and buying again. Moving on to dividends, that's obviously the priority at the company. We'll pay it in cash. The majority of our shareholders are retired and pay bills with their dividends. So that's how we really focus around here. I'd anticipate that the dividend will be higher this year than last year. I would be hopeful it would be higher next year than this year and that's a primary driver for the company. Paul mentioned the balance sheet, and I'll just relate to it into the fact that with no financings coming up, there's no great need for cash that we have outside of acquisitions. We've got about $35 million in cash on hand to spend, and our credit facility has no balance on the $355 million. So we're obviously very liquid here should some opportunities come up. In the guidance, we tweaked the top-end down a $0.01, $1.83, $1.86, and left the bottom side of it alone. That's just a little under 0 to, I think, 1.6%, 1.7% growth. In the last quarter, we had our range for acquisitions at 0 to $250 million, and in our expectations here, we've left it at 0 to $250 million and really assume if we get to the $250 million, it's likely to be weighted towards the end of the year, but we have kept the guidance where we had it except for the $0.01 on the top end and it will just be a function on the bottom end kind of no or very little acquisitions. On the top end, I think things being decent in the portfolio throughout the end of the year and then acquiring about $250 million. And while it's hard to have visibility in this market, given the portfolios held up pretty well and the lease links that we have on the portfolio, I think that that's a good estimate for right now, and we'll stay with that. To summarize then, as I said, pretty pleased with the portfolio through this environment. Starting to see some acquisition opportunities and other than that pretty much a quiet quarter. And with that, Luke, I will turn it back over to you, and we'll take some questions if anybody has.
Operator: (Operator instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.
Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo: Your restaurant exposure, relative to some other folks out there, is fairly high, and it's sort of above where it's been historically for you folks and clearly that industry has been under some degree of pressure. What's your thinking on the future about your exposure there as it relates to may be a buy/sell decision? The basis of this is really because unemployment is high, savings rates are up. It doesn't feel like there's a quick turn at hand for restaurant profitability.
Tom Lewis: Yes, at the end of '07, we had bought a fair amount of restaurants and at that time when we got over 20, said this is getting uncomfortable relative to size, and we're bringing it down. I don't think we've bought anything really in quite a long time in restaurants, and we've kind of put that on the list of not something we're considering. So, it's definitely our desire to bring it down and those numbers have been coming down now for a number of quarters. Relative to selling some properties, as we have been selling, a good number of those have been restaurants and so that's what's bringing down the percentage of the revenue in the portfolio. It's interesting also, Jeff, to look at it in restaurants, which is about 20%, 5% is Buffets, which coming out of their reorganization and with the adjustment of rents, we have pretty good cash flows on and kind of took a hit there, and that leaves us with about 15%. Out of that 15%, about half is fast food restaurants, and the fast food restaurant end has held up very well, as a matter of fact, has had some very good sales with people have been migrating down the price chart into restaurants and going for lower prices, they benefited. So if you take that out, that leaves us about 7% to 8% of casual dining. When we go through those, there has been a couple other little hits in there. So while there may be a little exposure, it's not up at 20% of the portfolio. I think it's down now to about 4% or 5% of the portfolio, where we look at it and say, “Okay, this is going to be a soft business, consumer's probably not coming back hard, and it is likely that spending will be moderated in the casual dining segment.” I think it's really down to about 4% or 5%, 6% that we keep an eye on now in restaurant.
Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo: I'm curious now as you're looking forward then 2 or 3 years and you talk about acquisitions coming back, are there segments or sectors that you'd like to see be more represented in your portfolio? If we're going to have a soft consumer market, has that caused you to think more about goods versus services or different geographies? How do you think about that mix?
Tom Lewis:  Yes. First on goods versus services, we're about 22% just pure services and about 55%, I think, that is goods that have some type of service with it and we like the service component. It seems to hold up a little better for us, and so there's a theme there. Outside of that, I think it's where two-thirds of the portfolio is already, which was kind of staying at the basic human needs which was stuff people buy every day and at relatively low price points, and that's served us pretty well. I think that this is a theme that we'll be playing out for quite a while and that means staying away from durable goods, kind of consumer discretionary. While I don't have specific industries, I think you just want to keep within that theme and as we're looking at things kind of come across, if it's restaurant, then we just move it right to the side and I'm not going to consider it today but anything outside of that we'll take a good look at, but basic human needs and low price point. The last point on it, if you look through the portfolio, while we don't have a lot of big box, small box has been easier to lease this year than the big box has been. So I think we'll continue to work in that space too.
Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo: I'm curious and normally I wouldn't ask this question of a retail landlord, but I think you guys pay particular attention to tenant credit. When you step back and look at what you see among the retailers and the service providers you have relationships with and what you hear from them, do you have a feel, Tom, I'm curious as to what, I guess I'll call it, what inning you think we're in? Do you think there is more pain, whether it's net store closures or bankruptcies, behind us than ahead of us? Or how do you think about that right now?
Tom Lewis: It's like in the 12-step program. I think it starts with first you have to admit you have a problem, and trying to see the future is not something that is really clear right now. I think you have to sit down and do some scenario planning which is you kind of say, okay, I think we'll slowly move up from here. The worst is over, and most of the retailers will be okay, but if it comes back too fast, you probably worry about the Fed tightening up a bit and a lot of people still have balance sheet as their primary problem and they'll have to refinance. So under that situation, while it'd be better, I think it'd just be okay. Kind of a middle scenario is what a lot of people are talking about, which is an L-shaped or (inaudible) and then you have to say, it's just going to go sideways for a while and people will be looking at their balance sheets and there still are maturities, so you've got some issues to look at right there. Then the other scenario, obviously, is we take another leg down, and then I think some people could have some problems. If we just go sideways, what we're hearing from our retailers is, generally, their business has stopped declining and generally they feel better about life, but I think you have to go a few years out and look at maturities on people's balance sheet. The other thing is, again, really scrubbing the portfolio. It's interesting because I had a research department four or five weeks ago through and run some numbers for me, and I said, go back and look at the first quarter of '09 retail sales versus first quarter '08, and what was it? The numbers they came back with was retail and food service total, kind of retail sales off 10.2% versus the year earlier. Then we looked at that and said, okay, take out autos and auto parts, because that has a big impact, and you got to about 6.9% the retail sales were down year-over-year. And then for fun, I said, okay, go get how much sales are down in the categories that we are in and weight it by how much of our portfolio it is and come out with a weighted that things are down. And that came out about 4.9% on average, but the categories that we're in, as our portfolio is weighted, were down in retail sales at the first quarter '08 versus first quarter '09 versus kind of 6.9% overall. As we went through then and looked at the numbers, the biggest component of downside there is convenience store sales were down about 35%. However, that's really unusual and their sales were down 35% but they were pretty much dramatically more profitable in that year than the previous year, and the reason was gas prices came down, and as most people know who follow convenience stores, when gas prices go up, margins get pinched and they struggle and when they come down, they widen out. So then we said, okay, back out convenience stores and rerun it, and it basically came out that retail sales in the categories that we were in which tend to be the low price point stuff were up about 1%. So as we look at things going forward, I think if you stay on the value retail side even if things move down here, you're going to be much better off than on the other. But the theme into the end to the longwinded answer is I still think you want to watch just as you do in REIT land and everywhere else, people's balance sheets and what their maturity schedule is down the way. For the moment, it looks pretty stable out there with the guys that we're talking to.
Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo: And just last question, I'll yield the floor, is as it relates to acquisitions, what do you think is causing folks or causing the market to become a little bit more liquid now and causing people to sell? Is it that you're seeing financing come back or folks under pressure to let assets go? You really haven't seen many transactions occur in other property types. It's starting, but given the cap rates that you're thrown out in the past, where you'd like to be a buyer, what's causing people to sell at those levels?
Tom Lewis: Yes. I think it's the same thing I just said before, which is most of it is balance sheet generated, where people have been sitting around for a year. They've had a big bid/ask spread. Now they're at the point where they have some financings coming up and really while credit's become a little more available, it hasn't gotten into a range where they think they can solve their problem, and they're saying, okay, I need to do something here, and as always, that's what closes the bid/ask spread. We live in Escondido and one of the areas is ground zero for decline in homes, and you saw at the end of 2006 it peaked, and then there were just no transactions for about a year to 18 months and then all of a sudden, people have to start selling, and the bid/ask spread closes. I think that's what's starting in our area. It could always be offset a bit if financing rates really came down. So there were some alternatives in the high-yield market and while that's gotten better, it hadn't gotten far enough for them. But I think it's just times gone by. Some people have some overall balance sheet issues they have to deal with, and now that the property is sitting on their portfolio, it's worthwhile for them to consider moving right up and getting them off the books.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citigroup.
Greg Schweitzer - Citigroup: Hi. It's Greg Schweitzer with Michael. On the increase in bad debt, could you talk a bit about the drivers of that increase?
Paul Meurer: Sure. We had a little bit larger number in the first quarter, you may recall me talking about, and then a little bit larger number the second quarter than expected. Those were receivables that were on the books that we chose to essentially write-off after what we do as sort of monthly review of those to determine whether they're collectible or not. There were a couple of big situations that made that a larger number year-to-date than we expect as a run rate going forward. One was one where we had a judgment where we thought we would collect a fair amount of the receivables from something that happened, say, a year ago or so, and that didn't come to fruition, as it turned out. So we’ve scrubbed them pretty hard to make sure that we're comfortable with what we believe to be the collectibility of all the receivables we have. One thing I'll point is our accounts receivable have not gone up. There's been no change in that. You can see that in our balance sheet. So we don't have a lot of those kind of sitting on the books. I mentioned in my upfront remarks that we expect the run rate to be less on a go-forward basis. Bad debt expense was $585,000 in the second quarter. Our current expectation is less than half of that for the next quarter and the quarter after that. So really that 585 may be for the balance of the year, if you will, is our current estimate. So we suspect we're going to continue to have some, more than we've had in years past, but that the bulk of it happened in the first half of this year.
Greg Schweitzer - Citigroup: And how do you get comfortable with sort of the tenant health for the retailers that report their sales to you annually? Is there any other ways that you monitor that health when you're looking at that receivables balance or as part of your watch list?
Tom Lewis: We do get their financials. More often that, it's the property-level stuff that we tend to get once a year on some of the tenants and we do get their financials. So we are able to watch their overall operations which then allows us to infer whether somebody is having a problem, but mostly what we do is pick up the phone and talk to them and have ongoing conversations. As Paul said, there's not huge receivables there. If there is a receivable from the tenant, then we'll tend to be on the phone with them a lot or if we've seen the trends go down or if the last time we were in cash flow coverages we thought that they were getting closer, there might be an issue. And, generally, we have really good discussions with the retailers. They're pretty open. We generally have confidentiality agreements with each other and good relationships. So we're able to keep on top of them casually; if not, within the lease, they're required to report every quarter.
Greg Schweitzer - Citigroup: How much of the portfolio as a percent of revenue, say, gives you that property-level detail only once a year?
Tom Lewis: I don't know off the top of my head. Of the whole portfolio, if you get to the top-15 tenants, it's probably 10 of them that we get it quarterly, and it's probably 3 or 4 annually and 1 or 2 that we get sales and impute backwards.
Greg Schweitzer - Citigroup: Okay. And then just a couple more on tenants. Vicorp filed for Chapter 11 last year and about three months ago it was sold to American Blue Ribbon and (inaudible) Bakers Squares with Realty Income as landlord. Were any of the locations that you have and are they under closure risk or are there any that you're monitoring?
Tom Lewis: We have none that are under closure risk or are monitoring. The Chapter 11 filing Vicorp pact was in April of last year, so that is a concluded event as of a number of quarters ago. So I don't think we have any exposure coming on Vicorp.
Greg Schweitzer - Citigroup: And then on the (inaudible) deal exposure, I know there was a question last quarter on it. A similar search comes up with the numerous (inaudible) locations with Realty Income as landlord. Are you able to give us the cash flow coverage of this tenant?
Tom Lewis: We, under no circumstances, comment on the cash flow coverage into the operations of companies in the portfolio unless they're in Chapter 11. So, no, we don't report their financials. We let them do it.
Greg Schweitzer - Citigroup: How about on an industry basis, say, for the auto, RV dealer industry cash flow coverage?
Tom Lewis: Yes. Well, we do have other tenants in there and that is the one that's on the lower end and this quarter improved from a 1.22 up into the 1.55 area.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets: There was some talk that there might be more Chapter 11 filings when DIP financing returned. Have you guys seen anything like that? Is that something you're hearing maybe a greater possibility for some of your tenants?
Tom Lewis: No. Right now, we have no tenants that we have in Chapter 11 in our top-25 tenants which gets down about 1% of rent, and we've had nobody call us up and say they're going to go or that we think is imminent. So dip financing has widened out a little bit, which has been actually good for those situations, but the answer is just no.
Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Then thinking about the spaces that you try to lease, the 79 that you have that are available to be leased, are those leasable spaces or are these things that you can actually get someone in there or do you think they're kind of terminal in a sense in that you're just not going to find a tenant in the near term?
Tom Lewis: Well, we don't think they're terminal. We've had a lot of leasing going on this year and we've been able to keep occupancy very high. And if you just look at the lease rollover list, we've had a number coming off there and then a number coming back from tenants, but thus far this year, our portfolio management group has been able to lease them as fast or faster as they come off. It has really been an advantage to have smaller boxes, and in the smaller boxes being able to find tenants that are regional if a national goes out or a local if a regional goes out that want to go in there and then the property sales that you've seen this year, a lot of the times are letting those people know that maybe an appropriate way for them to operate that property is to own it themselves so that we stay with most of our tenants being larger chains. So, no. They're not terminal. We have been able to lease them and I think the portfolio management group this year has done a great job and more than stayed even.
Paul Meurer: Yes, one of our trends, Rich, that we pointed out over the past two years has been while historically we used to say it takes about 6 months to release a vacant space, but that timeframe has widened a bit to 9 to 12 months. However, this past quarter, it went pretty fast on a handful of them. It was a nice little trend to have that be a little faster and that's why you saw that tick up in occupancy because we're always going to have a handful that are vacant, but as a general comment, over the past two years, it's taken a little bit longer to release space. Therefore, our carrying costs have gone up and, therefore, our property expenses went up a bit over the past year, but this past quarter, we actually saw a fair amount of momentum, which was nice.
Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Yes, Paul, you were heading in the same direction I was going to ask. I mean is that something we should extrapolate a bit? Do you think that's something that's a signal maybe the economy's improving a bit or the situation's getting better? Or was that maybe just a blip in the second quarter?
Paul Meurer: I don't know.
Tom Lewis: Is that a good answer?
Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Yes, that's fair. That's fair. I'm hopeful here and I was hoping maybe you guys were hopeful, as well. Then one more thing.
Paul Meurer: Rich, let me just say this. We have modeled it such that it is not going to continue to improve in that manner. How's that?
Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets: Yes, that's fair. That's conservative. I like that.
Paul Meurer: No, but that's important that we point out again that our projections include real conservative assumptions relative to the existing portfolio.
Rich Moore - RBC Capital Markets: And the last thing I had, guys, I know when you buy things, you tend to issue equity post the acquisition. With the markets as crazy as they are, when we have move-up in the equity markets, are you tempted to issue equity ahead of what might be some transactions? Is that a possibility, or you just wouldn't do that?
Tom Lewis: I would if I knew there were a number of transactions and they were about to close, which means I had accretive use for the funds on a fairly short-term basis. Absent that, we prefer to find things to buy before we go get a bunch of equity to buy it, and plus we're very lucky we have on cash on hand, but I'll give you the circumstances. We have $35 million here. If we went out and bought $35 million worth of stuff and it's a few months from now and we were sitting around and an opportunity comes in and it's $75 million or $100 million, as we got down very close to closing, where we've checked all the boxes and we're relatively sure it's going to close, under those circumstances, we would. Then depending on size, you have some disclosure risks relative to the acquisitions if it's just one. So I'd do it if the timing was fairly close, but if the timing wasn't close, we'd prefer to wait.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of [Ben Rosenshwank] with TFM.
Unidentified Analyst: This is actually [Ryan Levinson] sitting in with Ben. I was just wondering on the 9 properties sold in the second quarter how many were occupied?
Tom Lewis: 9 properties sold during the second quarter how many were occupied when they were sold? That's one of those questions where I'll give you two answers, and the first answer is I'm not exactly sure, but that's only because generally when we sell them and they're unoccupied, it is we have found somebody who would like to occupy them, and we make the choice rather than to sign a lease, to sell it to them. So it's technically unoccupied, but we do have somebody that wants it, and that's a function of when we find somebody who wants to lease it, deciding whether we'd like maintain them in the portfolio or not. There hadn't been a lot of sales of just vacant properties to somebody --
Gary Malino: I think most of them were occupied.
Tom Lewis: Yes.
Gary Malino: I'm just thinking through our vacancy list, Ryan, and where we're always analyzing for sale or lease, and I think only one of them was a vacant property being sold but not exactly sure.
Unidentified Analyst: At roughly $600,000 per property, I think it was about $5.5 million of gross proceeds, if I assume an average NOI per store, doesn't that equate to like a 20 something percent cap rate on each one of those locations if they were occupied?
Gary Malino: I can't do the math with you right now, but I am absolutely positive that wasn't the cap rate on our sales.
Unidentified Analyst: The other thing is Rite Aid announced that they're seeking rent relief on 500 stores in the second quarter. Of the 24 Rite Aids that are in your portfolio, do you have any exposure? It's obviously not their entire store base. It's just a fraction of their system. I'm just wondering if you have any exposure to that.
Tom Lewis: Yes, it's not our policy to comment on our individual tenants and what they're doing, so we can sit here all day. We have 118 tenants. A lot of times on these calls, people get mentioned who aren't our tenants, so that's the policy we'll maintain. We are not looking currently at any substantial downside in our drugstore portfolio and other areas and if there is some minor, we'd put it in the guidance but that's where we are there.
Unidentified Analyst: One other occupancy question. The two rejected leases in the Big 10 bankruptcy and the two rejected leases in the Bally's bankruptcy, I'm just wondering if those are included in the 79 vacant properties that you have?
Tom Lewis: Your information is incorrect.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. What's incorrect about it?
Tom Lewis: I'm not going to comment individually on tenants, which we don't, but it's not correct that I have those units that have been vacated or in a bankruptcy.
Unidentified Analyst: I'm sorry? On Bally's or Big, Big 10, there was a withdrawal of their rejection on Friday, and [Bear] wrote a note about this, which indicated that they had some sort of commentary from you.
Tom Lewis: On Big 10, I will comment. Big 10 went through a Chapter 11. They're out. We have 50 leases with them, 48 leases were accepted, which is exactly what we anticipated in the bankruptcy, and the other two we have and they're released out of the 79.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Those are in the 79. Can you give us an indication on what the rank concession was on the other 48?
Tom Lewis: It's very typical of what we reported in all the other ones. It's right around the mid-80s is what they come in at.
Unidentified Analyst: Mid-8?
Tom Lewis: Mid-80s, 84, 85, 86 generally when we go through a bankruptcy, and any of the ones that we've had in the last year, last 6 months have been relatively consistent with that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And so I take it then that you're saying that the Bally's information is incorrect?
Tom Lewis: Again, I'm not going to comment individually on all the tenants. We don't think we have exposure to any down side in rent in the health and fitness area right now.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. But there's a Bally Total Fitness of Greater New York, there's 7 stores that you're listed as landlord.
Tom Lewis: If you think we have some down side in that, I do not believe we do.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. So you're not debating whether you're the landlord; it's just --
Tom Lewis: I'm debating whether we think we have any down side in the tenant that you have mentioned.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, okay. One other one just about working capital; why does your working capital fluctuate so wildly from quarter-to-quarter, I think it was a provider of about roughly $25 million of cash in the quarter?
Paul Meurer: It doesn't vary widely from quarter-to-quarter. I'm not going to debate your math with you, but for example, we used $20 million of it in the first quarter to pay off the bonds that we had coming due then. More broadly speaking, when the bond payment dates are due, March 15 and September 15, and the cash gets used at those times to pay off those bonds when they're due.
Tom Lewis: And the quarter in between, it doesn't.
Paul Meurer: Right.
Unidentified Analyst: I'll follow up with you, Paul. Lastly, Tom, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were a couple of other hits. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit?
Tom Lewis: Nothing that I see coming right now, nothing going on that I know of in the top 25. So, no. Looking forward, there's nothing imminent right now that I'm aware of. Anything that has happened, we had in the guidance and we have a little extra put in there, but that's basically just an assumption something small will happen. So, nothing imminent that I'm aware of.
Unidentified Analyst: So you don't think that some of the LBOs where you were the financier of the real estate, (inaudible), nothing imminent there?
Tom Lewis: Not that I'm aware of.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew DiZio with Janney Montgomery Scott.
Andrew DiZio - Janney Montgomery Scott: First in relation to your expert lease expirations that are coming up in the second half of '09, are those centered around any particular industry, or, although you wouldn't give us a name, any particular tenant?
Tom Lewis: You know, we're kind of at the end of the child care era because we bought those about the same time. So a high number of our lease rollovers really for the last 4 or 5 years have come out of child care and there's some child care in there. And then I just think it was a smattering of a bunch of stuff. I think that's the only theme in there.
Andrew DiZio - Janney Montgomery Scott: Paul, I think you mentioned that your cost to carry had gone up in relation to the vacant properties. When you said that, did you mean on just an overall total basis because there's more vacancy, or did you mean like a per-square-foot basis? I think you mentioned before that your cost to carry is usually about 20%, $0.20 on the dollar?
Paul Meurer: Correct. I meant it in two different ways. One is that the carry time has increased a bit typically. Like I said, this past quarter, we had some real good success in terms of time, but for the most part over the last two years, let's call it, net time of vacancy has increased from about 6 months to more like 9 or 12 months in some of the properties. So the time of the carry, which increases the overall carry cost. That's the main cause of it, if you will. The second way is, yes, our vacancy, we've had a few more properties over the past two years, as opposed to the years just prior to that, and so as such, you're going to have a little bit higher carry cost.
Andrew DiZio - Janney Montgomery Scott: Sure, okay. So you just meant in the aggregate. Got you.
Paul Meurer: Correct.
Andrew DiZio - Janney Montgomery Scott: And last question. With respect to the narrowing of the bid/ask that you're seeing, are you seeing any particular industry that's adjusted faster, or is it just overall?
Paul Meurer: Again, I think it's balance sheet driven, so it really kind of comes across the board.
Operator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session. Mr. Lewis, please go ahead with any closing remarks.
Tom Lewis: Okay. Well, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us today, and hopefully, we'll talk again in about another 90 days and see what has unfolded during that period of time. Thank you very much.

===== 2009 Q1  (2009-04-30 16:30:00) =====
Executives:  Tom Lewis – CEO Paul Meuer – EVP & CFO Gary Malino – President & COO 
Analysts:  Michael Bilerman – Citi  David Fick – Stifel Nicolaus Jeffrey Donnelly – Wachovia Capital Markets [Todd Lucasik] – Morningstar  Ryan Levinson – Private Fund Management  
Presentation: 
Operator: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Realty Income first quarter earnings conference call. (Operator instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income; please go ahead, sir.
Tom Lewis: Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us late in the day. As always, in the room with me is Gary Malino, our President, and Chief Operating Officer; Paul Meuer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Pfeiffer, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, and Tere Miller, Vice President Corporate Communications. And as I’m obligated to say that during the call we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law. The company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements, and we will disclose in greater detail on the company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-K the factors that may cause such differences. Paul, why don’t we start with an overview of the numbers and then I’ll come back. 
Paul Meuer: Thanks Tom, as usual let me comment on our financial statement, just provide a few highlights of them as a result of the quarter. Starting with walking through the income statement total revenue increased 0.2% for the quarter. Rental revenue for the quarter was approximately $82.1 million. Same store rental revenue increased only 0.2% for the quarterly period, however excluding Buffets same store rent growth was healthier at 1.2% for the quarter reflecting the rest of our portfolio. Other income was $754,000 for the quarter. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $875,000 in the comparative quarterly period. Interest expense increased for the quarter to $21.4 million. This reduction reflects the retirement of the $120 million of our bonds which we have retired over the past few months.  We had zero borrowings on our credit facility throughout the entire quarter. On a related note, our interest coverage ratio increased to 3.5x, while our fixed charge coverage ratio increased to 2.7x. General and administrative, or G&A expenses in the first quarter were $5.95 million. This increase of about $400,000 from the same quarter last year was primarily the result of the immediate [inaudible] of some stock including shares held by our retiring chairman.  We expect G&A expenses in 2009 to remain similar to 2008 and only about 6.5% to 7% of total revenues or an estimate of about $23 million total for the year. Property expenses were $2.2 million in the quarter. These expenses are primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance, and insurance expenses which we are responsible for on properties available for lease. These expenses have increased a bit as we have a few more properties available for lease. In addition we did record additional bad debt expense in the first quarter of $700,000 which resulted from us being wrong about a few larger accrued receivables.  However we do not expect bad debt expense to be as high in future quarters. Our current estimate for property expenses for all of 2009, for the entire year, is about $6.8 million. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company and these taxes totaled $303,000 for the quarterly period.  Income from discontinued operations for the quarter totaled $37,000. Real estate acquired for resale of course refers to the operations of Crest Net Lease, our subsidiary that acquires and resells properties. Crest did not acquire or sell any properties in the first quarter however we did record further impairments on the Crest portfolio of $311,000 reflecting lower projected net sales proceeds.  A reminder that we have a very small remaining Crest portfolio, just five properties in there and held for sale. Real estate held for investment refers to property sales by [realty income] from existing core portfolio, we sold only one property during the first quarter resulting overall in income of $152,000.  And the usual reminder that we do not include these property sales gains out of the REIT in our funds from operations. Preferred stock cash dividends remained at $6.1 million for the quarter. Net income available to common stockholders was $24 million for the quarter and funds from operations or FFO was approximately $47 million for the quarter or $0.45 per share.  When we file our 10-Q we will again provide information you need to compute our adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO or the actual cash we have available for distribution as dividends and our AFFO or cash available for distribution is typically higher then our FFO as our capital expenditures are relatively low and we do not have a lot of straight line rent in the portfolio. We increased our monthly dividend again this quarter. We have increased the dividend 46 consecutive quarters and 53 times overall since we went public over 14.5 years ago. Our current monthly dividend is now $14.20625 per share which equates to the current annualized amount of $1.70475 per share.  Now let’s turn to the balance sheet for a moment, we have continued to maintain our conservative and safe capital structure. Our debt to total market capitalization today is about 34% and our preferred stock outstanding represents just 8.5% of our capital structure. All of these liabilities are fixed rate obligations.  We continue to have zero borrowing on our new $355 million credit facility. This facility also has a $100 million accordion expansion feature. The initial term of this facility runs until May, 2011 plus two one year extension options thereafter.  We have about $10 million cash on hand. A reminder, we retired the $20 million of bonds that matured in January so now our next debt maturity is not until 2013.  In summary we currently have excellent liquidity and our overall balance sheet remains healthy and safe. We have no exposure to variable rate debt, and we have no need to raise capital for any balance sheet maturities for the next four years.  Now let me turn the call back over to Tom and he’ll give you some more background on these results. 
Tom Lewis : Thanks Paul, I’ll start with the portfolio which I think is doing pretty well especially given the state of the world today. Obviously it continues to be tough out there in retail but quite frankly in the first quarter the deterioration we saw in the fourth was moderated and actually feel decently about pending things in the portfolio today. We don’t see a lot. With that said, our tenants operate in the same environment as everybody else. Its challenging out there and over the last six to eight months, we are very fortunate we feel to have dodged a lot of the bullets of retailers that have had problems. And in the few cases where we’ve had properties with them its been either just a few that we owned or we owned the more profitable properties they had which means we were able to keep them leased and keep the rent up.  I think the key for us as always is owning those profitable properties and having the high cash flow coverage of rent on a unit basis for the profitability of the units and that’s really where our margin of safety comes from.  As always if you look at our top 15 tenants, they accounted during the quarter for about 53.8% of revenue and the average cash flow coverage for those top 15 tenants, and I’ll kind of do this in sequence so its easier to do, in the third quarter the average cash flow coverage of rent on a unit basis was about 2.79x and ranged from 1.7 to 455.  At the end of the fourth quarter it was 2.4x which ranged from 122 to 375 and while that’s still pretty healthy you can see the erosion at the end of the quarter. At the end of the first quarter it was 239 and ranged again from 122 up into the high 3’s, so really not much movement. We have a couple of the tenants reporting annually so those wouldn’t go into the numbers.  But overall looking at all of the tenants there really wasn’t that much movement relative to the EBITDA and the cash flows that they had during the fourth quarter and our cash flow coverages remained fairly high through the first quarter.  And I think that’s why the portfolio has done better then some might have suspected and we still have existing a pretty good margin of safety on the portfolio. The quarter ended at 96.4% occupancy, 84 properties available for lease out of the 2,347. That’s down about 40 basis points from the previous quarter and I think we indicated on the fourth quarter call that we thought that would be coming and it was although it’s a little higher then we thought we’d end the quarter.  And really a function of getting some units back later in the quarter and just a little slower leasing activity because we got the units back later in the quarter, but still very healthy. Paul mentioned same store rents were up 0.2% and I’m pretty happy that we’re seeing positive same store rents given the environment out there so, any growth in existing rental flow is nice to see. During the first quarter if you look at kind of the net offset between same store increases, same store decline which in our case was increases, of the 30 retail industries in the portfolio there were seven that had declining same store rents. Restaurants were the vast majority of it and when you consider that just under half of our restaurant exposure is fast food, which is actually doing very well right now, the balance came really for the other 12% of the portfolio which is casual dining.  The other six that were down were very minor in nature so it really was mostly the Buffets as Paul mentioned. There were four industries that had flat same store rents, 19 had same store rent increased with the biggest increases really coming off automotive tire, convenience store, health and fitness, and the balance again were fairly small.  As we look across the portfolio what continues to work pretty well is basic goods and services that you buy on an ongoing basis, low price point kind of value and if you look at the portfolio, a little over two thirds of our revenue base is that type of retail and are all doing, for the most part, pretty good.  And I think the other reason that things have gone so well, if you look on the opposite side which is kind of durable good, apparel, high-end goods, consumer discretionary, or big box is a smaller part of the portfolio and that’s helped. Anyway, same store rents were up again in the quarter and which given by the way a 6% decline in GDP in the fourth quarter which you can really see the impact of, the 6% decline again in the first quarter that we had, we couldn’t see so much at least in our type of retail.  We continue to be diversified, we have 2,347 properties, 30 industries, 117 retailers in the portfolios and still in 49 states. That’s down in property count one from last quarter through the sale that Paul mentioned and relative to industry exposure, restaurant continues to be the largest at 21.6%. That’s down from about 23.7% a year ago and we think that will continue to fall, hopefully through acquiring other properties and not through rent reductions. Convenience stores are about 16.5%, they’re doing pretty well. Theaters at 9.1%, also doing well and then you get to childcare at 7.3% and the industries drop pretty quickly. So pretty good diversification of the industry.  Our largest tenant is just about, a little below 6% of rent, the next one is at 5% and then it drops pretty quickly from there and as I mentioned our top 10 tenants do about 40% of the revenue, top 15 about 54% and when you get to the 15th largest tenant, you’re down to only about 2% of our rent and it goes down fairly quickly.  The average lease term remains healthy at 11.8 years and that’s been primarily responsible lately because we haven’t been buying a lot of properties, and its mostly from releasing expiring leases at the end of their initial term.  We mentioned in the release that Buffets has emerged from reorganization, obviously coming out of that with a better balance sheet and we think adequate financing. They have a smaller number of units but profitable stores which we’re obviously very pleased about. And I would say that the resolution of the process ended up pretty much just where we thought it would when we first started talking about it a year ago. And if anybody would like some additional color on that, I can talk about it during the Q&A.  Overall then for the portfolio at 96.4% occupancy and same store rents still positive, it exhibits pretty good performance given where the world is. Relative to property acquisitions, again, we’ve remained inactive and that’s been intentional really since February of 2008. We don’t see much in the way of acquisitions in the second quarter and we continue to believe that anything we’d buy today probably we could buy a little cheaper at higher cap rates later.  So, why not wait. Also the liquidity that this has given us over the last year has also I think been beneficial relative to what the company looks like. But its really been thinking property prices would continue to go down and caps up which would be good for us.  I would think we may get a bit more acquisitive in the second half of the year. Cap rates are rising but transaction volume has really dropped pretty substantially. There aren’t a lot of transactions out in the marketplace and the quality of those transactions to date have been such that I think there were some of the marginal people coming out that really needed to raise capital.  My sense is that there’s pretty good [big debt] out spread out there. There are a lot of players that are waiting to see if rates get better, if the economy continues to improve and I think what will happen is cap rates will continue to rise.  One of the things, I mentioned this last quarter and I wanted to do it one more time to give a historical perspective on cap rates, if you look over the last four years the cap rates that we bought at were kind in the 8.4 to 8.7 range and I would say the one off transactions out in the marketplace were down in the 7’s and 8 caps and if you go back before that, its really just in 2003 and 2004 caps were up in the mid 9’s which is really where we see them today.  And previous to 2004 and you can go back pretty much from the time that we came into business in 1969, caps really ran from the mid 10’s up into the 11’s. So I think that most of the 7 and 8 caps, maybe even the 9 caps that you’ve seen in the last few years like on a lot of assets, were really rates that are a function of historically cheap financing and we think cap rates continuing to move back up is probably what we’re looking at.  But they’re kind of in the mid 9’s today and my sense is we’re starting to see some more opportunities so maybe in the second half buying a few more properties. Relative to dividends, as you all know, that’s our priority here at the company. We will pay the dividend in cash, it makes it easier for our 70,000 plus shareholders who tell us they pay their bills with it, to pay their bills.  And we would anticipate that the dividend would be higher this year then last year and hopefully that’s what it will be next year also. That’s why we are here every day. Paul mentioned the balance sheet and paying off the $120 million of debt that was coming due which leaves us nothing due until 2013 and again no balance on the line. Cash on hand, we’re producing excess cash and obviously no mortgages or developments or JV or anything off balance sheet, so its pretty simple and the balance sheet is in great shape.  Relative to the guidance, we tweaked it again this quarter just to top side to 183 to 187. That’s flat to 2.2% FFO growth and the previous estimate that we had was based on zero to $375 million in acquisitions and we took $125 million off that given we didn’t think we’d buy anything in the second quarter so the range really anticipates anywhere from zero acquisitions up to $250 million.  And for our modeling purpose we really put in the second half of the year that if we do the $125 million we put it at the end of the third quarter and the other $125 million at the end of the fourth for modeling purposes to try and stay conservative on that.  Relative to the portfolio and what we see there in the guidance, we have built in anything we [can’t] see coming as of now, as well as an assumption of a few other things down the road but we don’t know what that would be. As I mentioned earlier I think where we sit today to give you a feel versus looking at the portfolio a quarter ago, we actually feel a bit more positive about it because we think the retailers have not seen the deterioration that they saw in the fourth quarter and they’re feeling a little bit better. Although I really use that as a current basis comment and not a project of the future. To summarize then, portfolio is in good shape, positive same store rent growth, good occupancy, balance sheet is in great shape, and we think there may be some opportunities to buy in the second half of the year.  I’ll mention that the best email I got for the week was someone who sent me a picture of a guy slumped over at his desk asleep with a note that said, I saw your earnings release, which I thought was funny but as I said at the start, it was pretty much a quiet quarter and with that, I think we’ll keep with shorter comments this time, and we’ll now take some questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman – Citi 
Michael Bilerman – Citi : Could you tell us a bit more about the drivers of the occupancy decline, specifically which tenants gave their units back that you weren’t expecting. 
Tom Lewis: Let’s see, it was pretty much broad based, I think about 13, 14 of the 21 were really just lease rollover which is the normal activity of anywhere from 2% to 4% of the leases that come off at the end of the year. And then the rest were really kind of one-offs, there’s no grouping by a big tenant. There are 119 tenants we count, those are multiple units, and then there’s a lot of others that are just one-offs. There was no grouping I think in the fourth quarter. It was pretty much spread around. 
Michael Bilerman – Citi : Was there any grouping for the reason for the increase in the bad debt expense. 
Paul Meuer : The bad debt expense was really driven by one specific situation on a relatively smaller tenant, so not a big number that was in reorganization and we had put in place accounts receivable for some rent then and we misjudged it. So it wasn’t an accounting error it was a judgment error in terms of collectability of that specific rent receivable.  When that reorganization reached its conclusion then we actually had to reverse that out and charge that as bad debt expense. I should tell you that as part of that, and it’s a process we do every quarter, we go through all of our receivables every quarter, kind of scrub them, think them through in terms of what their collectability and in particular look at any situations like that where you may have a tenant in sort of distress or what have you.  And we don’t have any other issues or lack of confidence relative to the remainder at this time of our accounts receivable. So it was kind of a unique situation, there was a grouping in that, and it was a large charge associated with one tenant where there was a handful of months aggregated together in that accounts receivable balance. 
Michael Bilerman – Citi : How prevalent are rent relief requests from tenants these days. 
Tom Lewis :  I would say in the last month or so I haven’t heard as much about it, but it was very prevalent towards the end of the fourth quarter and its interesting because I think what happened is there were a few, actually a lot of Chapter 11 in retail, not for us, but generically last year and we keep a chart of them and it was a big number, and as part of those everybody who goes into a Chapter 11 in retail hires the same three or four firms to go and get rent relief. And they’ll go to the mall owners or whoever it is that’s their landlord and say, gee things are tough and we’re going to have to renegotiate some rent. And what typically happens if you’re a larger landlord you’re aware of how your units are doing, or what the profitability is and your reaction is, we own your more profitable units, there aren’t going to be rent reductions.  However what did work last year for a lot of retailers was going back and if they had some one-off owners of buildings, particularly when they had mortgage financing on it and saying, look we may have a problem here if you can’t cut rent. If they could get some knowledge of what the one-off owners’ payments were, I think there was some success in getting that person to do a rent reduction.  And so just like REIT industry when a couple of people do something and you go to an AREIT meeting and everybody hears about it on a panel, I think in retail last year everybody went to the retail conferences and three guys from these companies that try and get rent reductions got up on a panel and then we got a whole bunch of phone calls and basically said, our units are profitable the answer is no.  So I think that was a trend but it was really a trend towards the end of the last year and it really moderated coming into the first quarter. 
Michael Bilerman – Citi : And have you granted any concessions.
Tom Lewis : Not much, not that I can think of. One here, two there, nothing big, no. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Fick – Stifel Nicolaus
David Fick – Stifel Nicolaus: I had a chance to go through your beautiful glossy Annual Report the other day and its always one of the most interesting reports in our industry, you try to make it humorous and you had two facing pages that show the old business plan and the new business plan sort of delineated and there’s virtually no changes in the words from the old plan to the new plan. However I would point out that there’s no reference in there to acquisition strategy and you’ve already referenced that you might do some acquisitions later this year. Just sort of wondering given your view and we think we agree with it that there is a continued shift in cap rates, where will you be comfortable number one, and number two what is going to give you confidence that you will not continue to see a loss in value for anything you buy later this year.  
Tom Lewis : Yes, a very good question a very good comment. As long as we think that prices will decline and cap rates are up, yes it is good to step back and that’s why we’re doing it. My sense at some point is barring your call generally on the economy is when cap rates get up into the 10, 10 plus range they’re likely to become a bit more stable.  Now its always hard to call the future. Maybe they could get to 11 but looking back historically throughout our history, getting up over 11 happens occasionally but that’s kind of where things have stopped and so if we can get up into the 10’s I think I might have some confidence that there wouldn’t be a huge amount of erosion above that.  But I would also really say that part of not buying today is two other things, one is its just looking at your cost of capital. If you look at debt or preferred out there today in the market I don’t think you can find a way to issue either one and make it accretive on an upfront basis to go out and buy properties and we really need 100 to 140, 150 basis points spread up front before you want to take on the risk of an acquisition and lock that in up front.  And so you really have to start looking at equity and if you start looking at equity and its pricing, I think today we closed around 23.5, I think if you took the midline which is about 185 and you divided that by the price of the stock you’d end up somewhere in about the 8 2 range, and if you gross that out for offering costs, if you divided it by about 0.95, you’d probably end up around 8 6 as kind of a nominal cost of equity.  And so you’re really looking at 10 at 140 basis points spread before its going to be accretive to buy something and I think that’s really kind of where you want to be out there today before you start considering it. We’ve done 14 equity offerings since we went public and each one we like to look at and say, look there was good accretive spread above that and we’d really want that situation and I also think today, where we used to go out and put $100, $150 million on the line, and then assume the financing would be there, that’s probably not a good idea and you want to be able to fund with equity on a current basis.  So it would be having a couple of transactions that were big enough closing at the right time with a cost of equity you’ve got some confidence in and a spread that was big enough. But the third thing which is of the transactions that have been coming through which the volume has really been lighter to date, the credit quality has been such that we just couldn’t get there on a comfort basis.  It seems to be the people that have been coming out are those that really have a problem right now. What’s surprising to me could continue, but at some point knowing when debt maturities for various companies are and where credit spreads are currently, I think at some point there are people who are just continuing to wait and say, gee I hope things get better by the fall when I’ve got some debt coming due.  So our best guess right now is modally acquisitive maybe in the third quarter and then in the fourth quarter some of the better stuff coming out and then it will all be on spreads. But that’s using your crystal ball which is always a little murky. 
David Fick – Stifel Nicolaus: The Buffets question last year when everybody got caught by surprise on that bankruptcy, you declined to make any comments and it sounds like you’re a little bit more willing to discuss both the accountability question you had at the time and sort of the way this thing played out and where you ended up in terms of old versus new rent. 
Tom Lewis : I’ll kind of run through it, I think most people are familiar with it but if not they did their 11, went into 11 15 months ago. It was our largest tenant, it was about a little over 7% of rent, and obviously they’ve now completed the process, have a better balance sheet, new financing and they’re out and operating with a smaller group of stores. We were on the creditors committee throughout it so worked very closely with it and I do think its instructive. When we originally did the transaction it was back in November of 2006 and it was Hometown Buffet which is a buffet chain out of Minnesota, that had a footprint that kind of went the northern part of the country out to here and then one in the southeast which was Ryan, and Hometown Buffet bought Ryan.  Together they had 672 restaurants, Hometown Buffet paid about $870 million for the company and financed it really through a recap of the whole organization so kind of the recap doesn’t equal the purchase price. But the financing was unsecured bonds or debt of about $300 million. It was secured bank debt of about $530 million which was some old rolling and some new. There was a sale-leaseback on a lot of the property that the company owned, that was $566 million of which we were involved in about $350 million of for 146 properties.  We took 30 of those for sale and [inaudible] and just have a couple left so those were sold and that left us really at the time of filing with 116 properties that we had paid $285 million for and they merged the two companies, took the footprint down to about 625 stores and the company then had about a $169 million of EBITDA, so there was a lot of cash flow behind it all and essentially then, I really think that you’ve got a tsunami, kind of a perfect storm at least from our vantage point of having looked at a whole lot of these. Pretty quickly the top line got hit much quicker then other retailers got hit really from increasing gas prices and if you look at the consumer that Buffets had, a lot of these are Wal-Mart and Lowe’s out pads and I think those consumers were kind of the poster child for the people that got hit and the consumer spending in that group dropped off and it hit their top line. At the same time, although we don’t kind of remember it now that we’re into 2009 and 2007 the middle line really got hit with higher food prices and the food costs really got out of control and at the same time that the top line really suffered by a lot and the middle line got hit they were going through their integration and I think it would be kind to say that the integration did not go as well as they thought it would from a management standpoint.  So you ended up with kind of the holy trinity of the top line, middle line and integration and in the long and short and we’re familiar with restaurant, we’ve been in it since 1969, and this type of operation. It is the biggest meltdown of EBITDA that we’ve seen in a relatively short period of time. EBITDA starting out when they did the merger was about $169 million, and the EBITDA by the time of filing which was about 15 months later was about $98 million so EBITDA dropped about 42% which obviously for a levered company is not good and really is an extraordinary drop.  So they went in and they filed for reorganization, that was last January and its 15 months later and kind of if you look at the resolution, I think its interesting relative to the parties involved and what happened its indicative of kind of how these work and again, this one was with a top line, middle line, bottom line.  The equity essentially that had been placed into the company which was a combination of the equity from the original purchase of Hometown Buffet was basically wiped out and there was no recovery which is pretty typical of these. The unsecured bondholders which had put up about $300 million ended up at the end with about 4.5% of the new equity in the private company which is worth about $5 million so the $300 million of unsecured bondholders recovered about 1.7% of their capital.  The secured bank debt of which there was originally $530 million that had grown by filing to about $580 million with original draws, and it’s a bit convoluted, but if you work through it the bank debt got about 94% of the new equity in the company that is worth about $111 million. They also rolled $140 million of their prefiling debt forward that is on the books today.  And if you put those together that’s about $251 million so for the secured bank debt its about a 43% recovery. Relative to our position and I don’t know the other landlords or won’t comment on them, we had 116 properties at the time of filing that we had paid $285 million for. We still own all 116 properties so we are not trying to recover any principal. We still own all of them. Twelve we got back when they filed, four of those have been leased and the other eight are out for lease.  So as we sit here, we also had 104 properties accepted and are under lease today and the rent that we negotiated was about 87.9% of prefiling rent. And we also were able to put into some of the leases a provision of sales go back up so we could recapture part of that. So kind of the net, net problem, I know that they’re EBITDA, they right sized during the filing process and it brought store count and EBITDA down a bit.  But as they come out today the equity has no recovery, the unsecured bondholders about 1.7, the secured bank debt about 43% and then we have obviously all of our assets and about 86%, 87% of rent, somewhere in that ballpark and we’ll see what the future holds in terms of recapturing that.  I think its kind of interesting to view this because in a company that even though it has had a significant decline in EBITDA that has a lot of EBITDA, you can see what happens to kind of the unsecured debt, the secured debt, and then the landlord relative to their position but that is really predicated on the landlord owing the profitable properties and if you do, you generally do pretty good or okay at least.  We ended up pretty much the way we thought it would work out. They’re out now doing pretty well, have some good flexibility. I know for us, I went back and checked the numbers today, and this was the 22nd reorganization that we have done in the last 12 years and if you take those in that 12 year period at the time each one hit and take their percentage of rent and you add it up, it was about 33% of our rent and we really view it while not fun part of the business and we try and underwrite for it, and if you look at it the recapture of rent on the 22 is about 90%.  As we look back and we’ve done probably 15 postmortems in the underwriting here, and we sat around for about six months saying, I don’t think we’d underwrite this at all differently and I think today the two comments we’ve come up with is size, when you get up to about 7% of rents, then that’s getting a little uncomfortable. So we’d like it to be smaller.  The second one out of this and I’ll just comment very briefly is in going through it when we calculate cash flow coverages and look at what we’re doing, we probably have a little greater sensitivity in the underwritings today relative to trying to do an allocation that’s appropriate. Corporate overhead on top of that to the EBIDAR down on the unit basis but that’s a really interesting event that we’ve learned a lot about.  But outside of that its hard to not look at it and say, we wouldn’t underwrite something like this today. That’s essentially what we do for a living. 
David Fick – Stifel Nicolaus: I think Paul said that your minimum rent coverage now is 1.7, is that across the board. I assume you must have units that are below that. Is that at the corporate level and would that be for Buffets or can you tell us where Buffets stands there.
Tom Lewis : Yes, Buffets is higher then that and I don’t want to go much more then that because as we reduce the rent, one of the things that you want to do is make sure that they have some room to operate those properties properly coming out just as you do as you write that data unsecured, secured or whatever.  For the portfolio it runs 1 2 2, up into the high 3’s. If we were looking at underwriting a transaction today, generally in the past we wanted to be north of 2 and its really industry specific, closer to 2.5 with a minimum maybe on a few units in a transaction down towards 1.5. I would say the other lesson out of that which I should have brought up, at least in light of where the economy is today, and maybe permanently is we probably want to be up closer into the mid to high 2’s generally and the left side of the bell curve kind of at a minimum of 1 7 5.  But is really industry specific because everybody’s got different operating margins. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Donnelly – Wachovia Capital Markets 
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wachovia Capital Markets:  A follow-up to that, what percentage of your retailers or your leases are operating say below one, one or one, two coverage.
Tom Lewis : I don’t know out of the 2,358 but I would say there’s a very small number under the 1 0. When I get to the 1 2 you’re really dropping down big for one particular tenant and one particular industry and there’s a smattering throughout the portfolio, but I really don’t think it’s a big number.  As we’ve gone back and looked through the tenants and getting through the top 25, there’s always going to be one or two with a tenant that something happens in an area, but I don’t think it’s a very large number.
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wachovia Capital Markets: I think one of your tenants, and I’m positive you addressed this earlier, I think it’s the Big Ten Tires recently filed, what’s your exposure there and I guess what do you see as the outcome of their issues. 
Tom Lewis : Big Ten is in 11, its only about a little over 2% of rents for us. We have 50 properties with them, two were rejected when they did the bankruptcy. This will all sound familiar to you, there’s a fairly leveraged transaction from a balance sheet standpoint and we think the primary issue for them is debt and we believe generally they’re profitable properties and assets will do pretty well.  And I think we have a good handle on the operations of their units. By the way we did build that kind of seen it coming and its small into the guidance that we did last quarter and its in this quarter’s guidance. And beyond that once again and again this will sound familiar, we are again on the creditors committee, in fact I think in this one we’re chairing it and as such under confidentiality agreement we’ll work through it and I think it will look like most of the others that this is for us.  But given the size of the tenant to us, I don’t think its meaningful. I guess the other thing to say in our top 25 which gets you down to about 1% of rent, this is the only tenant in that situation and I know I’ve been asked a couple of times and we demure on tenant names, are you in this one, this one, this one, but when you do our top 25 and it gets down to 1% of rent, this is the only tenant in that situation and we’ll watch it transpire. 
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wachovia Capital Markets:  Have you added or removed any retailers from your guidance that you now gave most recently because of threats that you think have gone away or threats that are on the landscape. 
Paul Meuer : Its exactly what it was three months ago. 
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wachovia Capital Markets: On the tenant side at least, do you have any details on the percentage of your revenues that are exposed to I guess I’ll call it private equity or LBO type situations like you saw with Buffets and some of these other companies. Because there’s certainly a lot of activity with the other retail REITs, probably 5% to 6% of their revenues out there are in the hands of groups like fund capital and some of the other firms that have seen a lot of bankruptcies of late. 
Tom Lewis : Yes, I think that would be the case for us. We’ve obviously dodged a huge amount of it but we did a lot of private equity but we really underwrote it understanding where that balance sheet sat at the time we did it and what the properties needed to have for cash flow coverage. I have not done a calculation for private equity but there’s a fair amount of it in there like everybody else. 
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wachovia Capital Markets: Many of your peers are out there in the REIT space are raising capital some at prices which are I guess attractive versus, or vis-a-vie their NAV, what’s your thought on accessing the equity markets at this point to perhaps build up some dry powder in anticipation of either retailers needing some capital or maybe some of these private equity firms who are looking to restructure ownership of their store base. 
Paul Meuer : I can’t comment in general on the industry, I can only comment on the situation we’re in which is our balance sheet is in great shape, we have low leverage, cash on hand, a new line we put in place a year ago that runs for a couple more years and has no borrowings on it. So we have liquidity and don’t have any need to refinance and in particular no debt maturing until 2013 and even then, its only $100 million. We’ve got nothing in 2014 and only $150 million in 2015. So we don’t have any near-term issues call it for the next six years let’s call it. So it really would be dependent upon acquisitions. In general the way I answer your question is we tend to think of equity issuance as something that we view as needing to be accretive when we do it in terms of adding to the bottom line, growing our earnings and then also allowing us to grow the dividends of the company and pay steady and increasing dividends over time which has always been what our mission is.  So it really will go back to what Tom described earlier is the acquisition environment, cap rates, are they at numbers that are accretive relative to the stock price, and where our equity cost of capital is and kind of what Tom was describing earlier. And is it something we can pursue in an accretive manner and perhaps that’s a thought that hasn’t been talked about in a while. But that’s still how we continue to view equity capital and our need to access the capital market. 
Tom Lewis : If you’re going to take any dilution it better be for a month or two or three or four. I mean if you’re, unless you need capital for a balance sheet issue and that I understand, but I think the history of capital allocation of raising a bunch of money and then doing something that’s not accretive in the hope that it comes accretive, its tough to handle. And in that lease business, its just damned impossible because you’ve got to be contracting for it and get your spread up front and I don’t have the visibility right relative to a transaction where we do that. If all of a sudden I knew there was $200 million that we thought we were getting very close on or $100 million and it would be very accretive to where the stock was today and I thought I was closing in 30 days and I was certain of it, or 60 days, then I’d start talking. But to build a war chest for something that may come down and take $0.20, $0.30 out today, when you put that war chest to work as I run the numbers you’re only going to get the $0.20, $0.30 anyway so it becomes hard to do. Now I recognize our property type is maybe different and there are other people who could buy very cheap and the rents will go up but I don’t really think its our game so I think we’d have to have a lot of visibility coming up pretty close on a transaction we know would be accretive to issue much in the way of equity. 
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wachovia Capital Markets: Well thanks for the refresher and you could have just said no too. 
Tom Lewis: Gary do you have an answer?
Gary Malino : No, I think you covered it. 
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wachovia Capital Markets: Actually one last question and I know its kind of minute but I guess I haven’t asked about it in a while is Silverton and I’m asking only because it’s a facility that, I know its just one asset that’s fairly large and my recollection—
Gary Malino : The asset manager job is available there if you’d like—
Jeffrey Donnelly – Wachovia Capital Markets:  No thank you, I think it would be very intensive. I’m asking because there are a lot of, my recollection is there’s a lot of tenants at that property who are more, I’ll call it small business or mom and pop oriented, have you seen a lot of turnover or loss there that’s of note.
Tom Lewis : You know, it’s a funny property. Let me give some people some history. We own one light industrial 400,000 square foot incubator space type industrial property in North County, San Diego right next to Miramar Air Base, which for those of you from around the country is where they filmed Top Gun.  And it is something that we bought 20 plus years ago that blew up in our faces and after much debate we kept it and got back everything that we lost on it and then rents when through the roof and a couple three years ago has a very active debate within our committee here, should we sell it, its unusual for what we own and it usually comes up, its in our backyard, its perfectly placed and so occupancy was running what 95, 96 and today we’re at about 90% so there’s been a little bit, you know San Diego pretty well because you were here and that Miramar market is very, very, its tight, there’s not a lot of room to build. So you have seen a little bit but not a great amount but again its not a huge amount of property for us.  
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of [Todd Lucasik] – Morningstar  
[Todd Lucasik] – Morningstar :  Just a question with regards to acquisition finance facility, if you do do the $250 million by the end of the year is that debt that you can hold onto that facility through 2013 with two extensions or does it have to be taken out earlier. 
Paul Meuer : If we wanted to we could hold it as a balance on that facility for the length of the facility. That would not be our approach. As Tom mentioned earlier we really wouldn’t want to assume a nice spread off of the cost of the facility and kind of carry that variable rate debt and that really hasn’t been our approach historically.  I think historically if our balance in our facility got to $100, $150 we would do something. Today that trigger might even be smaller then that, south of $100 million, or we’d want to take it out with permanent capital and in our case, as we’ve described, we’re thinking about that as equity permanent capital. 
Tom Lewis : But if we were about to raise equity and we were about to close and we were very comfortable we’d probably put it on the line for a short period of time and then go ahead and issue equity and Mr. Donnelly who was on right before you put a spell on us and went down, yes, our backup would be to have a capacity to hold it for a while. 
[Todd Lucasik] – Morningstar : This might be another yes no question, or at least potentially one, is there, if you were considering debt, is there a spread between, would you ever consider secured debt. Is there a spread between secured financing and unsecured debt at which you might consider mortgages on properties. 
Tom Lewis : We’ve been here for 40 years and have never had a mortgage on a property. So that’s a lot, however we’ve always viewed and never really had this talk about it, I think I’ll talk about it for the first time now, one of the reasons we use unsecured debt and do long-term fixed rate debt and keep debt fairly low on the balance sheet is that we have a very conservative investor, most of who are retired and can’t take a huge amount of risk relative to the balance sheet. And one of the reasons to become fully unencumbered is if you got into a period of time when the unsecured market was not available for long period of time obviously you could go out on a very large portfolio and on a very low, low, a low to value ratio you secure debt as your emergency shoot in the event the markets were closed. We do not anticipate doing that because we don’t have near-term maturity but that’s always been the reason to keep it unencumbered and it really speaks back to who the investor base is.  I think you always have to have that reserve shoot if you’ve got 70,000 shareholders who are retired. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Levinson – Private Fund Management  
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund Management :  On the same store rents by my calculation Buffets was down about 15% year over year, I’m just wondering if that’s the kind of the expectation that we should have on sort of your more stressed retailers, if they come in for getting some sort of concession. 
Tom Lewis : If they’re Chapter 11 I think that’s, its not a bad number to use but I would say that its really tenant specific. And I would say again what I said about Buffets, that’s the worst meltdown in EBITDA in 11 I’ve ever seen. So we did underwrite it well. I think generically we have but that was a pretty big one. 
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund Management : What are the lease spreads coming in on some of the leases, that are coming up for renewal naturally. 
Tom Lewis : Generally lease renewal right now is about flat and it has been up slightly for the last two, three years. Lease spreads when you’re speaking about net lease is a different business then I think a shopping center where you’re really leasing open space, so a lot of net lease properties are very tenant specific. They tend to either release the property if its profitable to them or they don’t if it is not.  If it is then generally in most of the leases there’s a bump that works anywhere from 3% to 5% and that’s a function of just being some extensions on top of a 15 to 20 year base lease. If they walk away generally its because it was unprofitable to them. It is a weaker unit and in that case your lease spread goes negative. That’s been the history.  If you look at lease turning over this year, its fairly small. The vast majority of it are properties that have rolled over before where a tenant had it for 20 years or 15 years and then we signed a new five year lease because it was profitable to the tenant and its rolling over again. So the vast majority of our leases rolling over this year are secondary leases which should be profitable but given the economy we’re guessing a ballpark flat. 
Paul Meuer : I would add one thing to that, which is that our annual historic experience with rollover has been that about two thirds of the leases that roll over get accepted by the existing tenant which as Tom described becomes a positive rent event typically.  That hasn’t changed. So that experience relative to about two thirds of them being released to the same tenant, so that’s been a good trend to watch and then on top of that as Tom described, to the extent that when you look at our expiration schedule and the subsequent expirations, we expect those subsequent ones to be more likely to re up themselves because they’ve already made that decision once on that existing space. 
Tom Lewis : Answer to the question, flat. 
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund Management : That was actually my next question, was that in the first quarter it looks like if I assume that of the 148 leases that you had expiring this year if I assume that that’s spread evenly over the year it looks like about two thirds renewed, is that what we should expect for the remainder of the year as well. 
Tom Lewis : I think it will be higher this year and I think that’s a function if you look at the table in the back of the press release that a high percentage of the rollovers this year are secondary or subsequent expirations. 
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund Management : In any event though, it looks like that adds close to 200 basis points of vacancy to the portfolio.
Tom Lewis : I don’t—
Paul Meuer : I know that’s not what we’re projecting—
Tom Lewis : Maybe offline you can share the math with us because we, I’m not sure we’d get there. We also on the ones that don’t roll over we release them. 
Paul Meuer : And we plan that a year ahead of time. This isn’t like moment in time tenant tells us that day, stay or go. We’ve had dialogue leading up six to 12 months beforehand about what their plans are. Its usually not one-off, it might be somebody who has eight, 10, 12 at that particular time so we have a sense, a plan in place, we’re already working on releasing, selling a property, that sort of thing. It’s a little bit more active then that. Its not like it goes blank that day and then we’ve got to struggle to figure out what to do with it. 
Tom Lewis : In the portfolio management department we’re pretty close with the tenants so we’ll start anywhere from a year and a half to two years out from the point of rollover talking to the tenant. We know how profitable the unit is so we can pretty much without calling them get a decent idea of which ones are going to keep and just move those aside.  And on the ones we think that are in question, we’re in well over a year ahead of time and on the ones that they’re going to give back, we usually know it six months, eight months ahead of time so it tends not to turn into a lot of incremental vacancy.
Paul Meuer : Plus we’re releasing the existing stuff that is vacant so properties are coming off of that list as well. 
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund Management : The EBIDAR to rent ratio, you said that some of the tenants only disclose their financials annually, I was just wondering if the RV dealer, Camping World, that’s at that 1.22x at the low end, if they are one of the ones that only discloses annually. I was just surprised to see that 1.22 didn’t move. 
Tom Lewis : We do not discuss the individual business of tenants so I wouldn’t comment to that. 
Paul Meuer : And we never referred to them as that tenant. I want to be specific on that. 
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund Management : But you said it was an auto dealer.
Tom Lewis : I said a dealer. 
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund Management : I thought I heard that you said it was an auto dealer. 
Tom Lewis : If I did, I misspoke.  
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments. 
Paul Meuer : Thank you all very much, I know on the east coast its getting late and there its busy with a lot of calls and we really appreciate it and thank you. Have a good day.

===== 2008 Q4  (2009-02-12 16:30:00) =====
Executives: Tom Lewis – Vice Chairman and CEO Paul Meurer – EVP, CFO and Treasurer Gary Malino – President and COO

Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so for much for standing by and welcome to the Realty Income Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today on Thursday, February 12, 2009. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.
Tom Lewis: Thank you very much, Michael and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our review of operations and results for the fourth quarter and 2008 overall. In the room with me today is Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Mike Pfeiffer, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel. And as always, during this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law. The company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements, and we will disclose in greater detail on the company’s quarterly and on Form 10-K the factors that may cause such differences. Anyway, as we normally do, we will have Paul start with a review of the numbers and then we will come back trying to give some color for what went on in the fourth quarter. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Tom. As usual, let me comment on the financial statements, and provide some highlights of those financial results for the quarter, and starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 3.2% for the quarter and 12.2% for the year. Rental revenue for the quarter was approximately $82.6 million for an annualized run rate now of about $331 million. Same-store rental revenue increased only 0.4% for the quarterly period. However, excluding Buffets, same-store rental growth was healthier at 1.5% for the quarter. Other income was only $83,000 for the quarter. On the expense side, interest expense remained flat for the quarter at around $22.7 million. We had zero borrowings on our credit facility throughout the entire year of 2008. On a related note, our interest coverage ratio finished the year strong at 3.2 times, while our fixed-charge coverage ratio was 2.6 times. Our coverage ratios will likely be even stronger in 2009 because of the recent retirement of the $120 million of bond which we paid off in the past two months. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by just under $2 million in the comparative quarterly period, as depreciation expense naturally has increased as the portfolio has grown over time. General and administrative expenses, or G&A, expenses for the fourth quarter were under $5.1 million, a reduction of over $400,000 from last year. For the year, G&A was down about $1.1 million. G&A represented only 6.1% of total revenues for the quarter and 6.5% for the year. We expect G&A expenses in 2009 to remain at only about 6.5% to 7% maximum of total revenues. Property expenses increased by $855,000 for the quarter and by $2.3 million for the year. These expenses are primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance, and insurance expenses, which we are responsible for on properties available for lease. We expect property expenses to increase again a little bit in 2009, and our current estimate for 2009 is about $6.3 million. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company, and these taxes totaled $307,000 for the quarterly period. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter was $4.3 million. Real estate acquired for resale refers to the operations of Crest Net Lease, our subsidiary that acquires and resells properties. Crest however did not acquire or sell any properties in the fourth quarter. Real estate held for investment refers to property sales by Realty Income from our existing core portfolio. We sold seven properties during the fourth quarter, resulting overall in income of $4.3 million. And a reminder, once again, these property sale gains are not included in our funds from operations. Preferred stock cash dividends remained at $6.1 million for the quarter, and net income available to common stockholders was $28.3 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO, was approximately $47 million for the quarter. FFO per share was $0.46 per share for the quarter and $1.83 for the year. FFO before Crest contribution or the FFO from our core portfolio actually increased in 2008 by 2.2% to $1.82 from $1.78 in 2007. When we file our 10-K, we will again provide information you need to compute adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or the actual cash available for distribution as dividend. Our AFFO, or cash available for distribution is typically higher than our FFO, and it was once again in 2008, as our capital expenditures remain relatively low, and we don’t have a lot of straight-line rent in the portfolio. Our continued growth in core earnings allowed us to increase our monthly dividend again this quarter. We have increased the dividend 45 consecutive quarters and 52 times overall since we went public over 14 years ago. Our current monthly dividend is now $0.14175 per share, which equates to the current annualized amount of $1.701 per share. Now let us turn to the balance sheet for a moment. We have continued to enhance our conservative and very safe capital structure. Our debt-to-total market cap is 33%, and our preferred stock outstanding represents just 8% of our capital structure. All of these liabilities are of course fixed-rate obligations. We continue to have zero borrowings on our $355 million credit facility and this facility also has $100 million accordion expansion feature. The initial term of this facility runs until May 2011, plus two one-year extension options thereafter. As of 12/31, we had $46.8 million of cash on hand. We retired the $100 million of bonds which matured in November and the $20 million of bonds that matured last month in January. So now, our next debt maturity isn’t until 2013. In summary, we currently have excellent liquidity, and our overall balance sheet remains healthy and safe. We have no exposure to variable-rate debt, and we have no need to raise capital for any balance sheet maturities over the next four years. Now let me turn the call back over to Tom, who will give you more background on these results.
Tom Lewis: Thanks, Paul. I will start with the portfolio. Obviously, it is doing pretty well today, especially given the state of the world. I would like, before I go through the numbers to say with that said, obviously retail is a tough place today and all of our tenants operate in the same economy that everybody else does and certainly, it is challenging for some of them. We have worked with a few of them to get through this period. But to date, to be frank, we have dodged a lot of bullets relative to the filings that you have seen out there with retailers. And in a few cases where we have had tenants that have had to file, we either have had just a property or two or three or we loan them more profitable properties and so to date, we haven't had a meaningful impact on our occupancy or on the operations. In all of our calls over the years, I think we have talked a lot about owning the more profitable properties or profitable stores of our tenants and that our high cash flow coverage of the rent repaid at store level is certainly our kind of margin of safety. If an industry or a tenant goes through a period where their revenues are dropping or their margins are impacted and I think that is just especially true today. Our 15 largest tenants today account for about 53.5% of our revenue and if you look at the average cash flow coverage, I know that we do this every quarter, for those of you who listen and on a regular basis. And last quarter, you will recall at the end of the third quarter, the cash flow coverage at the store level for the top 15, an average 2.79 times and ranged from about 1.7 to 4.55 times, which was very, very healthy. Obviously, a lot happened in the fourth quarter in all areas of retail as we all know and we have been getting updated numbers from the tenants for year end and while they lag a little, I think we are pretty current with most of them. And at the end of the fourth quarter, the average cash flow coverage for the top 15 was 2.4 times and ranged from 1.22 to 3.75, so obviously very healthy still. However, you can see some erosion in that and that is not surprising at all, but the coverage is also doing pretty well. I think that is the reason the portfolio has held up pretty well and we had a pretty good margin of safety. So we ended the fourth quarter at 97% occupancy, 70 properties available for lease out of the 2348, that is up 10 basis points from last quarter, which is great. It is a function, I think of some really effective leasing activity from the people on our portfolio management department. We are a little bit lucky here in that we built a fairly active portfolio management department to do our leasing in the last nine years, which is a little unusual sometimes at a net lease company. But given the age of our organization, we have now had in the last seven, eight, nine years over 900 properties where the leases have come to the end of the initial 15 years to 20 years lease and so we built that staff over the years. Really primarily they handle lease rollover and obviously if you get some vacancy today it is very, very helpful to have that staff up and operating to deal with any vacancy and I think it has served us pretty well. So it is 97% at the end of the quarter and it continues to collect pretty good operations. Same-store rents, as Paul mentioned on the core portfolio were up 24% in the fourth quarter, 1.1% for the year. That growth in same-store rent is lower than in recent quarters and I think that will be the case over the next year or so. It does include the reductions from the Buffets properties we renegotiated last year, but at this point, given the economy and kind of how things look, I'm going to assume that really same-store rent growth will be muted this year. However, with that said, I like the fact that it is same-store rent growth that is muted rather than the opposite. It is kind of instructive to see where the same-store rent declines and increases came over the year, but we have 30 retail industries in the portfolio. Five had declining same-store rents. The largest and the vast majority of the declines came where you would expect it, which is in restaurants. And when you consider that just under half of our exposure, restaurants are about 20% of the portfolio, is in fast food, which actually is doing very well. You can see in the casual dining segment and kind of the upper end segment, where we have very little, but that is where the declines would come from. The other four that were down were barely down at all. Two of our industries had flat same-store rents and then there were 23 that had same-store rent increases, but there were some real concentrations where it came from. Childcare accounted for about 27% of all of the increases, convenience store 24% and then tire and automotive services were about 20%. The rest of them were very small. And obviously I think that is reflective of what is working out there in retail today, which is kind of basic goods and services that you buy on an ongoing basis that have low price points and that just seems to be the segment that is – I do not know if it is growing but it has held up much better than the other more consumer discretionary and durable goods type of retail. If you look at the portfolio today, about two thirds of our revenue comes from those type of operators and those type I mean that the childcare, c-stores kind of fast food, anything from auto parts, tire, provision, which tends to be pretty stable throughout a period like this and then if you add in some grocery and drug and theater and health and fitness, I think that is the reason that most of those people revenues are holding up pretty good in this environment. We continue to be pretty well diversified. As I mentioned earlier, there are 2,348 properties in the portfolio. We have 30 different industries and 119 different chains in the portfolio and we are pretty well spread out throughout the country in 49 states, Hawaii being the only place that we are not to date. From an industry standpoint, (inaudible) restaurants is our largest industry. I mentioned it is at 20.8% at the end of the quarter, which is down from 24.2% the same quarter a year ago and as we have said for the last few quarters, we will pull there and we will be reducing that back below 20% over the next several quarters. Convenience stores at 16.4%, and as we look through the difference, other categories that we are in, it really goes down from there with theaters and childcare, theater is at about 9.1%, childcare about 7.5%. So, pretty good from an industry standpoint. At year end, our two largest tenants were only about 6% of rent, the next one is 5%. It goes on very quickly from there. And the top 10 comprise about 42% of rent, top 15 about 53% of rent, and when you get down to the fifteenth largest tenant, you are looking at only about 2% of revenue. Average remaining lease term in the portfolio, which is very nice today, is about 11.9 years and that has kept up there pretty well, really based on acquisitions over the last few years and releasing anything that came up under lease rollover. Overall then, with the portfolio, I have to tell you that given what we saw in the fourth quarter in retail and notwithstanding that a lot of what we own was kind of basic human needs low price points, we are pretty pleased that the portfolio held up and we are at 97% and have same-store rent growth. Relative to property acquisitions, we have continued to remain inactive pretty much ever since last February. During the fourth quarter, you saw in the press release, there was a very small addition in acquisitions but as it has been in the last few quarters those are primarily just some additional expenditures on some properties that we were developing and most of those I think we started in the fourth quarter of last year, first quarter this year and except for maybe a couple of hundred thousand, we are pretty much through with any development that the company had going on and out of that area. For the year, then that gave us $189 million in acquisitions, 108 properties, average cap rate was 8.7% with an average lease length of about 20 years and I think that is within a million or so of what we guessed last quarter. And again, we have intensely been not buying any property or kind of staying out of the acquisition market. We have believed for some time that obviously cap rates are rising and anything we could buy would probably be cheaper later. And given that, why not wait and I think that that has served us pretty well. As we speak and we kind of watch transaction flow out there and there's not a lot of transactions being completed. However, there are transactions being introduced into the market and cap rates are rising and we are seeing a few people trying to come to market with transactions and while they have adjusted cap rates up, I think not really enough and so I think that most of those transactions under a lot of them will probably just stall until you see a pretty good move up in cap rates. And you know, we continue to believe there are a lot of people out there with real estate on their books, they may have limited access to other forms of financing today. So at some point, we think we will see the cap rates move up further and more transactions in the marketplace. And we will wait until that happens, whenever that is. The other issue in acquisitions today, I will just bring up obviously is cost of capital in the market today. I think for us and almost everybody. And as you look at acquisitions and where cap rates are, I could probably go out and do things in the mid-9s today and approaching 10, but obviously if you look at your sources of capital, you have your credit line. That is not permanent capital, so I don’t think it makes sense to price it over your credit line. In the lease today, even if you're looking at BBB investment-grade senior unsecured, those are traded up over the other BBBs out there in the marketplace and you're probably looking at 12% plus. The preferred market has been heavily impacted by the financial institutions coming to market with a lot of paper in the fall and over the summer, so that market would be up beyond substantially the senior unsecured and really not attractive capital. So I really think if you're going to look today at acquisitions and you're going to look at permanent financing you have to be looking at your common and if you took our company for instance and used 20 a share is a round number and kind of mid ranged at guidance at $1.86 you would be looking at about a 9.3% FFO yield. If you gross that up for offering costs, you are probably up around 9.8% and since in the net lease business you really want to make sure you are securing a substantial spread upfront when you bite, I think you would have to be looking up at the 11% cap range today before it makes sense to go out and be buying anything and have inadequate spread over your cost to capital, notwithstanding that you would also want the underwriting to be pretty solid. So I think while things could change based on where we see the spread of our permanent capital right now, I do not anticipate that we will be buying anything in the first quarter or until the cap rates rise a fair amount or the cost of permanent capital comes down a bit. Cap rates may rise, I mentioned this last quarter but for myself I have to keep looking at it to keep it in my thinking. Next Tuesday is the 40th anniversary of Realty Income and I can go back over 40 years and look at where cap rates were every year and it is kind of interesting and if you take the last four years, 2005 to 2009, and look at our acquisitions, it was over $1.5 billion, cap rates ran at about 8.4% to 8.7% on the properties that we bought. In 2003 and 2004, the couple of years before that, they averaged 9.5% and then, going back from 2003 all the way back to 1994, cap rates every year were in the range of 10.3% to about 11.3%. And then I went back and dug out kind of previous to 1994, when we went public and in each year that the company bought from 1969 to 1994, cap rates were at 11% or slightly above. So I think all of us have been kind of sensitized in the last few years to 7% and 8% caps and like a lot of assets in many other areas, I think that we are really (inaudible) historically cheap financing rates and moving up over 10% again seems probably appropriate given what has happened in the credit markets. And I wouldn't be surprised if it happened and we will wait for a while until we see that. The other side of it obviously in this environment, which is fairly dynamic, to say the least, having cash and liquidity is a position that is a fairly attractive one I think for us and a lot of people right now. Let me just talk about Crest quickly. For those of you that are uninitiated, that is our subsidiary that we have operated for the last nine years or so that we buy in and subsequently sell property. We used it to buy big portfolios and then pair down our exposure to really maintain some diversification. And it has been a regular part of our business. Since we started it, it has made somewhere between $0.02 to $0.11 a share in FFO. So while it has been a fairly small part of our FFO, it has been in there. We did earn $0.11 in Crest in 2007, only a penny in 2008 as we closed it down and if you factor out our assets in Crest, our core FFO was up for the year and during 2007, the inventory peaked at about $140 million and we have been pairing it down the last 24 months basically not buying in Crest. As we have said in the release, we are down to five properties for $6 million. That is static from the third quarter. We're kind of just letting the properties sit there and they're available for sale if anybody wants them but not actively marketing in this market and effectively we are kind of out of that business. We think it is kind of risky business today and while we don't like the $0.10 differential in FFO as we closed Crest between 2007 and 2008, I think if we had not closed it down and got substantial inventory we would feel a lot worse about it. So in future calls, I probably won't say much about Crest at all, because we effectively have it closed down now. Let me comment on dividends for a moment, which seemed to be a pretty good area for a lot of people. As you all know, dividends are very much the priority here at the monthly dividend company. We will pay dividend in cash, I think that is no surprise to most folks, as most of our investors, some 70,000 rely on it to pay their bills or so they tell us. And cash is the priority as it has been for the last 40 years. I would anticipate at this point that the dividend will be higher this year than last year. How much will be dependent on operations. And I also would hopefully say that it is our goal to have it higher in 2010 than 2009. Dividends are really why we are here and it is a focus for the company. Paul commented on the balance sheet, paying off the $100 million of 8.25% notes and the $20 million of 8% notes with cash on hand. We were glad to get that done and so we are out till 2013 before any debt comes due. I think it is just the $100 million in 13, not in 14. So we're in pretty good shape there and as Paul said, we have good cash on hand and no balance on the line. So as we sit here today, the balance sheet is pretty simple, there are no JBs or developments going and nothing off balance sheet, so the business is pretty straightforward. The last area is on guidance. We tweaked our estimate to $1.83 to $1.90 this quarter. That is flat FFO growth to 3.8% and as I spent a lot of time talking about in the third quarter call, our estimates that we put out initially for 2009, we put out the low end at no acquisitions for the year, since that has traditionally been a pretty good driver of FFO growth and then on the top end, it was $500 million or about $125 million a quarter. As I mentioned a little earlier, we do not anticipate buying anything in the first quarter so our guidance this time really runs from no acquisitions on the low side and then we backed off the $500 million to $375 million. And taking that $125 million of acquisitions out in the first quarter, obviously that would have been the acquisitions for the year that contributed to the revenue side primarily and backing that out had an impact and then secondarily, what we also did, given our stance on acquisition right now, for the $125 million in the second quarter, we made the assumption that all of that would come in at the end of the quarter and that gets us then from zero acquisitions to 375. On the low end or both ends really we have also assumed some additional vacancy or lower same-store rent growth for 2009 given the economy. We have built anything that we can see now in the portfolio with our retailers into that number, and to be frank, we also just added in another penny or two assuming that something else would come down the line that we can’t see right now, but I think where we sit right now, that is a pretty good estimate, absent any material changes, and I will leave it to everybody listening to figure out where the economy goes and then we will all have a better picture. Obviously, it is challenging that visibility for almost anybody out there today with long term leases and pretty good occupancy number, it is a little easier, but it is a dynamic environment. To kind of summarize and given the circumstances, we are pleased, particularly with occupancy and where the portfolio sits. It will be interesting to see how the year progresses and we all look forward to as I am sure you do to the economy getting better, whenever that is. And with that, Michael, if you will, we will go ahead and open it up to questions and if anybody would like to chat a bit, we will do that.
Operator: So we will begin the question-and-answer session at this time. (Operator instructions) Our first question is from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Hi there.
Tom Lewis: I’m sorry.
Operator: I’m sorry, Mr. Bilerman.
Operator: Did you have a question?
Tom Lewis: Maybe we’ll move on with it. We’ll move on. If Michael wants to get any, he can queue back up. Sorry about that.
Operator: Anthony Polini with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Anthony Polini – JP Morgan: Okay, thanks. Good afternoon.
Paul Meurer: Hi.
Anthony Polini – JP Morgan: All right. I was looking – if I look at your annualized revenues divided by the occupied number of stores, about $140,000 a year per store it seems. Can you give us a sense as to – if a store goes dark, obviously, you lose the $140,000 but how much expenses would you be on the hope for?
Tom Lewis: Yes. It obviously varies, which I’m sure you know, but our kind of ballpark around the shop, if you lose a buck of rent, you probably want to add on $0.20 or so in expenses. And that’s a pretty good rule of thumb and then it just depends on the property and age, and what is going on in the part of the country it is in and whether it is a theater or a convenience store. But that is a good ballpark, if you lose a buck of rent you probably want to add on another $0.20 in expenses.
Anthony Polini – JP Morgan: Okay, great. And then, I was wondering if you could put some parameters around your auto dealership exposure in terms of maybe brands or domestics versus imports, things like that.
Tom Lewis: Sure. Obviously, we don’t get into great GPL relative to the individual tenants, but the dealership is primarily one tenant, so it is a good-sized guy. He’s kind one of the largest, most successful in his business. Fortunately, he’s got a fairly strong service business and fair retail running off that because sales throughout the dealership industry whether it is cars, boat, RVs, almost anything, any durable goods is just really severely impacted. So that is the one if you look, at in the third quarter, where I said the range from cash flow coverages was 1.77 to the mid-fours, that’s the one that’s down at 1.22. The good news, if you can call it good news, is the 1.22, I think that’s pretty much assuming no sales, and all of the revenue coming from the other sides of the business. But that’s an impacted one. We’re also fortunate that it’s also somebody who has an extraordinarily good balance sheet.
Anthony Polini – JP Morgan: Okay. And then just last question, along the same lines, just movie theaters and how you are feeling about those and their performance these days.
Tom Lewis: Yes, we feel very good about movie theaters. That has turned out to be as – it’s been speculated sometimes to be cheap entertainment and while people are doing a lot of whatever is required spending in basic human need, low price point, people don’t stop entertaining themselves. And so, I think if you look at people cocooning a little more, but they’re also getting out and when they get out, they’re staying away from very expensive stuff. But the theaters are doing pretty good. If you look last year, I think, they were off a little bit relative to traffic but up in price, and it has been a pretty good slide of movies out there and content always drives the box office. So the numbers we’re getting from our theaters are pretty good and we also had a group of theaters that have particularly high coverage, so I don’t think we have any issues there, Tony.
Anthony Polini – JP Morgan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line if Justin Tissell [ph] of Banc of America. Please go ahead.
Justin Tissell – Banc of America: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon, guys.
Paul Meurer: Hi, Justin.
Justin Tissell – Banc of America: Tom, can you just maybe put some numbers around that vacancy loss assumption that you guys have in the guidance for us? And in the last quarter, you mentioned I think 100 basis points. Does that still sound about right or –?
Tom Lewis: Yes, we widened it out a little bit.
Paul Meurer: It is a full 1% and really up to 2%, so it is kind of a 1% to 2% bandwidth. You know, when we go to the 2% in kind of our model, if you will, that may assume a few acquisitions on the back end. So if you look at zero acquisitions, then we are looking at kind of 1% to 1.5% occupancy loss. Does that make sense?
Justin Tissell – Banc of America: If you look at zero, you’re looking at 1% and 1.5%. Okay, I’m just trying to figure out if you take – to get to the guidance stage, if you take the run rate from this quarter and you annualize it, you essentially get to the low end of the guidance range. So with no acquisitions and vacancy loss, I’m just trying to figure it out.
Paul Meurer: We have some vacancy lost. We have some, thanks to our rent growth. We have less interest expense, etc.
Tom Lewis: Our numbers internally at – with zero – get us a little higher.
Justin Tissell – Banc of America: Okay. And then when you look at those coverages that you mentioned earlier on, I mean, at what point – when you look at the, I guess, the midpoint of that, that two four in the low end, I mean it looks like the midpoint was down about 15% in the low end, 30%. I mean, at what point do you guys start to get concerned about potentially tenants coming back to try and – either renegotiate leases or on the low end, bankruptcy-type scenarios, I mean have you had increase in levels of concern there, any increasing conversations with your tenants recently?
Tom Lewis: I don’t know that they’re increasing. We had a lot of discussions with them last year too. But I – it’s interesting, I mentioned earlier, we’ve done 900 lease rollovers and that’s when you get to the end of the lease and the tenants has got to put on the property. So we’ve got a big data base and almost all of the time, if it was less than a 1 to 1, we got it back. If it was a 1 to 1.25, they’re going to want a rent cut or we’re getting it back. At about 1.35, they start going, I’d really need a rent cut. I’d really like one. Gee, this is my put opportunity. But that’s when they start going. I just don’t want to give up that EBITDA because it’s positive. And at 1.5, you’re feeling okay. That can give you a huge margin of safety on the downside, but you’re feeling okay. So sitting up at 2.4 today, and we’ve done a bunch of sensitivities, we took the cash flow coverage in the top 15 that averages 2.4. And then, add the research part and say, “If you took a full another turn of 10% drop in revenue out.” And by the way, a 10% drop in revenue impacts each industry dramatically different. In some, a 10% drop of revenue can take a 2.0 to 1.2. In another industry, a 10% drop takes a 2.0 to 1.8. But if you average it all out, if after the first quarter you had another in 10% drop of revenue, the 2.4 goes to about a 2.0. And it’s really – at 2.0, we’re still very comfortable. And the reason we’ve never underwritten the 2.0 and we wanted it higher is to give us the margin of safety, and now we are using it. But as long as we’re up around 2.0 then I’m comfortable. It gets below that, I get a little more uncomfortable. But at a 1.5, the majority of the stores, somebody is not going to walk away from. What happens though, obviously, is all of these you have a bell curve. And if your bell curve is a 2.4 at the peak, and a 3.77 on the right and a 1.22 on the left, when you do sit out with a retailer, the ones on the left side of the bell curve, you’re going to be talking about a handful of properties with somebody. And that’s been absolutely typical over the years. But at 2.4, we’re still really high.
Justin Tissell – Banc of America: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wachovia Securities. Please go ahead.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: Good afternoon, guys.
Tom Lewis: Hey, Jeff.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: I guess continuing that line of questioning, it used to be that you couldn’t help try to avoid retailers or financial institutions that (inaudible) lead counter was on the stores should be attractive not a little economic. But then it go – and what we’re hearing from other landlords, not necessarily just net lease landlords, is that retailers these days seem to be much more arbitrary around their decisions for closing stores because it’s more of a credit than liquidity for them. I’m not sure that’s inventory driven or just balance sheet capacity driven, but is that in your experience of late, have you found it to be less orderly?
Tom Lewis: You know, it has been a little less orderly and strangely enough, the law of unintended consequences, the new bankruptcy law really tightened up the time they have to make those decisions. So, on the margin, as the time gets close, where they used to sit around and really hem and hob about properties and you’d get there at some point now, they do have to make a decision, and it does cause them maybe to let a few go away where they had before. And we’ve seen a few of those in our numbers. The other thing, Jeff, that comes up today is obviously – and it kind of come in two phases. First which a lot of people filed, and then what happen is the DIP financing or debtor in possession market went away. You went from about 14 lenders out there to two or three, and there had been a couple of cases you’ve seen out there where people couldn’t get DIP financing and went right to chapter seven. What happened now is that has eased up a little and then you’ve had some, I’d say more aggressive individuals enter that market and kind of DIP to own so that has eased up a bit. But it is been a little bit less orderly than it might have been in the past. There are probably a few or some profitable properties went away because somebody couldn’t get financing. But, generally, absent closing a region where you’ll get a few, it still is high casual coverage and you end up in pretty good shape. But you’re making a good point. It is a little more messy today than it has been in the past years.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: And I’m curious much of you are able to do this. But if you have to guess where industry wide occupancy was, I guess, for the net lease business, say at year-end 2008, where do you guess, staying where we are today, where do you guess that goes at year-end ’09 and say year-end 2010?
Tom Lewis: That’s a pretty good guess and calls for a big macro call on the economy, which I don’t have. Fourth quarter was absolute mess, which we all know, albeit really centered around those more consumer durable and non-discretionary. First quarter, actually, January to date, I think things haven’t gotten materially worse, but they haven’t gotten better. And so, then it is your macro call. And I really – I would say it’s almost impossible for me to tell. If you see the economy really start moving soft, again, another round of job cuts takes it in the opposite direction, then you are probably going to see that down at around – I would say our (inaudible) is higher than the industry in general. If it were at 97, I’d put the industry profit around 93, 92 and I’m guessing here. And if you have another good couple of bad turns in the economy, and then I think the whole market might be around 93, 92 and 91. And I would assume we will be a couple of points or something higher.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: But I guess what I generally mean – do you think that it’s possible for the industry to shed 300 or 400 basis points for occupancy in a year or just that seems dramatic to you?
Tom Lewis: The answer is the generic industry, yes. Okay? I think its income is down. This underwriting to cash flow coverage is fairly unusual, although it may not seem to those who follow the rates because it’s talked about. We started doing it about 13, 14 years, 15 years ago. And to my knowledge, the guys at FFCA Spirit did it very effectively, and then a couple of other people in the last few years. But I would say probably 90% of all of the net leases that are in existence, the landlord does not have the ability to look through and understand what the profitability of the unit is, so it’s rather unusual. We’ve underwritten to it, which has been very helpful. So I could very much see another 200 to 300, 400 basis points generically, but I think it would bifurcate off if you knew upfront when you’re underwriting how profitable the properties are and you ought to do a little better.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: Are you willing to share at this point, maybe, what’s happened with its income to occupancy in the first 45 days of the year?
Tom Lewis: No, we report at the end of the quarter, as always. Quite frankly, I thought it might tick down 10 basis points last quarter. We had nine properties go vacant last quarter and much to my surprise, our leasing people had a very active quarter and leased 12 and therein lies the difference between 96.9 and 97. So, I wouldn’t be surprised to see it tick down a bit, but nothing dramatic as of this point. And again, I’m very pleased with the efforts of the people in our Leasing Department over the last few months in this market and I think I’ll continue to be. It is making a huge difference. Again, on our part when we put together, basically, deal with lease rollover, I’m glad that we have it.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: So, one last question and maybe this is just looking down the road, which I don’t know how long it is. Clearly, I know we’re not through this predicament yet in the economy and hopefully, there are another side to this chasm, but when we get to that point, are there operating or financing lessons that you guys have gleaned right now from your experiences thus far that maybe incorporate it at that future view?
Tom Lewis: Yes. It is just for being a little bit shell-shocked through a hundred-year flood, you don’t have some lessons that you’ll hang on to, you’re probably not human. So, while we’ve always thought we wanted high cash flow coverages, I’d think that I’d want them equal or higher; but on the low end, we would do deals in kind of at the 1.75 closeout at the low end for just a few properties that we really like them and I probably wouldn’t do that again, but that’s minor in nature. We’ve always really concentrated on the unsecured underwriting. If we thought that they did get in trouble from balance sheet perspective, then it’d definitely be an 11 and not a 7, and I’d probably look at that even a little bit harder as we’ve seen what’s happened this time with those. Also, you sit there and you say we do basic human needs and low price points and that’s a vast majority of everything we do, and then you always have two or three transactions you did in the seven-year period were outworking. And to be perfectly frank, there’s one that kind of didn’t fit the mold, but we had a good reason and the good reason held up and then there are two where we now sit there and hit ourselves in the forehead and go, “Wait a minute. Didn’t this have two things against if and somehow, because of one property, we bought his one and somehow we did it again.” And so you just – I think if we just go back and be even more strict than what we did, then overall, I’d say I’m pretty pleased thus far in how well it has held up.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: Aside from credit, any buys and towards geography or even by industry like restaurants or Hawaii?
Tom Lewis: I have a definite prejudice for Hawaii and I think it’ll take some due diligence on a senior level in a short-term basis like Maui. But geographically, it’s funny we both stayed a little bit of concentration in the south, in the west, in the east, because you get economic growth and it bails you out of some dumb decisions, and then you get a housing crisis in the area that you were looking at that had the economic growth has the reverse of it and you’re glad that you stayed very well-diversified all the way around. And as long as you’re stating a basic human need, there are people up in the mid west and that’s actually the most stable part of the portfolio right now. As we’ve identified, we continue to see. You don’t want to get too rural, I guess, unless you’re in a convenient on two state routes, so staying close to SMAs, those are all little lessons of the margin stuff we knew, but maybe you could be a little more disciplined in the future then you were in the past.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: Okay. Thank you, guys.
Operator: All right. Thank you, Michael. Michael Bilerman with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: My phone working now?
Tom Lewis: There we go.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: There we go.
Paul Meurer: We can hear you.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: Greg Schweitzer is on with me as well. Tom, when you look at the expiries this year, you have a much bigger percentage of guys who are on their subsequent expiration that had never renewed in the past versus the initial. Can you drill down a little bit in looking at your expirations this year and time that with 100, 150 basis points and occupancy for those coming up with report the.
Tom Lewis: Thank God that the two-thirds are of more second rolls in this market. The second roll has always been better. These are properties that have been launched and they wanted them because they make them a lot of money, and we think that’s the case. We just went through this in portfolio management. We think it’s breakeven. There may be down a point. We think we’re going to retain the vast majority and we don’t look at that as really where the occupancy change might come. I think if it comes, it’s going to be under rollover and we feel very good about rollover.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  And then, and so this is 4% of – how much of square footage does that actually represent?
Tom Lewis:  It’s probably a little less than that.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  Less than 4% square footage, so they’re above market rate?
Tom Lewis:  No, no. They’re just smaller buildings.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup:  Is it the kind of way to look at them?
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup:  Yes, I think Greg has some questions also.
Tom Lewis:  Sure.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup:  I know you guys all keep talking about tenant specifics, but just touching on (inaudible), there’s a lot going on in Australia right now with ABC Learning. About 25% of the assets are – their (inaudible) are looking at non-binding office to buy out those properties. Could you just provide a bit of color on what’s happening with the US assets and maybe, specifically, your exposure?
Tom Lewis:  Yes. As we went through in some detail last year when ABC went up, there was a lot of misconceptions relative to what was going there in the US. The US units that we own are fairly strong. I don’t have a concern about them. And last year, ABC sold the majority interest in the US Company, so they are no longer the owner of it, they are a minority owner.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup:  And any color that you can provide on how your assets are performing, maybe cash flow coverages?
Tom Lewis:  We don’t give them out for individual tenants, but they’re performing adequately. They’ve been in the portfolio now for, in most cases, for over 20 years; so, those were properties that were purchased at very low prices many years ago. Gary, do you remember what the average cost of those is?
Gary Malino: Yes, the average cost of our units – this is really important, it was about $400,000, $500,000, where replacement cost today for a newer unit, you’d be looking at $1 million, $1.2 million, $1.3 million. So, even with some rent increases, you’re really looking at those being on the very low end of the rents they pay and amazingly enough, there’s pretty good correlation between profitability and low rent. So, I can just tell you that coverages are probably not up to our average, but they’re very comfortable.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup:  Okay, thanks. And just one more, any tenant that you put on the watch list that you’re a little bit concerned about?
Tom Lewis:  Well, we have a couple of tenants on the watch list, but nobody eminent. And what we’ve done, although we don’t know if there’s going to be an impact, we put what we thought what would be the impact in guidance and then added some more in; but nobody eminent that I’m aware of today that would have a meaningful impact on us outside of what we’ve got in guidance.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup:  Okay, thanks.
Operator:  All right, thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Coleman with Conseco Capital Management. Please go ahead.
Scott Coleman – Conseco Capital Management:  Asked and answered. Thank you.
Operator:  All right, thank you. (Operator instructions) Tom Coleman with Kensico Capital Management. Please go ahead.
Tom Coleman – Kensico Capital Management:  All the properties you have for sale in Crest, are they all vacant?
Tom Lewis:  No. We only have five. We’ve had up to 120. Three of them are former Buffets. They’re vacant, but for those of you who will recall, a couple of quarters ago, we impaired them by over 50% in value. So, those are vacant, but we wrote them down by half. The other two are fully occupied, paying rents, and pretty good properties; so, there are only five.
Tom Coleman – Kensico Capital Management:  And then the properties that you offer for sale that are vacant that aren’t in Crest. What does that mean? They’re just on the balance sheet – how are they presented differently in the financial statements?
Tom Lewis:  They are just properties in the portfolio.
Paul Meurer:  Yes. You would find them just in our real estate portfolio on the balance sheet because in actuality, they are consistently marketed for sale or for lease with a preference towards lease. We’d like to generate income to pay our dividends. So when you look at our balance sheet, you’re not going to find them in the for sale category. That’s going to be the Crest up at the moment. There might be one or two from the lease where it’s clear. That’s what it is, a for sale property. Maybe, there’s an LLI place we’re moving forward with and it would fall into that, but otherwise, you’re going to find the lease vacant properties in the real estate held for investment.
Tom Lewis:  Yes. If you look at the 12 that – you see, there were 12 that went out of the vacant category, and nine were released and three were sold. And if you look in the sales last year, the majority was not vacant properties. They were occupied properties.
Tom Coleman – Kensico Capital Management:  And the prices that you have, the prices that you’re offering those at, do they relate in any way to the GAAP value of that property?
Paul Meurer:  We have tended to sell the properties at a GAAP gain and that has been the case this year too.
Tom Lewis:  Yes.
Tom Coleman – Kensico Capital Management:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  All right, thank you. And our next question is from the line of Rich Moore with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets:  Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I’m curious on this, the credit market has come roaring back suddenly or cap rates shoot was higher, how quickly do you actually begin closing on things? Are you actively reviewing a lot of portfolios or how is that working right now?
Tom Lewis:  Realistically or probably, it could be inside but I would say I think 60 to 90. We have transactions that are coming over the trends. We have things downstairs we’re looking at right now. They get reviewed, so it’s merely a decision to say, “Here’s the cap rate and yes, we’re buying,” and we would be at the right price. But last year, as an example, we stopped buying in the second quarter and we bought $189 million. We still had $5 billion go through the committee last year, so the number of transactions reviewed last year was roughly equivalent to what it was the year before when we bought $533 million. So, we keep the flow going through. What we do is we cut it off about halfway through because we don’t want people to think that we’re going to close when we’re not, but we are actively reviewing. If the prices were right, would we actively go? But I think if I said today, “Boy, look at where cap rate’s got and we’d want to go,” I think you’d be looking at 60 to 90 days as a good guess.
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets:  Okay. And then you mentioned that maybe nine to ten is what you’re seeing at the moment and I assume that’s some kind of average. Are you seeing anything at all that’s attractive in the 11% range or is there nothing up there yet?
Tom Lewis:  No. How was that?
Rich Moore – RBC Capital Markets:  Yes, that’s fair. That’s very fair. And I certainly know where interest rates are and financing cost, so anyway, great. Thank you guys very much.
Operator:  All right, thank you. Mr. Lewis, there are no further questions at this time. Please continue with any closing comments.
Tom Lewis:  Okay. Well, thank you everybody. I think, again, with reports from this quarter, we’ll all watch the economy and we operate the same way as everyone else. We manage portfolio and see how we sit next quarter. It’s a dynamic environment. Thank you all very much.
Operator:  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Realty Income fourth quarter earnings conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a very pleasant rest of your day.

Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the Conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of Realty Income, Tom Lewis. Please go ahead, sir.
Tom Lewis: Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our conference call, where we’ll run through the third quarter and nine months, and then see if we can give some color or additional information on the balance of the year. In the room with me today is Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and CFO; Mike Pfeiffer, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel; and Tere Miller, as always, our Vice President, Corporate Communications. And as I am oriented to do on all of these is to say during this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law. The company’s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters disclosed in any forward-looking statements, and we will disclose in greater detail on the company’s quarterly 10-Q the factors that may cause such differences. And Paul, if you want to start up by going through the numbers, that’ll be great.
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Tom. As usual, I’m going to comment on our financial statements, provide a few highlights of our financial results for the third quarter, starting with the income statement. Total revenue increased 12.2% for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2007. Rental revenue increased to approximately $82.2 million in the quarter as a result of new property acquisitions. Same-store rental revenue increased 1.1% for the quarterly period, and other income was $322,000 for the quarter. On the expense side, interest expense increased by about $7.8 million during the third quarter as compared to the third quarter of last year and this increase is due to more bonds outstanding as compared to a year ago, the $550 million of 2019 notes that we issued in September of 2007. We had zero borrowings on our credit facility throughout the third quarter. On a related note, our interest coverage ratio continues to be strong, at 3.2 times, while our fixed-charge coverage ratio was 2.5 times. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by about $3.4 million in the comparative quarterly period, as depreciation expense has increased as our portfolio continues to grow. General and administrative expenses, or G&A expenses, for the third quarter were about $5.1 million, a reduction of almost $1.2 million from last year. G&A represents only 6.2% of total revenues for the quarter. We expect G&A expenses in 2008 to remain below 2007 levels. Property expenses increased by $963,000 for the quarter and these are the expenses primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance, and insurance expenses, which we are responsible for on properties that are available for lease or sale. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company, and these taxes total $308,000 for the quarterly period. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter was $6.1 million. Real estate acquired for resale refers to the operations of Crest Net Lease, our subsidiary that acquires and resells properties. Crest sold three properties for $4.6 million for the quarter, for a gain on sale of $199,000 and overall for the quarter, Crest contributed income of $238,000. Real estate held for investment refers to property sales by Realty Income from our existing core portfolio. We sold 13 properties during the third quarter, resulting overall in income of $5.9 million. These property sales gains are not included in our funds from operations. Preferred stock cash dividends remained at $6.1 million for the quarter, and net income available to common stockholders was $28.6 million for the quarter. Funds from operations, or FFO, were approximately $45.7 million for the quarter. FFO per share was $0.46 for the quarter versus $0.47 per share for the same quarter a year ago. However, our FFO before Crest contribution, or the FFO from our core portfolio, remained at $0.45 per share for the comparative quarterly period. For the nine-month period year-to-date, our FFO before Crest contribution increased to $1.37 per share, versus $1.34 per share a year ago, or an increase of 2.2% in earnings year-to-date from our core portfolio. When we file our 10-Q, we will again provide information you need to compute our adjusted funds from operations, or AFFO, or our cash available for distribution as dividends. Our AFFO, or CAD, is typically higher than our FFO, as our capital expenditures are generally relatively low, and we don’t have a great deal of straight-line rent in the portfolio. Our continued growth in core earnings allowed us to increase our monthly dividend twice this quarter. We have increased the dividend 44 consecutive quarters and 51 times overall since we went public over 14 years ago. Our current monthly dividend is now $0.141125 per share, which equates to a current annualized amount of $1.6935 per share. Now let’s turn to the balance sheet for a moment. We’ve continued to enhance our conservative and safe capital structure. Our debt-to-total market capitalization is 33%, and our preferred stock outstanding represents just 8% of our capital structure and all of these liabilities are fixed-rate obligations. We continue to have zero borrowings on our new $355 million credit facility. This facility also has $100 million accordion expansion feature. The initial term of this facility runs until May 2011, plus two one year extension options thereafter. In September, we were very pleased to raise $75 million in a common equity offering. As noted on the balance sheet, we now have $113 million of cash on hand. We will use this cash and other cash being generated by our portfolio to repay our $100 million of bonds maturing next month and the $20 million of bonds maturing in January 2009 and thereafter, our next debt maturity isn’t until 2013. In summary, we currently have excellent liquidity, and our overall balance sheet remains healthy and safe. We have no exposure to variable-rate debt, and we have no need to raise capital for any balance sheet maturities for almost five years. Now let me turn the call back over to Tom, who will give you more background on these results.
Tom Lewis: Thank you, Paul and as is our custom, I’ll just run through the various areas of the Business and I’ll start with the portfolio. We ended the third quarter with 96.9% occupancy in 73 properties available for lease. That’s out of the 2,355 we own. That’s up 10 BPs from last quarter and I’ll tell you, I never thought I would get excited about occupancy going up 10 BPs, but I am, given this environment, and we’ll certainly take that. We had 14 new vacancies for the quarter. We re-leased 12 of those, and we sold four property which gets us to the increase in occupancy. Only four of the 14 new vacancies came from credit default, from a couple of smaller tenants this quarter. That’s obviously not a large number, given the 2,300 properties and the other 10, the balance, really came through the normal lease rollover that’s going on in the portfolio at all times, which ebbs and flows, so pretty good there. Our sense, looking forward for the fourth quarter as of right now, is occupancy should remain strong. We’re not seeing a lot of default reflected in the portfolio at the moment, but obviously, the retail environment is very tough, and things could change. I think we have a good handle on the lease rollover, and we’re making decent progress on the leasing that comes up. So our expectations as of right now would be once again very high; 96% to 97% occupancy at the end of the fourth quarter, so fairly stable. Same-store rents, as you saw in the release, on the core portfolio, increased 1.1% during the third quarter, 1.3% for the year. Most of you know we have 30 retail industries in the portfolio. Two had declining same-store rents, three were flat, and then most of the portfolio, different industries, had some type of increasing rent, with about half the overall increases coming from three industries, which is childcare, interestingly enough, restaurant; and convenience stores. I think we continue to be very well-diversified with the portfolio. Relative to the total number of properties, we had a decrease of 12 properties in the portfolio during the quarter from 2,367 to 2,355 and that really was generated by the sale of a few restaurant properties out of the portfolio, where we pruned some units to reduce concentration and we are keeping that money in cash and have not invested it through a 1031 back into property. As I mentioned, there are 30 retail industries in the portfolio, 118 chains in 49 states and I think the industry exposure remains fairly well diversified. Restaurants are our largest industry, at 21.4% for the quarter. That’s down from 21.7% last quarter and 23.7% in the first quarter and then 24.2% at the end of the fourth quarter last year. So we continue to make a little progress in terms of reducing the concentration. We’ve said in previous calls that we’re full in that sector and want to reduce that back down under 20%, and we’re doing that. Convenience stores are the second-largest industry at 16.3%. It then goes to theaters at 9.1%. Childcare is down to about 7.7%, which was once our largest. So we continue to be mindful of diversification. On a tenant basis, our largest tenant is 5.9% of rents, next one’s 5.4%. Everybody else in the portfolio is below 5% of rents and if you put the top 15 tenants together, they comprise about 53.7% of our revenue, which is down a bit from last quarter. By the way, when you get to the 15th-largest tenant, that’s only about 2.2% of revenue and when you get to the 21st, you’re down to 1%. So the vast majority of all of the tenants in the portfolio, even the larger ones, are a fairly small percentage of revenue and we’re pretty well diversified. The average lease length in the portfolio remains long, at 12.1 years and relative to the overall health of the portfolio, again, our 15 largest tenants are about 53.7%. Our best metric that we watch for credit in our portfolio is the cash flow coverage at the store level for the rent that’s being paid. That’s the individual store’s cash flow to the retailer EBITDA divided by the rent and that shows us how much we’re really covering rent on a store and unit basis, which is our best method of credit and profitability. The average cash flow coverage for our largest 15 tenants for the quarter was 2.79 times. That ranged from a low on a tenant basis of 1.7 times to 4.55 times, which is very, very healthy. That compares last quarter to 2.7 times, so actually up a bit, and a range of 1.77 to 4.55 and we continue to believe that’ll give us a really good margin of safety and is really the primary thing that are going to allow the tenants to pay in this environment. I do want to make a couple comments on those numbers. As always, they’re not real-time. We get the reports from our larger tenants quarterly on some, annually on others, so they do tend to lag and we like to make sure everybody knows that and I think the number probably would have dropped a little bit this quarter if it had been real-time, obviously, because of the slowdown that we saw in retail going back to September, where I think retail sales were up about 1.2% throughout the country and I think you would have seen it in our portfolio, too. The other thing in there is that the rent concessions that we gave to Buffets at the end of the fourth quarter really reset their cash flow coverage’s up to higher numbers, higher coverage and that obviously helped the number, but I would also note that generally, we like our cash flow coverage numbers to increase through the store’s EBITDA going up, and not through the rent going down. So while we’re pleased that it’s high coverage generally, it’s preferable if it happens through the tenants doing a little better. However, the cash flow coverage do remain very high, and we think that’s what gives us our best margin of safety and that’s important to us in this environment, and I think continues to be why the portfolio does very well. I’ll move on to property acquisitions. During the third quarter, we invested a whopping $400,000 in one property at a 10.1 cap. That was a convenience store. It was another $3.9 million completing a couple of development properties. The development properties were all transactions started late last year or at the end of the first quarter, and that pretty much complete any development that we have in the portfolio. Those are all now paying rent and we won’t have a lot of funds going out for development, as we’ve just moved away from that in this market environment. We’ve been using for acquisitions $250 million for the year. For the nine months, we’re at $188 million and we’re now assuming that we do not buy really anything else in the fourth quarter, and that that $188 million is our estimate for guidance. That obviously could change if we saw some motivated sellers willing to go with higher cap rates, but for now, we’re going to assume no acquisitions in the quarter, which is what we’ve been doing for the last couple of quarters. It’s been an act of volition, really intentional, for us not to be out buying properties. We thought prices would decline and cap rates rise and generally, anything that we would have bought in the last few quarters we could have bought at a better, higher cap rate today or in future quarters and we continue to believe that’s the case. So I think that’s served us pretty well. I will say, though, that I think cap rates are definitely rising, while transaction volume’s gone down quite a bit. We’re starting to see a fair number of people, or a good number, coming to market, trying to use their real estate to raise some capital and in most cases, I think they’ve adjusted cap rates upwards, but in our view not enough. So I think the transactions we’re seeing, a number of them won’t get done until cap rates rise enough to interest some of the buyers like ourselves sitting out there, but we are seeing that movement. We continue to believe that there are a lot of people out there that have real estate on their books that don’t have great access to other forms of capital, and that they’re really going to have some capital needs that are coming up on them and have thought that probably next year, if the capital markets don’t come back, they’re going to need to bring those to market and that likely will be the impetus to move cap rates and probably close the bid-ask spread that you see there out in the market, that has really caused declining number of acquisitions. As I mentioned, we’re starting to see that. I think caps are going to have to move up into the 10% range to really start things moving. I can tell you that 10 caps have creped into the discussions that we’ve had with several tenants over the last month or so and while they’re not there yet, I do believe that they’re moving in that direction and it wouldn’t surprise me at all to see a few acquisitions go off at above that price for people who need the capital. It’s interesting, when we talk about 10 caps to people, that it seems very high to them, but on a historical basis, it really isn’t. Obviously, we’ve been in this business for 39 years and I went back and looked at the cap rates that we did in each of the years that we’ve been in business and the last three years, kind of 2005 through 2008, our cap rates have run from 8.42% as a low up to the 8.7% that we’re doing this year and we’ve done about $1.5 billion in acquisitions at that price. And then look back at 2003 and 2004, and cap rates were over 9%, really closer to a mid-9% range, in those years. 1994 to 2003, which is really when we came public, up until just a few years ago, cap rates ranged from 10.35% to 11.3% and previous to 1994, as I went back, cap rates were right around 11% in each year that I looked back, going back into the early ‘70s. So I think the 7% and 8% caps that we’ve seen out in the 1031 market in the last few years, like a lot of pricing at other asset classes, are really a function of what was some historically cheap financing and moving up over 10% probably seems appropriate and really not that surprising, particularly if we look at what we’ve compared things against in the last few years, which were credit spreads, which have obviously gapped out in the debt markets and so it’s probably appropriate that it happen in net leases, too. I think we’ll wait a bit to go higher. I think we will make some acquisitions next year and it really doesn’t bother us to be patient right now. Obviously in this environment, a little liquidity is not a bad idea, either. So we really don’t mind having some cash on hand and no balance on the line. I’ll move on to Crest for a moment. That’s obviously our subsidiary that acquires and then sells properties. We’ve been in that business about eight years and it’s a business where we booked FFO, but obviously, unlike our core revenue from long-term leases, its contribution is based primarily on property sales and because of that; its cash flow is very volatile. We started that business in 2002 and going through kind of 2002 through 2006, it made anywhere from $0.02 to $0.10 in FFO per year. Last year, in ‘07, it was $0.11 and this year, we’re looking at a penny and that last year’s $0.11 was obviously a function of starting the year with a lot of inventory and a high level of sales. That inventory peaked at $140 million last year and since the beginning of last year, we’ve been pairing inventory through sales, really for about 20 months now. We bought nothing in Crest six of the last seven quarters, and nothing for the last four quarters and we plan no acquisitions in Crest as of right now. Inventory held for sale there is down to five properties for $6 million. So effectively, we are out of that business, really until market conditions change substantially, or we feel we need to use Crest and market conditions change for acquisitions. We’ve thought for some time that cap rates would be moving up and prices down, and really thought holding inventory for sale would really give us some risk to the operation because of the mark-to-mark component of that business for pricing, if your cap rate that you bought at moves through the cap rate that you’re selling at and so, while it’s cost us about $0.10 a share in FFO; we’ve had less FFO this year versus last year to get out of that business; we think it has been prudent, and that’s where we’re going to stay. Moving on to dividends, as Paul said, we’ve been increasing the dividends. I would anticipate we’d look for dividend growth to continue in 2009. I think it’ll likely be at a moderate pace that will match probably our FFO growth over the next year or so. I wanted to just cover one more time, as Paul did, the balance sheet, which is in great shape and obviously with the retained earnings, a few property sales and the capital from the equity offering we did, we’ll have cash on hand to pay off the $100 million at 8.25% 10-year paper that we had, and the other $20 million coming due in January. And post that, given that we just recast the $355 million credit line, we’ll have no maturities, as Paul said, to 2013 and no balance on the line. So, sitting here with no mortgages on any of the properties, and no need for capital and a strong balance sheet, feels very good right now for the business. As to guidance, we revised our estimates for 2008 to $1.82 to $1.84 and that revision really reflects having the additional number of common shares outstanding after the recent equity offering. Also, the assumption in there that there were a couple of remaining Crest properties that we thought might sell at the end of the year, and we now think those will move into next year, and also that we’re not going to acquire additional acquisitions for the balance of this year. And while it’s minor, I think it’ll show up that since we have sold some properties out of the portfolio, and we’re keeping the cash from those properties rather than reinvesting, that’s pretty much how we get to that number. By the way, I think that means that our FFO for the year will be down a bit. Our core FFO before Crest will be up a bit for the year. For 2009, we really talked at length about guidance internally and posted $1.86 to $1.96, which would be 1.1% to 7.7% FFO growth. For next year, we will have lost Crest out of the numbers, so really looking at zero probably, to a penny at best in Crest, so almost everything in the guidance coming from the core portfolio. It’s obviously one of the more interesting times that we’ve had trying to think about guidance for 2009, with everything going on in the economy and while we’re in great shape from a balance sheet standpoint, trying to estimate, I think, first acquisition to this point or the movement of the portfolio is difficult. So as we put the guidance together, the $1.86 in 2009 estimates no acquisitions in the portfolio whatsoever. I think we’ll do some, but I think it’s good to put that down as a marker, the $1.96. About $500 million or so in acquisitions and to put that in perspective, in the last five years, I think we’ve bought obviously $188 million this year, but as high as $770 million. So we thought that was a pretty good range. It, I think, also assumes a conservative re-lease schedule on the 3.1% of the assets that are not leased right now. Also on lease rollover is only about 3% of the portfolios rolling over next year. However, two thirds of those rolls are a second-time roll, where the existing tenant, at a very profitable store, stayed in the first time the lease rolled and typically those tend to be pretty easy. So we don’t foresee a significant problem there. Anyway, that’s our best estimate, I think, for the moment, which I hope is helpful for everybody’s modeling. We’ll obviously see what unfolds in 2009 and watch the portfolio. To summarize, then our portfolio’s in relatively decent shape. We think that’ll continue through the fourth quarter. We’re being patient with acquisitions. We have the balance sheet to buy, and obviously nothing to deal with on that front. And our core FFO continues to grow, albeit slowly and we anticipate that that will be the case into the future, although it is certainly a very challenging market out there in retail, and we’re well aware of that. So with those comments, we will open it up to questions at this time and if anybody would like to ask us something, we’d be happy to do that. Andrew, if you can handle that for us?
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator instructions) We’ll take the first question from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: Hi, it’s Greg Schweitzer, I’m here with Michael. This one’s probably for Paul. What occupancy expectation for the full year are you baking into the ‘09 guidance range?
Paul Meurer: We do take into consideration that there might be some additional stress, if you will, in the portfolio. As kind of a general comment, I’d say about 1% occupancy down is something that’s already in those numbers and those assumptions.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: How would that compare to when you were at this point last year; deciding on ‘08 occupancy and when you made the ‘08 plan were you sort of also baking in sort of a decline there?
Paul Meurer: Something similar, maybe a little bit less, maybe half of a percentage point, or that sort of thing, at that point, but there’s always something like that baked in just as a more of a conservative view in the model and at this point in time, it seems prudent certainly to have something in there as part of the viewpoint for how the portfolio might perform and that would mean, what, 96% occupancy or similar. What have you, instead of 97%?
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: Right.
Tom Lewis: It may not be as conservative as it has been in previous year, given the market we’re talking about.
Paul Meurer: No and then of course, if it’s a little bit more than that, but yet we do some acquisitions, then obviously, we’re still in that range in terms of earnings performance.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: Okay and then Tom, just touching on Buffets to get your thoughts, we had disappointing September sales clearly and the default on the loan. How shall we think about the situation?
Tom Lewis: It’s an interesting one. I’m not overly concerned. I’ll mention we’re on the Creditors Committee and subject to confidentiality agreements and the reorganization is likely not to be completed till early next year. So I’ll give you some color on it, but relative to parsing that while it’s still going on and we’re in committee is something we can’t do. They filed last January. We had 116 properties; we got 12 back. They were about 7.6% of rents in our largest tenant and we took the 12 back and went off on those, and really started focusing on the 104 properties that we own. And as we mentioned three months ago now or so, or four months, the agreement we put together with Buffets is to lease all of the 104 properties and adjust the rent from a little over $22 million to a little over $19 million, or about 87% of previous rent. That agreement was signed by all parties; it was approved by the court and we’re operating under that in the fourth quarter and I think it was pretty consistent with what we thought and it’s also what we had in the guidance, so that really didn’t change guidance. Our thought on Buffets, as we worked through, even though their EBITDA declined substantially post their merger, there was still a lot of EBITDA in the chain, and it was going to be a reorganization. And while we had some properties that had been, I think, substantially weakened in their operations, we had mostly profitable properties and we knew that they would want those profitable properties and we felt, given the level of EBITDA, that they would go forward, and we continue to think that today. It’s interesting, as we looked at it. One of the goals we had, as we look at a case like this and it changes from market conditions, and certainly we have interesting market conditions today is that what’s going to cause us to continue to get paid rent, like we’re getting paid the majority of it today, is that they have high EBITDA cash flow coverage of the rent. We also are focused in working on this that we wanted to keep the vast majority of the properties occupied. We don’t always do that, but given what we were seeing coming through the year with market conditions, we thought that was a good idea. So we broke the portfolio down for us into the current profitability, and then tried to adjust the rents on the weaker units and we did that in return for shortening some lease lengths on it and basically, what it did for us is it got the cash flow coverages on the units we owned back up into a very comfortable level that we normally like to underwrite at, and left them in a situation where the properties we had were profitable. So I think there are some things they have to go through here in completing the reorganization. Our belief is they’ll come out, our belief is there’s enough EBITDA where the company will be out and operating and I think now, if you look at our properties all the way up and down the portfolio, we have good operations in them. So my sense is obviously, we prefer not to go through one of these, particularly since it was our largest tenant and it was a rather large integration of M&A that didn’t work. I’ll also tell you that I think their customer was kind of a poster child for what’s been going on in the economy, and also the middle line was hit with some increasing costs. But if we can go through that and maintain over the vast majority, 80%-plus of the rent we had in, and then end up back with cash flow coverages. For those of you that follow us we are in very attractive levels, and come out of it with the stores occupied, we’re pretty pleased with that and my sense is we’ll move forward with that and that we won’t have a lot of issues in the future.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: How much could sales come down for the cash flow coverage range to be at the point where you start to get concerned, on the properties in the portfolio?
Tom Lewis: In the confidentiality agreements, the only thing I could speak to was rent levels and terms, but saying that we want the cash flow coverages in levels we’re comfortable with – for those of you that watched the underwriting in recent years, I think you know where those levels are and obviously that would take a substantial decrease.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: Okay and then just finally, are you able to provide some color on the revised lease lengths?
Tom Lewis: Yes, sure. They vary. We cut the portfolio up into pieces with them and on that, I’ll give it to you exactly, here we go.
Paul Meurer: And by the way, before he answers, Greg, just so you know, the expiration schedule that’s currently in our press release now and will be in our 10-Q, and of course on a go-forward basis, does reflect all of these changes that were made to the Buffets lease plan.
Michael Bilerman – Citigroup: And Paul, it's Michael Bilerman, that takes effect as of October 1 or at what point in the fourth quarter?
Paul Meurer: It’s September 15.
Tom Lewis: We reflected that in the numbers at the end of the quarter relative to cash flow coverages, and also the lease rollover. Anyway, of the 104, we had 15 of them where we cut the rents pretty substantially and went to a three-year lease, but again, putting the cash flow coverages up into a very comfortable range didn’t bother us that much. We had 11 that we did at five-year, we had 34 at seven-year, we had 10 we did 10-year leases, and we had 34 where we did 13-year leases and again, the focus for us is – if you get the cash flow coverage very high, then lease length is not your issue.
Greg Schweitzer – Citigroup: Right, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll move to our next question from the line of Todd Lukasik with Morningstar. Please go ahead.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Hi, thanks for taking my questions.
Tom Lewis: Hey, Todd.
Paul Meurer: Hey, Todd.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Hi. Just seems like you guys have some dry powder to potentially take advantage of some good deals in the acquisition space. Can you just speak a little bit about what metrics you all will use to know when cap rates have gone high enough?
Tom Lewis: That’s a great question and like most decisions, rather than rely on one thing, there are a number of things, but I think, given what I talked about in historical cap rates, I think we’re really going to need them up over 10, so that’s one. Second, at the same time that they need to be up over 10, I think that it’d be smart for us to be a little more stringent with our cash flow coverages. So if you’re raising the rent a bit, the properties have to be more profitable to be up at 2.5 to three times cash flow coverage. So I think it’s really a mix of cap, and as well as a price adjustment in a seller’s mind, relative to where prices have to be, but my sense is 10-plus. The other part of this is in net lease. While our leases do grow, we have to make a good spread right up front. So I think if you look at your cap rate, and then you start looking at cost of capital, I think it shows you that cap rates do need to be high before it makes sense to make accretive acquisitions. If you look at debt costs for us today, BBB spreads have gapped out. In the REIT world, I think you’re over 10%. If you look at preferred, obviously that market’s been beaten up pretty bad, so you’re looking at 12%. So you kind of look for permanent financing in the common equity area and I think if you take the guidance we have for 2008 as an example, and you did $1.82 to $1.84, and you divided that by the price of the stock at $21, a price of the equity around there on a nominal basis, if you then mark it up for underwriting costs, you’re going to be looking at 9% or so as a cost of equity. And so I think you really have to be looking at a spread of 100 basis points before it makes sense to add accretive acquisitions. So it’s one, the market relative to cap, which I think has to be 10-plus. I think it’s then secondarily making sure that in this environment, which will be volatile for a few years and a tough financing market for people for a few years – we make sure that cash flow coverages are even higher than they were before and then it’ll be a look just personally at our company, and I think for anybody else in the business, at what point is it accretive enough on a nominal basis over your cost of capital where it makes sense.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Okay and can you talk a little bit about the process that you go through internally? Do you guys proactively go out and look for attractive property portfolios and approach the current owners or is it mainly reactive, where people are coming to you with opportunities?
Tom Lewis: It’s a mix of the two, but if it’s reactive, it’s because we have a list of close to 1,000 retailers, and a lot of owners and our people are out really acting like investment bankers and calling on those people, and talking to them about their portfolio, first of all, but also talking to them about their business plans and their balance sheets and their sources of capital and the majority of the transactions really come from those discussions, either through, gee, that’s interesting, let’s take a look at it; or, after having talked to the guy for five years, he wakes up and says, gee, the debt market’s no good, I’m going to need to use my real estate to get some capital, and we get that call. So I would say it’s almost all a function of being fairly proactive, calling on people and we’ve tried to be knowledgeable in terms of who’s asset-rich and who has portfolios. We’ve also tried to be proactive relative to understanding people’s debt maturities that are coming up. In our industry, there was a lot of net lease financing that was done in the CMBS market over the last five to seven years and a lot of those were five-year floaters. So they’re going to be coming up in ‘09, ‘10 and ‘11 and I think, unless the capital markets change dramatically relative to access and even if they do, they probably won’t get back to the pricing of a few years ago that sale leaseback may end up being more attractive to them than the spreads they’re going to experience as they see in the CMBS market. So we’ve been proactive calling on people. That’s where it comes from, but I think a lot of it’ll come from refinance in the next few years, versus M&A, where it came the last few years.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Okay and it sounds like you may even expect more opportunities than sort of the $0.5 billion that you’ve said might be available next year. Do you have a sense, from your own balance sheet, what other funding opportunities might be available to you all to take advantage of even more potential acquisitions?
Tom Lewis: There’ve been a lot of things used in the last few years in the REIT business to fund capital for growth and I think one of the things that has served us better than anything is keeping a very uncomplicated balance sheet and so I think it’s primarily going to be through some asset recycling and it would be through issuance of additional securities, where it’s accretive to do so. The credit facility, the $355 million, has no balance on it, and we don’t anticipate it’s going to have a balance on it in the near future. So that’s available to buy properties, but I think before you put a lot on a credit line today, it would be very wise to know what your takeout’s going to be and I think that’s going to be asset recycling and issuance of new securities, if they’re profitable.
Paul Meurer: And Todd, just to be clear, in terms of opportunity our historic track record has been more in the 10% to 15% range, in terms of what we purchase, of opportunities, not only that we hear about but really look at and underwrite, so that those are opportunities that are looked at internally through our Investment Committee, where we do the real estate work, the credit work, the cash flow coverage work. So when we say $500 million next year, to do that, we’d end up having to look at a whole lot more than that. Because we continue to be pretty stringent on opportunities we close on and make the final decision on relative to purchase. Activity levels and opportunities, I would say, has slowed down a bit, but it is still strong, and we are still looking at lots of opportunities. We clearly have seen cap rate movement, but we don’t think the volume, as Tom mentioned, will really tick back up again until people kind of get over the sticker shock, if you will, and realize that the alternatives available to them, from a refinancing or recapitalization perspective, are quite limited. And while the debt product historically was our big competitor whether that be CMBS, high-yield debt, leveraged loan or bank credit facilities. That competitor has largely completely disappeared for the BB retailer. Or if it’s there, it’s very, very expensive. So equity sale leaseback capital will be attractive to them and make a lot of sense and when you start talking 10%, 11% equity sale leaseback capital to a BB retailer who doesn’t have a lot of other alternatives relative to their balance sheet, it’s still a very attractive alternative to them. Once they get over that hump, start realizing that they’re not quite there yet, but once they do, we think we’ll have a lot of activity to look at.
Tom Lewis: I’ll just make one more comment. I would assume on the low side of the range and until we see that movement and then, we’ll guide up in future quarters if it should be. So if I was doing what you’re doing, I’d assume right in the midline, and understand it could be lower than that.
Todd Lukasik – Morningstar: Right, okay, that’s very helpful. Thanks again for taking my questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Suneet Parikh [ph], Banc of America Securities.
Suneet Parikh – Banc of America Securities: Hi, I’m here with Dustin as well. The question is given that you’re partially in the business of helping to extract real estate value from retailers then, there’s been some talk in the market about trying to do that with one large public big-box retailer in particular. Could you provide maybe your thoughts on this type of strategy to create liquidity for a retailer in an environment when underlying real estate values are so much in question?
Tom Lewis: That’s a great question, and I’ll speak generically. I’m aware of the one you’re thinking of, but my sense is, is the move to extract value out of the retailer to give further value to the equity holders and to do so by forming a REIT today is something that I think was talked about a lot a few years ago, and done, and a piece of financial engineering in a very well-capitalized market that might make sense. In this market, if you’re going to extract "value" out of the real estate portfolio in this environment, if I was running a retailer, it would be to make sure I’m solving a problem relative to my balance sheet, and stay as liquid and with the biggest margins I can, because it’s certainly a tough market out there. And then the second part is how that would be valued in the market, obviously, as it was discussed in the press, would be a decent structure, but it would be only one tenant and even if you look at REITs today and you’re doing this every day, and look at the valuations they’re getting perhaps the value extraction might not be as high as somebody thinks, but for a retailer who’s got a financing problem, I think that’s where you step up to it today, or you want to build cash, unless you’ve got something compelling to do with the business. But I think in most businesses, it’s probably not a period when huge CapEx investments are going to generate a lot of incremental revenue. It’s a better time to take care of your balance sheet.
Suneet Parikh – Banc of America Securities: Sure and then, I guess, then just as a follow-up on that. Where do you think, I guess, a ground lease for a well-capitalized big-box retailer would trade right now?
Tom Lewis: You know, I could have probably given you a really good answer six months ago or 12 months ago, and I think it would have been down in the sixes, but today, it could be substantially higher and I think if you just take a look at our yield and look at the balance sheet, and kind of run through the implied cap rate there, you’d maybe take 100 basis points off for it and then understand your standard deviation on that guess may be 200 basis points. I apologize for not being that helpful in this market.
Suneet Parikh – Banc of America Securities: No, that’s fine and I guess, lastly I guess your troubled-tenant watch list – has there been any changes? Has your watch list maybe increased? And I’m sure you look at rent coverage ratios for your troubled tenants. How’s that been going? Have they gone down?
Tom Lewis: It’s interesting; the watch list today has a couple of retailers on it. They’re not huge positions for us; they’re small and there’s nothing imminent and like all of you, I know it’s a difficult market out there, and it’s difficult for the retailers, particularly those that have a lot of debt and I think for those, their primary problem is their debt; it’s not their real estate and so some of them may well have to deal with that. But it’s not expanded as fast as I thought it would. It’s not large and if I go back six or eight months ago, it looks about the same as it did then. And I think cash flow coverages again in the portfolio are like 2.7, and they range from 1.7 to 4.55. So you can assume that if we have somebody that’s on the watch list, my sense is they’d probably be at the 1.7 to 2.1 at the lower end of that range.
Paul Meurer: We try to make some pretty affirmative statements on these calls every quarter, as a good form of disclosure, relative to our tenant base. Because we recognize that we don’t disclose specific tenant names for competitive business reasons. So let me just say a couple more things beyond what Tom said in his call remarks at the beginning. That is, in our top 20, we don’t have any other retailers in bankruptcy. So when you get down beyond our top 20 tenants, now you’re getting down to about 1% of rent. So that’s just kind of an affirmative statement that might be helpful to a lot of folks out there wondering about our portfolio.
Tom Lewis: I’ll also just want to say, so people know we know. Obviously, the economic position is not positive out there. There’s a lack of credit available, you’ve got an over-levered, worried consumer, who’s worrying about his house and equity portfolio declines. Consumer debt’s high, credit cards are tough; while gas price and food inflation has come off at bit, which is certainly helpful. That’s really offset by a low consumer confidence level. So I think for a lot of retailers, you need to dig in your heels and operate well, and watch your CapEx and your balance sheet and retail sales were up about 1.2% September. I think it’ll be worse in October, and then we’ll have to see. So with that said, though, with high cash flow coverages, we hear noise and complaints from tenants, but there’s nothing that I can say today, gee, I think in the second quarter, X is going to happen, or Y, but it’s a market also where we know that things can change, but for right now, not bad.
Suneet Parikh – Banc of America Securities: All right, that’s it from me, thanks.
Operator: Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Craig Kucera with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Steve Redona – BB&T Capital Markets: Yeah hi, good afternoon. This is actually –
Paul Meurer: Hey, Craig.
Steve Redona – BB&T Capital Markets: This is Steve Redona, for Craig. On the C-store acquisition, albeit it was a small one, is that pricing, the 10/1, is that indicative of what you’re seeing now or was this more or less a distress situation?
Tom Lewis: That’s what we’re telling them it’s going to take and so this was a situation, actually, with an existing tenant, who had another property they wanted to get done and we had done business with them and we said, look, that’s the new rate and it’s just a poster child. We just say, look at the spread on our 10-year, and look at how much it’s moved and so the fact that we’re moving you up 130 basis points is really still pretty much of a bargain and if you don’t need to do it, and you think things will get better, then hang out and wait, but our advice is that cap rates will go up before they go down and again, it’s really anecdotal, because it was a one-off, but they felt that was the easiest thing to do for the one property. We’ve had a couple other three people come in the door and the discussions have been up in that range, or maybe even higher, but I think it has been to date some challenged credits, where even at a higher rate, it didn’t meet some of the other pieces of the puzzle, but that’s where we’re quoting.
Craig Kucera – BB&T Capital Markets: Okay and then on the sales, the 13 sales in the quarter, do you have kind of a blended cap rate on those?
Tom Lewis: Yes. It was 7.9%.
Craig Kucera – BB&T Capital Markets: 7.9%.
Tom Lewis: Obviously lower than you’ve seen on sales in the past, but it was lightening up on what were some attractive properties, smaller price point, in good markets, which I think over the last quarter there was still a pretty good market in that and I think I would look for higher cap rates on sale and not put that in your model.
Craig Kucera – BB&T Capital Markets: Okay. And then just broadly, what industries are you seeing the best risk-adjusted returns right now? Are you still taking a look at any banks, sale leasebacks there and if you can just talk sort of through your major industries there?
Paul Meurer: You could send us a list of which banks you think are perfectly safe, and get a look at that sector.
Paul Meurer: As Tom’s grabbing his notes here, let me just make a comment on this, which is that banks or not banks, but it’s really going to be balance sheet-driven as opposed to industry-driven, relative to where the opportunities are. So we’re kind of seeing a mix, if you will, come in the door.
Tom Lewis: What Paul’s saying is I don’t think there’s an industry theme that we’re going to see. I think it’s going to be looking at each of our industries and having a view of how we feel about their business and their future, and how much they’re impacted right now by the consumer; i.e., are they are a low-price point basic human need or value that seems to be holding up? Or are they a consumer discretionary that’s not holding up, or anything home-related that’s not holding up? And we’ll start with kind of that view of whether we like them or not, but I think, to get to the cap rates we want in this environment, when these guys really aren’t trying to grow, it’s going to be balance sheet-related, and them really doing some liquidity. We’ve looked at banks. Banks are something we’ll continue to look at. About three years ago, we took one of our people and had him spend a year on banks – talked to everybody in the business, underwrite the industry, go through it and what we found out is there wasn’t a bank in America that needed any money that we could find, that was a bank in America, not the Bank of America. As such, we spent a year and didn’t do any business, but put the files away thinking there are points, albeit far between, where banks need capital and now that we’re in that, we’re starting to see portfolios come across in banks and it’s a very careful underwriting process. So I’m not particularly optimistic relative to doing large volumes there. The other challenge is if cash flow coverage at the unit level is our best metric for credit, that’s something that’s a lot more difficult to do in a bank branch than it is in other type of retail, and just from the standpoint of identifying what those are. Then more importantly, can they migrate down the street if a bank has two branches? And we believe it can migrate. So it really has to fall so heavily on the overall credit of the bank, that’s a difficult one today and then secondarily, the real estate and secondary use, which is a little better in the newer de novo type branches, but it may be a challenge to do a lot there, but we’re seeing them, and we’re looking at them.
Craig Kucera – BB&T Capital Markets: Great, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll take the next question from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wachovia Securities. Please go ahead.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: Good afternoon. Paul, in light of the fact, I think two-thirds of the people on the call work for a bank alright, (inaudible) talking here somewhere, but frankly it alludes me.
Paul Meurer: Hey, I did not mean it in that light.
Paul Meurer: Don’t write bad things about the company now because of it, please.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: Of course not. Actually, the question is historically, you guys have used an internal credit-scoring system. I guess it’s the DARTH score, I believe to score deals and determine somewhat of a baseline, I think, for an appropriate cap rate. However, with the debt markets blown out, I guess, how valuable are the conclusions there from a pricing standpoint? And I guess as a follow-up, where does your portfolio-wide DARTH score fall today on the S&P credit scale? And what sort of yield would that imply for your portfolio?
Tom Lewis: Yes. The last part of that I’m not quite sure I can answer, Jeff. It’s our DARF score that gets us to where we really think in it. I think the DARTH scores generally have held up to date. They’re higher than they were a few years ago. However, I anticipate they’re going to decline and I will tell you, of the three credit metrics we use – which is an unsecured underwriting, which is what you’re talking about – versus the real estate and cash flow coverage at a unit level, it’s the one we assign the less, I think, credence to relative to underwriting. Where that goes with yield – I mean, if you’re trying to take a cap rate to their debt spreads, obviously it’d be significantly higher. So I’m kind of struggling with a good answer here for you.
Paul Meurer: Well, let me just say this, Jeff. Similar to what you guys are doing to the REIT space, and really, I think, most investors or analysts are trying to do to any companies out there – our credit analysis has adapted to the current environment and when we’re looking at credit, what’s the first thing we do? The balance sheet. What do the debt maturities look like for the next two to three years, and are we comfortable with that? If the use of proceeds for the sale leaseback we’re talking about solve some of that problem, great, but are there additional problems beyond that in the balance sheet? And then we look at cash flow metrics. In our case, in our industry, it’s going to be payout ratio, if you will, but say, in a general corporate underwriting, it might be a fixed-charge coverage ratio type calculation. So we’re – it’s reordered, if you will, in terms of what the priority is of what we look at, whereas in the past, we might have been less concerned, if you will, about a debt maturity coming up in their balance sheet a year from now. Like sure, they’ll have access to the capital to repay that. Well, guess what? As we know, that’s not always the case and so – and certainly not the case today, and certainly not the case for a BB retailer. So I’d say that the analysis and approach we go through has naturally adapted to the current times, but in terms of the actual scoring system, it hasn’t really changed. They’re hanging in there. As Tom said, they’ll probably go down, I would guess, but in terms of our approach to credit underwriting, it’s certainly adapted to the current times.
Tom Lewis: Yes, I’d throw in BB minus as kind of the unsecured debt scoring – obviously we own the real estate and don’t own their equity debt converts, credit default swaps, or whatever securities out there.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: And then, I’m curious – I guess it’s a follow-up to an earlier question on banks. You know 12 to 24 months ago, banks were sort of maybe the hot tenant, if you will. The margin that – they were paying top-dollar rents, and there’s top-dollar pricing for their assets. I’m curious where that has gone. Because you said a year or two ago, none of the banks really wanted or needed money. Could you argue that now, in this environment, they definitely want capital? And has TARP effectively provided some degree of a government backstop or cushion that you could argue that this is an industry that’s sort of back on its heels, or a group of creditors that are back on their heels a little bit, but at the end of the day, their credit’s actually better than it appears?
Tom Lewis: Maybe. With the regional banks – or the ones that have been coming in the door are the local banks and I’ll tell you, we’ve looked at a number of them and a part of our underwriting requires that we get into their portfolio, and we get into the portfolio, and we start looking at the real estate and the real estate development loans, and backing residential homebuilders and the rest of us – quite frankly, in a number of them, we just threw up our hands in the middle of the underwriting and said we’re not smart enough to do this at this juncture. And the people that are not in that situation and are really backed by TARP and the bigger banks – it just would have to be a decision to build liquidity, but I don’t think the cap rate’s going to be in a range where we would do it right now.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: Okay and I guess, just last question – point of clarification – the low end of your $1.86 guidance next year – that includes the $0.05 of investment sale gains, correct?
Paul Meurer: No. We’ve never included property gains – sales gains in our –
Tom Lewis: No.
Paul Meurer: – numbers.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: Okay. I wasn’t sure. Just, when I was reading through your –
Paul Meurer: No, just Crest and Crest essentially is estimated, to be honest, at 0 next year.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: Okay.
Paul Meurer: We say 0 to 1, just put something in there, but its 0.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: Okay. And then, I’m curious – how plausible is it that you could actually face a year-over-year decline in FFO? Or maybe, what sort of magnitude of occupancy decline would you need to make that a reality?
Tom Lewis: Well, there’s a lot of moving parts to it, and no acquisitions and we have 1% growth in the portfolio. I’m just doing the math in my head. Then it would take a – and we’ve built about 100 BPs decline in occupancy into the model.
Unidentified Speaker: Already.
Tom Lewis: So I would say, why don’t you start at a couple hundred BPs, 300, to see some decline, but –
Paul Meurer: I think at that point, Jeff – if I could say this – and I don’t mean it cavalierly – Realty Income might not be the company you’re going to be worried about under that scenario. It’s going to be a pretty significant issue in the economy and I tend to think, on a relative basis, we’ll still be hanging in there pretty well.
Tom Lewis: Yes, but I think you just take – you take the bottom end of the range and understand we got a 100 BP decline in there, and you see the number it gets it – and it’s all core; there’s no crest. So it’s easy to do and then you can start working some numbers.
Jeff Donnelly – Wachovia Securities: Okay, and thanks. Oh, sorry, before I meant $0.01, not $0.05. Thanks, guys.
Tom Lewis: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We’ll move to the next question from the line of Ryan Levinson [ph] with Private Fund [ph]. Please go ahead.
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund: Thanks for taking my question. My first one is, I think you just said these numbers, but I was busy talking to somebody and missed them. The kind of the portfolio leverage numbers that you used that range of EBITDA to lease coverage?
Tom Lewis: Yes.
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund: Just repeat that?
Tom Lewis: Yes, sure, I will. When we’re in the portfolio for the quarter, the top 15 tenants – and this is EBITDAR, the "R" being rent – to rent was 2.79 times on average on the stores we own in our top tenants, top 15 tenants. The lowest tenant was a 1.7, the highest, 4.55. And typically, I think if you look back over the last five, six, seven years, we’re a company that has liked a 2.5 times coverage and it would really vary industry to industry, but when you get down to 1.5, we’re getting uncomfortable. So it’s really like a 2-plus is what we’re looking for. And then obviously, the higher the coverage, better and that goes up as, hopefully, EBITDAR goes up over time. So we’re really looking at about 2.5, and when we go and do an acquire and in the past, I would say there were a few transactions where there’d be a couple properties that might get down to a 1.6, 1.7 – I would say and something we’re doing today, we’d be a lot less patient with having a cash flow coverage under 2 at all and we’d want the transaction overall to be 2.5 to 3 times, I would think.
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund: Okay and so that’s just EBITDAR to rent.
Tom Lewis: Right.
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund: Given that you’re dealing with all less-than-investment-grade credits, they’re all leveraged – what is EBITDAR to rent plus interest?
Tom Lewis: The EBITDAR to rent is what we look at on a unit basis. When we do our underwriting for the tenant, we do a full unsecured underwriting and there are many, many metrics, of which that’s one and primarily, what we’re looking for somebody is that we think – we just start by saying that we’ve got a business that is a low-price point basic human needs and it’s something that their product’s going to be used over a long period of time, that there’s a lot of EBITDAR. So if they ever had a problem by overleveraging the balance sheet – that it’ll be a Chapter 11, and not a Chapter 7 and then we really go and focus on cash flow coverage at the unit level to survive that type of event, and real estate prices, so if we ever get a unit back, then we’d have a decent chance of leasing it. But then it ranges all over the board, and I’ll give you an example. In 2000, when all the theater companies were having a significant problem, we walked into one that we knew was going to do a Chapter 11 in about three months, and really structured a transaction where we looked at a group of their movie theaters that were very profitable, and then we bought the land under them at very high cash flow coverages and so we were happy, knowing we had a tenant who might do an 11, to go in and underwrite that. Conversely, we’ve been in situations with a tenant that we think has a business that’s a little more volatile and we’ve required that just their balance sheet would be in better shape. But I’ll give you our lessons of 39 years and that is we own properties for 10 to 20 years – we don’t own securities and during that 10 to 20 years, it has been our experience the balance sheet will change, management will change, that industry will go through a downturn, it will go through an upturn. And while we do all of that work, it’s really centered around that it’s a business that we think has a large amount of sustainable EBITDAR over a long period of time, but we are not underwriting to a corporate credit to make sure we get paid. It’s more centered on the individual units we own, the real estate price, and then the assumption if they ever have a problem, it’s an 11. The other caveat I’ll put on that on EBITDAR is it various dramatically, from tenant to tenant, to industry and industry. Because obviously, different tenants have different margins and different industries have very different fixed costs. So if you’re taking a look at a movie theater, and you have a two-times coverage, it would take close to a 40% decline in revenue to take it to a one-to-one coverage. If you were looking at a department store when we underwrote a Boscov’s or a Gottschalks but didn’t do anything, our sense was a 2.0 coverage only took about a 9.8% drop in revenue to get to a one-to-one coverage. So it varies dramatically from industry to industry and tenant to tenant.
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund: And I understand that. I guess what I’m just trying to understand is – across the portfolio, and this is the EBITDAR-to-rent number, I think, tells only part of the picture and I’m just interested –
Paul Meurer: We stand in front of the interest expense in a bankruptcy scenario. So we’re in front of the debt-holders, if you will. If we have a positive cash flow EBITDAR-to-rent property that’s cash flow-positive, they need to accept the leases to keep those properties, to generate cash flow to pay the debt-holders. So we stand in front of that. So we, on some level, really don’t care, meaning yes, we look at how leveraged a credit might be, and don’t want them, in a best-case scenario, to go into bankruptcy, but, if you will, at the same time, you should assume most of the BB retailers we do business with are generally going to be leveraged. I mean, they’ve been leveraged for 39 years. They’re hitting a pretty bad cycle right now, over the past couple years, combined with some operating metric downturns. But in terms of the leverage element, that’s nothing new and so that’s why we don’t kind of add that into our calculation. Now we do – as Tom said, when we do credit underwriting, to make sure, from a fixed-charge coverage ratio, that they’re cash flow-positive. We certainly don’t want them to be not being able to pay their interest expense and make money as an entity. But we also assume that over the course of a 10-year, 15-year, 20-year lease, they’ll probably take on more leverage than even what we’re looking at upfront in our underwriting.
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund: I’m just a little perplexed by something. How do your leases – is there a provision written that some sort of document that works with your creditors, with your tenants’ creditors as well, that puts the leases ahead? Or are you just saying, kind of notionally, that if they want to stay in the building that they have to accept the terms of your lease? I don’t – because I think the mechanics of it –
Paul Meurer: It's your latter comment.
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund: Okay.
Tom Lewis: That is –
Paul Meurer: Chapter 11, right.
Tom Lewis: What happens – in an 11, obviously the equity-holders typically get wiped out. The debt-holders have their position markedly changed and very often, they end up the equity-holders primarily and that happens in a Chapter 11. You then go to what happens to the real estate – and it’s pretty simple – is they either want to keep the unit, or they don’t want to keep the unit and that is going to be based on their profitability and the way we measure that is EBITDAR divided by rent. So if it’s 2.5 times, that means for every buck of rent, they’re making $2.50 EBITDAR, and their choice is pretty clear. They can A, reject the lease, in which case we get the building back. We have our asset and our risk as what we can rent to somebody else versus them – or they can accept it. If they accept it, then we have had no credit event. So if you have a substantially cash flow-positive property, that is what happens to it because they have to have the stores to sell their goods to generate their EBITDA and they can’t have it without paying rent. And I think if you look at Buffets, that was a very good example. Here’s a tenant that had an M&A that they struggled through their top line, really got hit, their middle line really got hit; all of those three things happened at once. It was our largest tenant. We had 116 properties. We got 12 back immediately that we’re out re-renting and then on the balance, the majority of them had no rent change whatsoever and overall, we maintained 87% of the rent on that portfolio. So that’s kind of how it works.
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund: Okay. Let me just switch gears, if I could. I’m just curious. On the guidance, the $1.86 to $1.96, there’s nothing for Crest, but where does the growth come from? I know you have some modest escalations built into some of the leases, but if you have 100 BPs of a decline in occupancy, what’s more than offsetting that?
Tom Lewis: Well, we have lower G&A, which you saw in this quarter and we anticipate will continue. That’s primarily a function of compensation of the lower level of activity and outside of that, and maybe something else –
Paul Meurer: We had same-store rent growth, we had free cash flow.
Tom Lewis: If you’re 40% levered, which I guess if you add debt and preferred, and you have one –
Paul Meurer: Our interest expense is going to go down pretty significantly –
Tom Lewis: – 1.1% to 1.3% growth, then that gets up around 2%.
Paul Meurer: Our interest expense is going to go down pretty significantly after we pay off the bonds.
Tom Lewis: And the balance is acquisitions.
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund: Okay. So – pardon me – and so acquisitions gets you to the $1.96; no acquisitions gets you the $1.86?
Paul Meurer: Correct.
Tom Lewis: Correct.
Ryan Levinson – Private Fund: Okay. All right, thanks a lot.
Tom Lewis: Thanks, Ryan.
Paul Meurer: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Martin with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Philip Martin – Cantor Fitzgerald: Good afternoon.
Paul Meurer: Hey, Philip.
Philip Martin – Cantor Fitzgerald: I guess my only question – a lot of them have been answered – but how will Crest impact your ability to go after and take advantage of opportunities, I guess, along the risk curve in 2009? I mean, for example, an opportunity may present itself that may combine a higher-risk, less desirable – or that may contain higher-risk or less desirable assets, but this might occur before Crest’s business really comes back. So, I guess how do you manage that and balance that?
Tom Lewis: I can answer that, Philip. If you go back two years ago, when we were – last eight years, when we were using Crest a lot, I’ll make a blanket comment that cash was a commodity, and property was valuable. And as such, the person selling the property to a number of people who had cash in a competitive environment was able to put into a number of properties that may not have hit where you wanted to underwrite to, or secondarily, it may be a large enough portfolio where you needed out of diversification by selling off. Today, that has completely flip-flopped, where I think properties are a bit of a commodity and cash is what’s valuable. For somebody looking for cash, it’s a very different market. We competed primarily with a 1031 tax-deferred exchange market that really bought the bulk of all net lease properties out there and that market has just shut down; it’s just really declining extraordinarily fast, as the people in that market, A, either don’t need a 1031, because they’re not selling properties at profit; or B, can’t get their financing. And then secondarily, because other forms of financing have been dramatically impacted because the spread expansion in the debt markets, or the shutdown of the CMBS – I think we’re in a situation today where there’s a dearth of buyers who have cash and there are a number of sellers out there and I think next year that there’s going to be a dramatic number of sellers and not a lot of buyers. So the answer is, if we had to use Crest, it’d be no. If they want to put in some properties we don’t want to buy, we’d take them out and it’s just a very different market.
Philip Martin – Cantor Fitzgerald: Then you just have the negotiating leverage, obviously, to do that in this market with – okay. Okay.
Tom Lewis: And that’s what I – and that’s what it is and I anticipate, but don’t know for sure that we’re going to kind of sit back here in the fourth quarter. We’re looking at transactions and if we find the right one, we’ll do it. But my sense is it’s going to be coming in the next year, when the reality for a lot of folks – who are just hoping with all their might that the credit markets come back – capital markets come back – that reality will impede, and there’ll be a lot of properties out there. If – look, if credit comes running back in, and the world is just great, and interest rates go low, and equities go high, then you’re back into a situation where you could probably use Crest again, and I guess we would, but I’d be amazed if that happens.
Philip Martin – Cantor Fitzgerald: If that happens, okay. Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Management, at this time, I’d like to turn the conference to you for any closing remarks.
Tom Lewis: Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. As always, it’s a busy earnings season, and there’s a lot of complicated things going on and we appreciate the coverage and the support and appreciate your attention. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will conclude today’s teleconference. We do thank you for your participation and for using ACT Teleconferencing. You may now disconnect, and please have a pleasant afternoon.

Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Call. During today's presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions). This conference is being recorded today, July 31st, 2008. Now I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Please go ahead, Sir.
Tom Lewis: Thank you very much and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our conference call, where we'll talk about the second quarter and a little bit about what's going in the balance of the year. In the room with me today is Gary Malino, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Pfeiffer, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel; and as always, Tere Miller, our Vice President of Corporate Communication. And as I am obligated to do on each call, during this conference call we'll make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in the forward-looking statements and we'll disclose in greater detail on the company's quarterly 10-Q, the factors that may cause such differences. And, Paul, if you want to go ahead and walk through the quarter, well do that.
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Tom. As usual I am going to comment on our financial statements and provide a few key highlights of the financial results for the past quarter and start with the income statement. Total revenue increased 17.2% for the second quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2007. Rental revenue increased to approximately $82.4 million in the quarter, as a result, of course, of new property acquisitions. Same store rental revenue increased 1.4% for the quarterly period. And other income was only $80,000 for the quarter. On the expense side, interest expense increased by $10.9 million, during the second quarter, as compared to the second quarter of last year. And this increase, of course, due to more bonds outstanding as compared to a year ago, specifically the $550 million of 2019 notes that we issued in September of 2007. We had zero borrowings on our credit facility throughout the second quarter. On a related note, our interest coverage ratio continues to be strong at 3.2 times, while our fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.5 times. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by about $4.5 million in the comparative quarterly period, as depreciation expense has increased, of course, as the portfolio continues to grow. General and administrative expenses for the second quarter were about $5.9 million, representing only 7.2% of total revenues for the quarter. We continued to expect G&A expenses in 2008 to remain at or below 2007 levels. Property expenses increased slightly on a comparative basis by $135,000 for the quarter. These expenses are primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance and insurance expenses, which we are responsible for on properties available for lease. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company; and these taxes totaled $218,000 for the quarterly period. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter was $4.7 million. Real estate acquired for resale refers to the operations of Crest Net Lease, our subsidiary that acquires and resells properties. Crest sold seven properties for $28.6 million during the quarter for a gain on sale of $1.7 million. However, Crest also recorded an impairment of $953,000, on one Buffets property held for sale. You will recall that Crest holds three Buffets properties. We impaired two of those properties last quarter. This is the third Buffets property, and this impairment amount was already in our internal projections, which we gave out last quarter, when we updated earnings guidance at that time. Overall for the quarter, Crest contributed income of $1.295 million. Real estate held for investment refers to property sales by Realty Income from our existing core portfolio. We sold eight properties during the second quarter, resulting overall in income of $3.4 million. These property sales gains are not included in our funds from operations. Preferred stock cash dividends remained at about $6.1 million for the quarter. Net income available to common stockholders was approximately $27 million for the quarter. Funds from operations or FFO, was approximately $46.8 million for the quarter. FFO per share was $0.47 per share versus $0.49 per share a year ago. However our FFO before Crest contribution or the FFO from our core portfolio increased to $0.45 from $0.44 per share a year ago, an increase of 2.3% in earnings from our core portfolio. When we file our 10-Q, we will again provide information you need to compute our adjusted funds from operations or AFFO, for our actual cash available for distribution and dividends. Our AFFO or CAD is typically higher than our FFO, as our capital expenditures are relatively low and we don't have a lot of straight line rent. Our continued growth in core earnings allowed us to continue increase in our monthly dividend this quarter. In June, we increased the dividend for the 43rd consecutive quarter and the 49th increase for the dividend overall, since we went public over 13 years ago. Our current monthly dividend is now $0.138 per share, which equates to a current annualized amount of $1.656 per share. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a very conservative capital structure. Our debt to total market capitalization is 33% and our preferred stock outstanding represents 8% from our capital structure. In May, importantly, we recast our credit facility, increasing it in size to $355 million, plus a $100 million accordion expansion feature. The initial term of this facility is three years, plus two one-year extension options thereafter. We strongly felt that in this challenging market environment, recasting the new facility was a lot more prudent than simply exercising the one-year extension option, which we did have available to us on the prior facility. We were very, very pleased with the responsiveness of our bank relationships and the speed with which we were able to syndicate this new facility back in May. We continue to have zero borrowings on this facility, however, at this time. Furthermore as noted on the balance sheet, we also have over $39 million of cash on hand. In November 2008, as many of you know, we have $100 million of bonds coming due and in January '09, another $20 million of bonds coming due. As we said previously we plan to reserve cash or credit facility capacity for this $120 million of upcoming obligations, so that we are not dependent on positive public capital market conditions at that time. Thereafter our next debt maturity isn't until 2013. So, we do not need to access any new capital for any upcoming financing obligations. In summary, we currently have excellent liquidity and our overall balance sheet remains healthy and safe. Now let me turn the call back over to Tom, who'll give you more background on all of these results.
Tom Lewis: Thank you, Paul. Let me start with the portfolio. As you saw in the release, we ended the quarter with 96.8% occupancy and 75 properties available for lease out of the 2,367, we own. That's off about 60 basis points from last quarter on occupancy. 13 of the new vacancies were from credit default from a couple of small tenants this quarter. That is not a large number, given we have almost 2400 properties. But its an increase nevertheless, but is consistent with what we expected and actually what we included in the guidance that we gave last quarter. And then the balance was just normal leased rollover, that's going on in the portfolio and ebbs and flows. Our sense is occupancy should rise a bit from this level, the balance of the year. We see good activity in the portfolio management department and releasing space, and don't have anything pending relative to additional vacancy that's not reflected in our guidance. So, things look just about what we thought they would, a few months ago and I would be a bit surprised if occupancy wasn't in the 96% to 97% range, the balance of the year absent anything material from what we see today. You'll notice, we announced in a press release a couple of weeks ago, an agreement with Buffets to continue to lease all of the 104 properties, we currently have leased to them in our core portfolio. And that the rent would be adjusted from $22.4 million to $19.4 million or about 87% of previous rents. That announcement was generated by a filing at the court that, we had reached an agreement with Buffets. And in response to a number of calls we got after that, we thought it was appropriate to put out that information of what the financial impact would be, so people could see what that was. We had planned, by the way to do that at the end of the third quarter. When we could sit down and talk more about it, which we can't do today. So that will be the extent of my comments on the Buffets situation. As I've mentioned before, relative to that agreement specifically we are under a confidentiality agreement. And then secondarily as their process is underway, the reorganization is quite active. We are also on the Creditors' Committee and have a confidentiality agreement subject to that as you would assume. And so, we anticipate no significant news out of that situation in the near future. I will say though that, that agreement was consistent with what we were looking at last quarter and once again with guidance. Relative to the balance of the portfolio, I think as everybody knows out there listening into some other calls. The retail environment is weak overall. And it's obviously a very difficult environment, particularly in the last six to eight weeks for the consumer. We can see that in the operations of our tenants and the discussions we have with them, also in the underwriting of new transactions, which we continue to do. And while we can see some stress in some very small positions we have with some retailers. We would really be surprised by some substantial additional vacancies coming in, over the next quarter though. So nothing really new, we have nothing else significantly going on in our top 20 tenants. We are currently reviewing those, for a meeting we have with the board every August. So, we are in the midst of re-underwriting and talking to them. And quite frankly, when you get down to below the top 20 tenants, you are looking at about 2% of rents. Same-store rents on our core portfolio increased a little under 1.5%, during the second quarter and for that year-to-date. Looking forward to the balance of the year, we would see same-store rent increases probably at about that level, and so continued increase. If you look at the 30 different retail sectors that we have in the portfolio, there were two that had declining same-store rents, four had flat same-store rents and there were some increases in the balance of the 24 different industries. But it was really concentrated on and I guess you'd expect this because there are larger industries with about half of the increases coming from restaurants, childcare, auto service, and C-stores. We continue to be well diversified in the portfolio. We had a decrease of about eight properties, totally in the portfolio from quarter-to-quarter from 2,375 to 2,367. That's really coming from the sale of a number of properties out of the restaurant industry that we used to prune our position there and just slightly reduce overall and just acquiring one property during the quarter. We continue to be in 30 different retail industries in the portfolio. We have 118 different retail chains and continue to be in 49 states. Relative to exposures to various industries, restaurant is our largest industry. At quarter's end, it was at 21.7% of revenue, down from about 23.9% in the second quarter and from about 24.2% at the end of the fourth quarter. That's a reduction of a couple hundred basis points over the last 90 days or so. And as we've said over the last couple of quarters, we are full in that industry not making acquisitions. We are selling off a few properties and going to get that back down under 20%. Convenience stores are about 16% of revenue. The next largest industry after that is, feeders at 9, which is down a little bit from 10%, and then childcare, which is at about 7.5% and from there it goes down pretty quickly. We continue to be mindful of diversification in the portfolio, one would like to keep it well diversified. If you look from a tenant standpoint, our largest tenant as we said in our past press release was Buffets at about 5.9% of rent. The next largest tenant about 5.3% and then every other tenant is below 5% of revenue. Our 15 largest tenants comprise about 54% of revenue today. And just as a data point, when you get to number 15, you are at about 2.2% of revenue. And to take it, when you get to tenant number 21, you are at about 1.4%, and again, it goes down very quickly after that. So, we remain pretty well diversified. The average remaining lease length in the portfolio continues to be a healthy 13 years. And that's really staying longer as a function of acquisitions over the last year or so, and then secondarily from releasing properties that are coming up and obviously having a longer lease than right before they expire. I mentioned our top 15 tenants comprise about 54% of revenue. As always, our best metric for credit remains the cash flow coverage of rent at the store level, or the individual stores cash flow to their retailer or the EBITDAR, if you will, divided by the rent he pays. And the average cash flow coverage for our largest 15 tenants on a store basis. EBITDAR coverage of rent was 2.7 times at the end of the second quarter and ranged from a low of about 1.7 times up to about 455. That's off a bit from last quarter, where it was 2.76 and ranged from 188 to 419. But 2.7 times, that's obviously very, very healthy. And we believe gives us an excellent margin of safety relative to the tenant's ability to pay his rent and if they own very profitable property. So we own their profitable properties. Let me move onto property acquisitions. During the second quarter, we only bought one property for $2.7 million. That was one we had really worked on over the at the in the fourth quarter of last year, that crept into the second quarter of this year, so effectively, we really didn't buy anything in the second quarter, which is what we had expected to do. We continue to have $250 million in acquisitions for the year for our guidance, but with $184 million done today certainly hitting the $250 million number for the year is doable. While we didn't buy anything during the second quarter, we continue to look at a lot of transactions. From time-to-time, I'll put these numbers out to give you a feel. Year-to-date in committee, we've gone through just under about $2 billion worth of transactions that we've looked at and underwritten. About 61 separate transactions and again, buying about 188 million in eight transactions, we bought about 9% of what went through committee. To put that in perspective for the same period a year ago, that is off a fair amount from what was coming through the committee as we see less transactions generally in the marketplace overall. I think if you look at the acquisition environments today and you start really on the demand side, the number, you start with the 1031 tax-deferred exchange size of the business that tends to be a fairly large part of the net lease market. And the number of those type of borrowers, which has been very big, I think has declined quite a bit, as you see sales and other property categories declining, which means there are less gains that need to be sheltered through a 1031. And our people that kind of watch that area think the transaction volume is probably down about 50% in the 1031 market over the last 18 months, relative to net lease properties. Having generally buyers out there that are looking at that type of property are having a harder time finding financing, if they don't have a lot of equity to put into properties. Obviously, the CMBS market is quiet out there and then secondarily, the regional banks but its still some of the lending gaps in recent years, are running into their own areas. And I think financing is a little harder for them to get. We took a look recently at all of the properties from kind of the 1031 people out there that were listed on the market for sale. And we just made notes that probably about two thirds of them had been on the market for 90 days or longer. So, I think that the inventory is aging a bit and that 1031 market slowing down. Relative to the segment that we primarily play in, which is kind of the larger portfolio buyers, I think that slowed down a bit too. I think most of the people who bought in bulk to then flipped have exited the market, usually through capital issues having trouble accessing capital. I think there is a lot less other institutions out trying to buy today and a few like us are on the sidelines, waiting for cap rates to move higher. From the supply side, obviously, there's less M&A related activity out there that would generate these. And that's brought the volume down overall. And then I think just generically, like a lot of real estate sectors, the bid/ask spread out in the net lease market between buyers and sellers was pretty large. And unless owners today are compelled to do a transaction, they are trying to hold out for an improvement in the market at some point and hope cap rates will fall from where they are today. From our perspective, I think prices are declining and cap rates are continuing the increase. I think on the larger transactions we've looked at, my sense is, they're moving up into the high 8's, and maybe the low 9's, and continue to move up. But there's really not a large volume of transactions being done out there right now. It's interesting relative to caps, its kind of hard to know exactly where caps are in both transactions because if you look what was reported in second quarter numbers, that's pretty much looking back about 60 days or so into the marketplace. And as we've all seen both at the general retail environment, and I think that's true in the property market cap rates that are 60, 90 days old are a bit stale. And so, it's hard to get a feel on it, but we definitely think that they are moving higher. I also don't think that you are going to see transactions pickup very much for a while. I think there are lot of people out there that don't have access to other forms of financing, they do have real estate on their books. And at some point, they are going to have to enter the market. I think they are hoping that the credit markets will open up and allow them to access other forms of capital and our sense that it will be difficult to do that. However I think that most of bad volume that comes on the market will probably be late in the year or early into 2009 and that as that happens if that happens you are likely to see cap rates move up a fair amount. That will close the bid/ask spread I would think and probably cause volumes to pick up. I think for '08, though we are going to stick with the $250 million number and subject to change depending on how cap rates and seeing what else is going on out there. As Paul mentioned, we are very liquid at the moment. There's no balance on the line. We have just about $40 million in cash sitting around and some property sales and free cash flow coming through. We are very liquid and I'd like to stay that way and intend to stay that way for a while, until there is some definite movement upwards in cap rates and volumes. And then at that point we may put some of the money to work, but not until. Let me move onto Crest Net Lease for a moment. Most of you know that Crest is our business that we've had the last eight years that helps us buy large portfolios for the core portfolio, where we'll buy some, put them in Crest and then sell them so we can work down our concentration. It has been a moneymaker for us, but as we always say, obviously a very different quality of cash-flow because its cash flow is generated from property sales, which is a lot more volatile. And for perspective, Crest is made in any given year, over the last eight years between $0.02 to $0.11 per share so, it has been a fairly small part of our overall FFO and remains so today. Last year we did $0.11 a share in Crest, which was a function of having a lot of inventory and a lot of sales last year. Our inventory in Crest peaked last year at about $140 million and we have been paring inventory through sales over the last year or so. We've bought nothing in Crest at five of the last six quarters and the last three quarters, we've made no purchases at all and have really been trying to wind down that activity. Current inventory at the end of the quarter was only eight properties for a little over $10 million. Close to the end of the quarter, we sold another property, have two more under contract, which really leaves us with only five properties in the Crest portfolio with the inventory of about $6 million. Three of which are the Buffets, that Paul referred to, that have been substantially impaired. But I don't think there is any risk there relative to valuation and then two small properties that I anticipate no problem selling. So, with inventory at only about $6 million, we are affectively out of that business and until we need Crest for acquisition purposes, or the market really changes, I doubt seriously that you'll see any additional activity going on in Crest. As I mentioned in the past, we are in a very competitive market with a lot of buying. Crest was very helpful to buy large portfolios with a reduced kind of number of competitors out there over the last year or so, we haven't had to use Crest and our sense is at the current time that that's really where we see the risk of holding a lot of inventory in a rising cap rate environment and we are happy to effectively be out of that business today. Moving on to dividends, as Paul mentioned, we've continued to increase the dividend. I'd anticipate and would look for dividend growth to continue here in 2008 and absent anything, material also 2009. Relative to FFO obviously, the number was $0.40 versus $0.49, most of that had to do with closing Crest down, having a penny come out of Crest this quarter versus $0.04 a year ago. On the core contribution pre-quest, we grew from about $0.44 to $0.45 per share in core FFO, which is up a little over 2%. Relative to guidance, there is no change to the guidance from last quarter and we'll stay at $1.84 to $1.90. That includes only a penny or two from Crest versus $0.11 a year ago. And then our expectation, that the core before Crest will grow at 2% to 5% this year. As we start to think about 2009, I think looking into next year, the numbers we issued have Crest washed out of those numbers. I think we should release a fair part of what's on the vacancy list, and I'd anticipate to be positioned to have a pretty good 2009, relative to FFO growth. We will put guidance for 2009, at the end of the third quarter and is our, as we're accustom to doing at that point, we'll lay out all of the assumptions relative to the portfolio operations Crest and acquisitions at that time. To summarize them, I think the portfolio is in relatively good shape, given the state of the overall markets, we're effectively out of the Crest business, being very patient with acquisitions and holding off here for higher cap rate, balance sheet is good, liquidity is good and core operations continue to grow and we think that'll continue through the balance of the year. All of which, I can say I can live with in this type of market, which is certainly interesting. And I think, that'll wrap up our comments and I appreciate the patience to kind of go through everything. And operator, at this time, we can open up for questions. That will be great.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan: Well, thanks Good afternoon.
Tom Lewis: Hi Tony.
Paul Meurer: Hi Tony.
Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan: With respect to the deal pipeline in any of your acquisition targets for the full year. Just what's the visibility for what's remaining on the $250 million, since, it sounds you all are going to be pretty patient with the cap rates to move up.
Paul Meurer: Yeah it'll interesting, I don't think we are going to buy much of anything here in the third quarter. We continue to underwrite transactions. It was really absent something coming in, where I think cap rates might be as we get in the next year. We'll probably remain very patient and then it is a question of, whether later in the year not cap rates really rise. So, my sense if we miss anything here this year, its really on the acquisitions, but those would have been later in the third quarter or fourth quarter, I think from a model perspective and really have very little of any impact on '08 and then we'll update that relative to its impact on '09 as we do guidance for next year, which we think will be positive. So, it's really hard to say at this point, it'd be very easy to pull the trigger. We had a number of transactions come through in the mid to high 8s. In the second quarter and I think that'll happen in the third and again unless something comes in the mid 9's or so, given, effectively the nominal cost of capital is up around eight unless you can get into the mid 9's. I have bit of trouble trying to allocate that capital at an inadequate spread. So, my sense is if we do it'll be towards at the end of the year, Tony. And it wouldn't surprise me at all to do it or exceed it, but wouldn't surprise me all to be a little under it.
Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan: Okay. So, is mid 9s kind of the spot that you think things should go to at this point or would reflect kind of a fair pricing in your minds, where you people are more interested?
Paul Meurer: Yeah I think that's where it would be and maybe even a little higher. Obviously, every transaction is specific relative to the bump that you are getting on the leases but that's probably into the range.
Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan: Okay. Is there any particular industry type that you are seeing more deal for in at the moment or not?
Tom Lewis: It's pretty wide ranging. There is not a big theme, which normally, I think, if you go back about four, five years, I should say we are seeing a seen a lot of restaurants or C stores. But we are really seeing diverse group of things coming off and typically it's somebody who's got a decent size piece on the balance sheet. They're becoming a little more rationalized relative to where the capital markets are and looking at where spreads have gone, the credit spreads and they are saying, I am going to need to do something for my balance sheet in late '08 or in '09 and have decided that the market may not get better and they are coming to the market. And I think because of that, it's less of a industry theme than it overall is a balance sheet theme and now I wouldn't be surprised if that continues.
Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan: Okay. And then, with respect to you C store exposure. Can you talk to how those properties are performing in light of just considerably relative to gas and the other sort of business?
Tom Lewis: Yeah. We have been watching C store and obviously that's a big story with gas prices. I know one of the public C store chains we know well, reported and I think kind of 4, 5 takeaways from listening to their conference call. Say what we are hearing from pretty much everybody which is gallons are up probably about 4% or 5% over a year ago. Gas margins have come down $0.03 or $0.04 and are probably around $0.09 to $0.12, first being $0.03 to $0.04 higher from that a year ago. I think where most of them are getting pinched which is something you normally wouldn't look for as credit card piece because even if you maintain the number of fence, you are maintaining your margin yet. Credit card fees obviously are a function of prices, and with higher gas prices they are getting pinched a little bit there. It's really been hitting their middle line. And so that I think has been almost as hard on them as the reduction in gallon is. Where they make their money inside? Most of them were saying they're off maybe 2%, 3%, 4% inside sales which is not as bad and in this particular one today, the merchandised margin was relatively flat. And then if you look at net income, it was off probably about 20% quarter-over-quarter a year. But you can take that other way off 20 or maintaining 80% of it. So while there is some stress and a slowdown, which I can see, I think you can see in a lot of retail today, that one is another one of the postal charges a function of gas prices but still not as bad as you might anticipate, just more talked about.
Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan: Okay. And last question. do you have any sense as to maybe what percentage of your tenants or revenue base have a parent that's bankrupt at the moment, that kind of say even though your stores are worked out, the parent is still bankrupt, is there any way to gauge that?
Tom Lewis: You know I haven't run that number but if I had to do that I'd say 7. If I have to guess, the phase is 59 you know.
Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan: Yeah. If you take away the phase', your looking at less than 1%?
Tom Lewis: Yeah.
Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan: How much of that?
Tom Lewis: There is really not much else in there at the moment.
Anthony Paolone - JPMorgan: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [Andy] here with Michael. Could you give some color on the 13 credit default assets that you had with those tenants in any specific industries than who are you really seeing those assets to?
Tom Lewis: Yeah. Well they've just come offline and again they were only 13 and few of them are restaurant and one was the general merchandise. But again you are looking 13 properties out of 2367. So, it's a very small number and we knew those were coming last quarter and we also put them in the guidance and then really its obviously, its going to be restaurant and the other, I think its 12 restaurants, small restaurants and one box and the box is near a mall and can be released to just about anybody.
Unidentified Analyst: And have you found it more challenging to release spaces given softer restaurant operation?
Tom Lewis: I really want to say yes, but I can tell you also that we've had a pretty good flurry of activity recently through those, so I'm not sure that's the case. But I would certainly expect if it hasn't been in the last four or five weeks and its been fairly strong, it will turn around and be worse because as I said in the last call, we have really, we normally use six months to really space and we widened that to nine and I'd still stick with that.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And then on the reset of the rents for the phase I, when does that hit?
Tom Lewis: That has not hit as of yet, but again I'm going to demeanor from anything else beyond that, that's pending but I just wanted to get out there, the agreement. From a modeling standpoint, I think we're late enough in the year and it's a small enough part of our rents which won't be material.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then on, I'm not sure what you can say on this, but some of the lease terms were changed though they were cut down the lease term. When are we going to be able to get color on the changes in the lease structure [purposes]?
Tom Lewis: At some future date, when they are through with the reorganization.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And then on the change in the coverage that you mentioned is the drop off on the bottom end, is that related to any specific industry or sector or any trends that you are seeing in your cash flow coverage's?
Paul Meurer: No. that was with one particular tenant, and I looked at that and again, its one out of I think 15, and that tenant was I think 1.2% of rent. They had a rent coverage during the quarter ago from 188 to [17], so it wasn't huge. There was, I think, in the previous quarter, the top end was 488 and it came down to about 452. So, funny enough, thankfully, most of the reduction we saw was at the upper end of the strata of the change of the really strong stores.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Donnelly, Wachovia Securities. Please go ahead 
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: Good afternoon, guys.
Tom Lewis: Hi Jeff
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: Paul, I was just picking up on earlier question, I get the sense that you guys never mind, that we are nearly, anything I guess, whose appear to have continued to stress in retailing, can you share those, I guess, the two or three factors that you think are going to bear the brunt of may be, future chapter 7/11 filings and conversely those that you might think come clean and avoid that?
Paul Meurer: I don't know who comes clean, I think restaurants, but I think they've already seen a lot of the stress. And so, that's an obvious one, people are talking about. The convenient store chains, while we've seen their numbers come up, it's a basic human needs business and unless there is really they are heavily levered. I think there are on a okay shape for now and when you get beyond that. I think the poster child is kind of the traditional hard and soft good retailers that you see out there. And I think one of the reasons we feel little bit better about what we're doing is that's a very small part of our business. I think about 19% of our revenue comes from traditional hard and soft good retailers. And I think that's where you're going to see some of the stress out there. But as you know pretty broad based out there right now and I think its going to be more balance sheet related than its going to be industry specific. I think, to date, it has been industry specific, looking at restaurant and seeing kind of casual dining get hit, as people traded down in fast food benefit, while the upper sit down dinner house, did just fine and I think now the more aspirational shopper, the guy out on the credit card that has the good job, just starting to step back a bit and then I think it goes pretty broad-based and maybe moves a little bit more into the upper tier that it has been where its been kind of the really low end Wal-Mart consumer.
Tom Lewis: And I think Jeff, this is Tom saying. When you are seeing the hard/soft good retailers it's more the discretionary spending which you know is not kind of a the new spin we are creating in this environment talk about our portfolio, but it's always how we talked about the stuff we are trying to buy where you have the consumer who really needs or enjoys the service that they otherwise can't get easily or can't make a discretionary decision on. So electronics stores, things that are a little bit more difficult to imagine in this environment, people maybe not waiting a bit, taking a year to buy the new refrigerator what have you and those are the kind of retailers we have always tried to avoid significantly in the portfolio and that's what's given us a pretty good comfort at the moment.
Paul Meurer: Let me Jeff, I was talking through this evidence, pulled something out my book here that I have where we kind of went through. I miss spoke, it's about 15.5% typical hard and soft good and I have a little thing in here that we talk about which who is doing great, who is doing okay, and who is weak? I'll just run through them in the typical hard and soft goods. I have this great nobody. I have this okay drug craft and novelty and then I really have is kind of a weak general merchandise apparel, books, consumer, grocery anything home related home furnishing, office, supply, supporting goods and that's a small part of our portfolio. Relative to kind of hard and soft goods with services, who is doing? Auto parts, is actually doing very well. Who is doing okay? Tyre stores kind of the business services at the low end. The weaker obviously are restaurants, motor vehicles, travel plazas, video, home improvement and that's there is really nothing imminent I see there but that said. And then up in services, I'd say great financial services to small position we have there, those guys are doing really well. Health and fitness continues to do really well. Okay and theaters there is slightly up in box-office this year, childcare, auto service and collision. And then the only thing I have got weak in services is equipment rental. So, that's kind of our laundry list.
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: Actually you are drilling there for a second, auto just generally half of the category has been suddenly declining across, I think in all categories last few years. Is there anything specific driving that and then I noticed that I think in the last quarter you guys entered into an area called distribution/office. And I was just curious exactly what that was?
Paul Meurer: Yeah, I'll do the first one second, second one third and the fourth one eight. The first part is relative to and I forgot all three parts of the question.
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: Distribution office is the first one.
Paul Meurer: Yeah. Distribution in office as we've done larger transactions. Occasionally they've had a distribution facility or two with it and in almost all most cases what we've done is going out and reached out to somebody else who wants to own distribution in office and we own a couple distribution facilities that were part of a couple transactions that we thought were very well located and that they had to have and then I think we own one office building which is the office of a retail tenant, that we did a larger transaction with but it's a fairly small part of revenue.
Tom Lewis: And then auto Jeff, I think is driven by obviously new auto sales, it's obvious why people maybe slowing down the purchases there. Secondly, maybe little bit less driving to try to conserve on gas, but most of the stuff we are involved in is the auto parts, auto service, auto collision repair, potentially you have to do if you got to get it from your job. And they would prefer to put a few dollars in to keep the old car running rather than to go buy a new one. So, that's kind of where our focus has been.
Paul Meurer: Yeah. Parts is doing very well and I would just have to guess, if you look to tire and you looked at service and you looked at collision and if miles driven in May was off 3.7%, which I think is what the NTSP said. Then maybe and I don't know, you could assume that they'd see a little bit of softness on the top-line. But those are pretty steady businesses and the decline in autos, obviously been kind of a dealership business.
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: The response from most of you guys, have been selling out of those, as it is you've been just growing elsewhere in the lost chair of your portfolio?
Paul Meurer: Yeah, exactly.
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: And nothing (inaudible) the call, but if I could just ask a few questions about your cap rate assumptions, 8 to 9, throughout. Was that on single asset deals or both portfolios?
Tom Lewis: That's both portfolios. You know as I said the ones transactions we've done this year, we've been watching and we watched them go from the mid 8's to the high 8's and then we're actually having some people say, we could into the long 9's, but either through cap rate. But also underwriting they didn't get there. So my sense, they are creeping up there. If you look at the individual one off, as I think I talked about last quarter, if you got a good brand, small price point, million bucks and you are in a good market, you can probably creep in around 7 today, up from the high 6s but that's even migrating up from there. I think those are 60 day ago comps and those are moving up into the mid 7s. But when you get into the secondary market, secondary brands and when your price point gets up around $2 million, $3 million, $4 million, I think you are starting to see low cap rates move. Price point, it's really has to do with financing, but I just think the market spending out and there is less buyers.
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: And I guess can you tell us, I guess my last question, what metrics are you look for to know that we've hit a bottom and it's safe for you guys to start treading into the market again or acquisitions and I guess maybe related to that is, why 8 to 9, I guess what are you looking at to derive that?
Tom Lewis: You know I don't think for us to step back in it's 8 to 9. That's just where I have been seeing the high 8's to low 9's as the stuff that's coming through but there is kind of two things going on. If it's in the high 8's, the low 9's and I think it's going to decline, which I do because I think we live in Escondido here and you know where that is and its kind of one of the ground zeros, for what happened in the housing marketing. And when housing started to decline here obviously, what happened is transaction volume just went away, as the sellers didn't want to sell at a lower price and the buyers were demanding a lower. And so you want through this period of six, eight months where all of a sudden inventory started going up pretty dramatically and then very slowly people who had the sales started selling and you saw prices go down and then over the next six to eight months, that just cascaded. And we saw that clearly during the housing market, but I could a draw parallel, kind of in the net lease business because I really think there are lot of people out there generically in the capital markets who have balance sheets that are going to be need to be refinanced and they are going to need to be refinanced substantially higher rate and then there are some people who I don't think are going to be able to get the financing they want and real estates one of their alternatives. But I also think they are all, there is a lot of people that are really just don't believe what's going on are hoping it'll get better and they are sitting around and not moving and waiting till they have to. And so my sense is, if that happens and its an if, but I think a reasonable possibility towards the end of the year and in the next, you just, at that point cap rates are really moved because the guys that can step in with the large amount of capital, I think are more limited and I think there'll be larger transactions charter underwrite and I don't think there'll be a lot of players. So, I think cap rates will move, if not if I'm wrong on that, my sense is, we retained a very high degree of liquidity in an interesting credit market. We missed a couple of quarters of acquisitions and life won't end.
Jeff Donnelly - Wachovia Securities: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Fick with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus: Paul, first of all congratulations on the financings, most of my questions have been asked. One general question following up on your assumption that you are going to see better deals, or you hope to see better deals as people don't have financing alternatives. I don't want to imply that you are saying that you're a financier of last resort, but you're taking corporate credit in a declining economy. And I'm just wondering how separate from the cap rate conversation, what are the disciplines you're using in credit committee to make these kind of calls?
Tom Lewis: That's a million dollar question. It's a great question. I think the first thing is obviously, what we've been really eyeing is cash flow coverage during this, as we talk to our tenants. On our portfolio, to gauge how quickly they are moving and while our numbers that I quote every quarter which is the top 15 as we are looking backward number. What we've tried to do lately, as we're doing underwriting, may be in the past, we would have said, at this point in a year show me your '07 numbers, show me your '06 numbers and see if you can get me an update, to underwrite that. We are now saying, show me your last 12 months trailing and quite frankly, I don't really care about and what's these big seasonal adjustments, the 6 months from the back end to that, I want to see your last 8 weeks, and what you're hearing from your stores. I think we're really tightening up the number we're trying to use for cash flow coverage's and then if we were looking for a 2.5 in the past, I'd say, we'd be looking for 2 and 3 quarters and a 3 today, because as always, it's margin of safety. And then it'd be really trying to focus in, on the real estate side of the risk and not get too far away from replacement cost and then just be mindful of their industry. We're not doing any restaurants, but an example, might be if we were doing upper end restaurants and you look at their trailing 12 months and the numbers look just fantastic which some of them do. I think if you look at the last 6 to 8 weeks and their numbers, you'd be looking at, it really declining and I would say that you may see it decline quite a bit more. So industry specifically, I think we'd be careful. So in this, we're going to have a higher cash flow coverage. We don't want to get away too far from replacement cost and then we just want to think too carefully where they are going. But at this point not buying anything, we haven't had to do that.
Paul Meurer: You know, David I would add that on the credit analysis piece of it. Just as we mentioned that people needing to refinance things coming due on a liability side of their balance sheet might be a driver for us of opportunities to invest as a financier or choice within that might be one of the last remaining choices form. Similar to that, as we are looking at the balance sheet and underwriting the credit of these retailers, we're looking out over the next handful of years to see what other refinancing is going to happen in there, because as there will be in Corporate America, in general there's going to be a refinancing issue that's going to happen, that's really going to strip a lot of earnings power out of lot of balance sheet and that's true for all of us if you will relative to how much low price that is sitting in those balance sheets. I assume you guys do the same kind of work yourselves if you are looking at the read. So that part of our analysis this is a kind of new and interesting one as well if you are looking at a retailer today. We actually kind of look at that 2010, 2011 maturity that sitting there at 5.5%. We know it's not going to be 5.5% when it gets refinanced. So we do a little re-jiggering and pro forma work just to kind of understand earnings. We've got 20 or investments here. So it's something we take of kind of longer term approach.
David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. We look forward to hearing more about lets say next quarter. Thanks guys.
Operator: Okay. Thank you. Our next question is from the line of [Eric Rothman] with Danske Securities. Please go ahead.
Eric Rothman - Danske Securities: Yeah. Good afternoon. I was curious given that most of your leases are tighter CPI for [bonds]. And given the dramatic increase in the CPI over the last several quarters, why have your central rents kind of not followed a similar trajectory. Basically, kind of where has been forever, should we expect to see higher same-store NOI growth or same-store rent growth , given dramatically higher CPI.
Tom Lewis: I think down the line maybe a little, but I'll backup in this, and try to give a history of leases and you go back years and years and years ago, let me start with the 70's quickly, is basically you had a base rent of percentage of sales, when you had a ton of inflation in the percentage of sales went through the roof, I can remember couple of [taco] bells we had and unit up with a 100%, the rent equally what you originally bought the thing for and the retailers all woke up and said wait a minute, I want to put that breakpoint really high and the lease is written for the next five years had a percentage sales or something at them they went flat. So, what happened is people started doing 1% to 2% increases, but normally they even did 8% to 10% increases every five years. What we've always done is put in there, that the rent will go up at a couple of times CPI not to exceed than every five. And we did that for a lot of years and then about three, four years ago, we went to a thing that said, it'll go up at two times CPI not to exceed 2% every year. So, we're starting to see more annual increases in the portfolio for same store rent, I think we'll rise a bit maybe not the balance of this year, but in the next year and the year after. But I don't think its just going to be CPI because we do not have unrestricted CPI, we just have a CPI calculation and how we do the getting to the 2%.
Eric Rothman - Danske Securities: Alright great, thank you very much that's very helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Philip Martin, with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald: Good afternoon, everybody. 
Tom Lewis: Hey, Philip.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald: Just a couple of quick questions, first of all to what extent are you having discussions with your tenants and probably the stronger tenants in the portfolio, and so [adenizing] over the next 12 to 18 months as an increasing number hopefully of opportunities come up. Our tenants company, you don't wanted to talk about that strategy, are your going to them or is there no discussion taking place?
Tom Lewis: That's a great question. You would think we'd be out talking to everybody and they'd actively talking to us about how they're going to handle those, but I still and I am amazed at I think generically the people in denial about the credit situation we're in. I think most people are saying, "My gosh! Look at this. When will it get back to the way it was?" And we really view that obviously there has been an end to an era out here and credit is not going to be democratized as it has been in the past. There is likely to be have and have not and generically without securitization out there and with people being more mindful the rates are likely to be higher. But I don't think most people out there are really seeing it that way. I know talking yeah, there is. A lot of, we see the world that way, a few don't but that's the function I think of least being companies that are very active in the capital markets. And if you have companies that are in it all the time there is still either, I think most people are some what aware but in denial. So, there is not as many of those high level discussions going on as you think that there might be in that would be rational if you had.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay. And lastly and I know you've touched upon it in some of the answers and your upfront comments, but are you seeing a higher percentage of late pays in the portfolio?
Paul Meurer: We are not seeing a higher percentage of late pays in the portfolio.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay, thank you
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of [Suneet Parikh] with Banc of America Securities. Please go ahead.
Suneet Parikh - Banc of America: Hi, I'm here with Dustin Pizzo as well. Tom, even though you have close to $400 million of liquidity between cash in the line, how are you thinking about the equity markets as the source of funding here, given the probably 8 percentage to imply cap rate at which your stock is trading and the 99.5% cap rates you're targeting in acquisition especially as opportunities increased over the next few quarters?
Tom Lewis: Yeah. For the moment, we're not thinking of doing anything. I think relative to the price of the stock you want a decent price. But we really focused in and will continue to focus in on getting an adequate spread up ever, whatever capital that we issue because it increases our earnings. So if you are sitting out there and your equity cost you rate on a nominal basis which is taking a forward FFO yield and divided by the inverse of the cost to raise the capital and you take that. And if you can get a 100, 30, 40, 50 basis points above that relative to yield, then it's going to be accretive to earnings to the parties involved. We are less oriented to NAV discussion but we are mindful of equity shareholders and that we don't want to get anywhere near earnings dilution and that's why we focus on spread and also try to be mindful of what points people have entered the stock past in offerings.
Suneet Parikh - Banc of America: All right, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of David Wellington with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
David Wellington - Merrill Lynch: Hey guys, how are you doing?
Tom Lewis: Good, David.
David Wellington - Merrill Lynch: Sort of quick question. I think you though typically don't miss the individual franchise properties. Just curious if you have seen a difference in the performance say of the franchise portfolio the 2 versus say some of the larger regional national chains?
Tom Lewis: If we ran something, we might even say at this point franchise is doing better. But that's only because of the franchise we have in here have 600 or 800 or 1000 units and they are very big and those few that we have are generally doing pretty well. It was interesting that I was in a major restaurant chain the other night, that's not in our portfolio and then there is a guy I know, who opens new stores for and then sees their numbers and they both have corporate and franchise. And it was interesting to note from his perspective, he's just been to a meeting in the franchise stores, was substantially outperforming the corporate. And I thought it really interesting and he said that he had heard that in a couple of other chains and he felt it was a function of a fair amount of management chains and stress, put on the corporate side to move people around to get performance, first a franchisee that have stable management and that's anecdotal in nature. But within our portfolio, I don't think there is really much of a differential because we don't have much in franchise, but it was an interesting comment from this guy.
David Wellington - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, we have no further questions. Mr. Lewis, please continue with any closing remark.
Tom Lewis: All right, thank you very much everybody. I appreciate the participation and I know it's a busy season and it's an interesting world and we look forward to talking to you in the future. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Realty Income second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. We thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-05-02 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by, and welcome to the Realty Income first quarter 2008 Earnings Call. During today's presentation all parties will be in a listen-only mode, and following the presentation the conference will be open for question and answers. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, May 1st of 2008. I will now like to turn the call over to, Tom Lewis, CEO, of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.
Tom Lewis: Thank you, Michael. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. Our purpose is to review the first quarter operations, and give you some color for the balance of the year. With me in the room today is, Gary Malino, our President, Chief Operating Officer, Paul Meurer, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Michael Pfeiffer, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel, and Tere Miller, our Vice President, Corporate Communications. And as always, I am obligated to say that during this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in the forward-looking statements, and we will disclose in greater detail in the Company's quarterly 10-Q, the factors that may cause such differences. And as we always do, we'll have Paul start, and kind of do an overview of the numbers. Paul?
Paul Meurer: Thanks, Tom. As usual, I'm going to comment on the financial statements, provide a few highlights of our results for the first quarter, and start with the income statement. Total revenue increased 17% for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2007. Rental revenue increased to just under $82 million in the quarter, primarily as a result of new property acquisitions. On an annualized basis, our current total rental revenues are now approximately $330 million. Same store rental revenue increased 1.5% for the quarterly period, and other income was approximately $1.5 million for the quarter. On the expense side, interest expense increased by about $11 million during the quarter as compared to the first quarter of last year, and this of course was due to more bonds outstanding as compared to a year ago, specifically the $550 million of 2019 notes that we issued last September. We had zero borrowings on our credit facility throughout the first quarter. And on a related note, our interest coverage ratio continues to be strong at 3.2 times, while our fixed charge coverage ratio was 2.6 times. These numbers are a little bit lower than usual, due to the interest expense on the excess cash from our September bond offering. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by almost $4.9 million in the comparative quarterly period, as depreciation expense has increased as our portfolio continues to grow. General and administrative, or G&A, expenses for the first quarter were about $5.5 million, representing only 6.6% of total revenues for the quarter, and we continue to expect G&A expenses in 2008 to remain at or below 2007 levels. Property expenses increased on a comparative basis to just over $1.2 million for the quarter. These expenses are primarily associated with the taxes, maintenance, and insurance expenses which we are responsible for on properties available for lease. Income taxes consist of income taxes paid to various states by the Company. These taxes totaled $398,000 for the quarterly period. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter was a negative $28,000. Real estate acquired for resale refers to the operations of Crest Net Lease, our subsidiary that acquires, and resells properties. Crest sold 15 properties for $17.5 million during the quarter, for a gain on sale of $2.7 million. However Crest, also recorded impairment totaling on this $2.4 million on two properties. Overall for the quarter, Crest contributed income of negative $269,000. Real estate held for investment refers to property sales by Realty Income, from our existing core portfolio. We sold one property and some excess land during the first quarter, resulting overall in income of $241,000. Preferred stock cash dividends remained at about $6.1 million for the quarter. Net income available to common stockholders was $23.7, down from $30.3 in the first quarter of 2007. Funds from operations or FFO decreased 1.3% to just under $46 million in the quarterly period. FFO per share remained flat at $0.46 per share all of this FFO, however coming from our core portfolio, which was as increase from $0.45 from the core portfolio a year ago. When we file the 10-Q, we will again provide information you need to compute our adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or actual cash available for distribution as dividends. Our AFFO or cash available for distribution is typically higher than our FFO, as our capital expenditures are relatively low, and we don't have a lot of straight-line rent, and that was true again for this quarter. Our continued growth in core earnings allowed us to continue increasing our monthly dividend this quarter. In March we increased the dividend for the 42nd consecutive quarter and the 48th increase of the dividend overall, since we're in public over 13 years ago. Our current monthly dividend is now $13.7375 per share, which equates to a current annualized amount of $1.6485 per share. Briefly, turning to the balance sheet, we've continued to maintain a conservative capital structure, and our debt to total market cap was 33% and our preferred stock outstanding represents about 8% of our capital structure. We have zero borrowings on our $300 million credit facility as I mentioned and thus no exposure to variable rate debt. Our credit facility also has a $100 million expansion accordion feature. As we mentioned in the press release, we're currently in discussions with our bank group regarding the possible recasting of a new longer-term facility, though of course, we do have the ability to simply exercise the one-year extension option this coming November. Furthermore, our balance sheet at March 31st notes over $13 million of cash available. In November 2008, we have $100 million of bonds coming due, and in January 2009, we have another $20 million of bonds coming due. As we said on the call last quarter, we plan to reserve cash or credit facility capacity for this $120 million of obligations over the next 12 months. Thereafter, our next debt maturity isn't until 2013. So we do not need to access any new capital for any upcoming fixed financing obligations. In summary, we currently have excellent liquidity, and our overall balance sheet remains healthy and safe. Now let me turn the call back over to Tom, who will give you more background.
Tom Lewis: Thanks, Paul, and I will run through the different areas of the business. Let me start with the portfolio. As you can see in the release, we ended the quarter at 97.4% occupancy and 61 properties available for lease, out of 2375 that we own in the portfolio; that's off about 50 basis points from the last quarter. 15 of the new vacancies came from credit default from a couple of tenants. That's not a significantly large number, given that we have almost 2400 properties, but it's an increase nevertheless. I think everybody is aware of the Buffets filing involving 116 of the properties that we own, that today comprises about 6.7% of our rents. We are in the middle right now of working on that and negotiating and it will continue to unfold. We believe we'll be able to give everybody pretty much a full report probably on the second quarter conference call, perhaps on the third, but hopefully the second. And then, we can report I think with a lot of clarity as to exactly what happened, where the revenue stream ends up, what we got back and where we see it being leased. I think overall, relative to Buffets, their business continues to be challenged by the economic headwinds. And while we believe that we own profitable properties with Buffets, I think it's safe to say the margin of safety that we had has been eroded somewhat, but we continue to believe the vast majority are profitable. That will probably impact what we thought we would be receiving from Buffets somewhat. But we've built that into the guidance which you see here, and that is not the total reason for the change. We will have some brief commentary in the Q that will disclose that. They have rejected 14 of our properties. I think most of you have made note of that. 12 are from our core portfolio, two that we will hold in Crest, and I will talk about that a bit later. And outside of that, they are current with their rent through April on the balance of the properties we own. And as I mentioned on those 12, we've built that into our guidance. Again, the negotiation is going on with Buffets, so I don't want to say too much publicly at this time which might hamper our ability to do what we want to relative to that negotiation. I'll also mention that the court has given them an extension from May 21, which was the initial date from which they had to make all their decisions relative to the real estate, to August 19. That 90-day extension is part of the law and not unusual for that to have happened. But since we're working with them at this point, I would anticipate that perhaps we can get through what we're going to do before that date comes, and then obviously be able to report back on a pretty straightforward basis as to what happened. And again, we've captured what we think will happen in our guidance. Same store rent on the portfolio during the quarter increased a nice 1.5% versus 1.2% for the fourth quarter, so up about 30 basis points. Of the 30 different industries we have in the portfolio, one had declining same store rents, four had flat same store rents, and 25 saw some type of same store rent increases. About half of the increases came from just a few industries, with the majority of that coming, strangely enough in this environment, from restaurants, and then the balance from childcare, auto service and convenience stores. We continue to diversify the portfolio. We're up, as I mentioned, to 2375 properties, 30 industries, 119 retail chains in 49 states. And during the quarter, we added another 106 properties with eight different retailers. As to industry exposure, restaurants are the largest industry. It's at 23.7%, down from 24.2% for the fourth quarter. And as we said in our year end call, we are full in that industry segment and have stepped back, and you'll now see that number begin to fall as we add in another areas, and also do a few sales in that area, not a large amount, but a few. Convenience stores are next at about 14.3%; that's down pretty continually over the last three, four years. And then after that, theaters were about 8.8% down from about 10% a year or two ago. Child care is down to 7.7%, for those of you that have watched the Company for a long time, that's down substantially over recent years. And we continue to be mindful of diversification in the portfolio. At the end of the quarter, our largest tenant is 6.7% of rent, the next largest is 5.3%, and then it goes down from there. I think if you take the 10 largest tenants for us, that's about 41% of revenue and our 15 largest today are 54% of revenue, that's down from 55% last quarter. By the way, when you get to the 15th largest tenant, you're only talking about 2.2% of revenue, and when you get past the 20th tenant you're talking about 1.3% of revenue, so it declines fairly quickly from there. So we remained fairly well diversified. The average remaining lease length on the portfolio also remains healthy. It's currently at 13.2 years, and that's been kept up, as you probably noticed, from the acquisitions this quarter having some longer lease terms, and also from leasing some of the properties that are undergoing lease rollover at the end of their initial terms into longer leases. As I mentioned, the top 15 tenants are about 54% of revenue. Our best credit metric for kind of keeping tabs on them is obviously the cash flow coverage of rent, of EBITDA at the store level individually. And at the end of the quarter, the average cash flow coverage for our 15 largest tenants on a store basis, and that's EBITD to our coverage, was about 2.7 times exactly, ranging from 1.7 to 4.55 times versus the first quarter it was 2.76 there, and ranged 1.88 to 4.19, so that's 2.7 times still. And we think, given the economic environment and kind of what's going on in retail, the portfolio is actually doing okay. Let me move on to property acquisitions. We were very active in the first quarter and invested a little over $180 million in 106 new properties. Their cap rate was 8.7%, up slightly from what we saw in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned a second ago, the average lease term was up to 20.6 years. There were eight different retailers in seven different industries, and the properties were located in 14 different states, so pretty well diversified. All of that was for the core portfolio, and none for Crest Net Lease, which I will talk about in a bit. We funded the $181 million by cash on hand that was generated from our September issuance of $550 million 12-year notes. So the cost of the capital there was about 6.77%, and we'll enjoy about 193 basis point spread on those new acquisitions, which obviously is accretive right away and should grow as time goes on. Relative to overall the acquisitions environment and what we see out there, we will continue, by the way, to use $250 million for now in guidance for acquisitions. But with $181 million in the first quarter, we should have no problem hitting that number for the year. But I do not want to increase it this quarter at this time. We continue to see a number of opportunities during the quarter in committee in underwriting. We worked on about $1.5 billion of transactions, from that we bought the $181 million. And if you pencil that out, that's about 12% of what we underwrote. By the way, for the last five, six years we've averaged about 15% hit rate on those things we underwrite, with a range of 8% to 26%. So 12% is pretty much right down the middle in terms of what we end up buying versus what we underwrite. Relative to the overall environment and kind of how, we see things for the balance of the year. If you look at the market today, I think on the demand side, for net lease properties the number of 1031 tax deferred exchanges. So that brings back the volume on that side. I think there are less large people out looking to buy portfolios. I think the people who were flipping, a lot of them have exited the market. I think other institutional institutions that we were competing against have exited the market, and then summer on the sidelines kind of waiting for cap rates to move higher. And then there is still a couple, of free people out there that are fairly active on the acquisition side. And there still are buyers out there, but volume is down a bit, and on the buy side there are some buyers out there. On the supply side, I think obviously a lot of the net lease transactions generated in the last few years were from M&A, a lot from private equity, and that's obviously declined. I think that's brought down overall volume. However, there are also sellers out there, and we continue to see transactions in the marketplace. I also think, like other sectors, the real estate market, the bid/ask spread between buyers and sellers is pretty large right now, and unless owners are really compelled to do a transaction, they are trying to hold out for lower cap rates. And I think the buyers are out there recognizing cap rates are moving and may move further and want cap rates to move up. So, generally, cap rates are heading higher, and we continue to see that pressure on the transactions that we look at, relative to where the market is, it's kind of all over, particularly when you have a lower amount of transactions. But generally, I think on larger transactions, they are creeping into the high 8s and perhaps the low 9 cap rates, seem to be moving up a bit. And for the one-off transaction out there, if you're trying to buy, it's a really interesting market because it's really bifurcated. You see there is some really good brand or tenants on the lease; if it's a low price point, say $1 million to $2 million. So getting financing from your local bank is not an issue, and it's in a good market, a good SMSA, then I think you're still looking in the low 7s for cap rates on the sale of those one-off properties, and we're seeing that in our operations. However, at the same time, if it's a secondary or tertiary brand, if the price point moves much about $2.5 million, $3 million, or if it's not in a major market, I think you've really seen cap rates move, and that can be up into the 8s or even into the 9s off one-offs. So I think it's a lot like what you see in the debt markets today, where credit spreads have widened substantially, and it's the same thing in the net lease business. It has to do with who the tenant is and their quality, if the price point is low or high, and then what market it is in. And I think that will continue for a few months. It's kind of typical when cap rates are moving up for transaction volume to slow a bit. And I think that will continue until either people who have real estate need to do transactions because they can't do financings in other parts of the capital markets, either that or if cap rates stabilize, then I think you would see the market open up. It's our view, I think, looking out over the next six to nine months that there are a lot of people with real estate on the books who currently don't have good access to other forms of capital. They are going to have capital needs that are coming upon them, and we think, probably over the next few quarters and into 2009, if the capital markets don't come back very, very strong, which I'm not sure they will, they will probably need to come to market with their product, and that will likely move cap rates up further, and close that bid/ask spread, and I think lead to some opportunities if you are out there and can buy. Either way, we think being patient right now relative to the volume makes sense and will likely pay off in higher cap rates down the road. So for now, we're going to stick with the $250 million number that we've been using, subject to change, depending on cap rates and market conditions. I will also note it's nice to have capital should we see any compelling opportunities. As we said in the release, we've got $13 million of cash on hand, no balance on the credit line of $300 million. We've got about $30 million of free cash flow coming out this year, and then about $50 million in sales between what we see in Crest and out of the core portfolio. So we continue to be pretty liquid in this environment. Let me move on to Crest Net Lease for a moment. As most of the people on the call know, Crest is our subsidiary that acquires and then immediately sells net lease properties. We started this company about eight years ago. Generally, it's been a good performer for us and is used primarily to allow us to buy large portfolios and then remain diversified by immediately selling off some of the properties. As we always say, and I think on every call since we've started it, though, it does make money, but unlike our core revenue from long-term leases, its contributions are primarily on property sales, which means it is transaction based and it ebbs and flows, pretty heavily quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. For anybody that is just been covering us for a year or two, I will give you some background on Crest. If you look back the last six years or so, in '02 Crest made about $0.04; '03, $0.06; '04, $0.10; and then $0.03 in '05, $0.02 in '06, and then we earned $0.11 a share in Crest in 2007, which was really a peak earnings year. The $0.11 was a function of having started with a lot of inventory at the beginning of the first quarter of 2007, and then obviously because of that having a lot of sales last year. We started the last year with 60 properties in inventory, about $138 million of inventory. Most of it was added in the fourth quarter of '06. We bought another $30 million in the third quarter of '07. So about $168 million of total inventory that we added in, and we've been pretty much paring that inventory down through sales over the last year. We did not buy anything in Crest in the fourth quarter and we did not buy anything in Crest in the first quarter of '08. And we plan no acquisitions in the second quarter here in '08 for Crest. Current inventory at the end of the quarter was just $31.7 million. It's comprised of only 14 properties. We have had a couple of more sales since then. We have another six properties under contract, which really leaves us only six properties available for sale. And we would like to reduce inventory to zero in Crest by the end of the second quarter or early in the third quarter, and then let Crest stand inactive for the time being unless the market changes. It's been very helpful for us in buying large portfolios, as I mentioned, and selling off the concentration, but what we found really in the fourth quarter, and again here in the first quarter is with a lot of net lease buyers gone from the market, we've been able to structure our transactions without using Crest, taking some of the properties out, while we're doing the transaction. And anticipate that will be the case for a while, given there are fewer buyers, and we do not have to use it, and we can buy portfolios without doing that. I also think with cap rates moving up that this type of business carries substantially more risk than it has over the last few years as cap rates decline. If you really look, since 2002 through 2007, when we were using Crest, we were very much in a declining cap rate environment, and it makes that business look very easy and very profitable. And as I made note of, we believe that that environment is different today and we are in a rising market. As we also noted in the press release, we impaired two properties in Crest to the tune of about $0.02 per share this quarter. These were two properties leased to Buffets that were rejected, and that I mentioned earlier and went dark. And we went through the appropriate accounting, since these assets are held for sale, to analyze the vacant value and a conservative estimate of what they would be leased at. And try and get an absolute conservative current valuation methodology, and mark those to market, which we did, and that was the $0.02. Overall, we are very pleased to have little left for sale in Crest here, and quite frankly, since it's been a small add-on to the business used primarily for acquisitions, which we don't need it for today, we're happy to be winding that down. Let me move on to dividends. As Paul mentioned, we increased the dividend in the last 42 quarters. I would anticipate we would look to continue to raise the dividend here in 2008 on a regular basis. And I'm optimistic that will continue for quite a while. And we continue to believe dividends will increase. Relative to FFO, as Paul mentioned, it was $0.46 in the first quarter versus $0.46 for the same period of a year ago. Crest Net Lease had no FFO for the quarter, based on the impairment I just discussed, that offset about $0.02 in gains in FFO from sales that we otherwise would have had. FFO before Crest's contribution, or core FFO, was up $0.01 to $0.46 from $0.45 a year ago or up about 2.2%. Obviously, absent the impairment, we would have done $0.48 a share or up 4%, which is not what we did, due to the impairment. Let me move on to guidance for a minute. We've made a change obviously, in the guidance here to $1.84 to $1.90 per share, or down about $0.10 per share from what we were previously estimating, and that's really a function of reducing Crest to an estimated $0.01 to $0.02 in FFO this year. That accounts for about $0.05 per share of the adjustment we made, and it does include the impairment we just took. We took out another $0.04 for additional anticipated vacancies. Buffets was a little bit of that over and above what we had before, but it's also a number of other properties with other tenants we expect will happen over the balance of the year, and given our view, we wanted to build that in. And then there's $0.01 in costs associated with replacing our credit facility with a new one. We are working on that as we speak, and will comment further on that probably in the form of a release, if and when we complete the process. We think the $1.84 to $1.90 is our best estimate of what will actually happen at this point. It is an estimate, and I don't believe it's reaching, nor are we low balling anything. And I would tell you, it would not surprise me at all, to hit at the low end of the range. However, I believe we could also hit the middle or the high end of the range, depending on what happens. That overall would make 2008 about a flat year for FFO growth. Our core portfolio, we anticipate, of operations will grow at about 2.2% to 6% this year. And that will be offset by the reduction in Crest that I talked about as we make it inactive. Let me talk a little bit just kind of generally about, what we're trying to do here. As we sit back today and kind of look at the results from the retailers, talk to retailers, and watch what a lot of you are watching, relative to the economy and consumers and the retailers, we really see that it's a challenging environment out there going forward and may become more challenging for the retailers and the consumers. At the same time, we also think that we're going to be in a period where cap rates are going to be rising. And given that that's our view, the question is kind of, okay, what moves do you want to make? What should we be doing differently today from what we were doing six months ago, when that view was a bit more moderate? And what we've tried to do is identify where we think the primary risks are in the business and either eliminate that risk or assume that more of that risk that we see will actually exhibit itself, and try and capture those in the numbers. And for us, that's really vacancy. We increased our assumption for credit default here. What we did is we went and looked through the portfolio, and we assumed there would be additional stress on each of the retailers we do business with for the balance of the year. Now that included a bit more, as I mentioned, for the Buffets reorganization. We then went through and did a complete review of our top 20 tenants, trying to estimate really what was out there. And that captures a lot of the rent, and as I mentioned earlier, by the way, when you get to number 21, that's like 1.3% of rent. And in the top 20, the only one we made a change on was Buffets, and we do not anticipate at this time vacancy from others that are in the top 20. We then though, took a look at those below our top 20 tenants, where we have fairly small exposures, and did some assumptions for additional vacancy for a smattering of tenants that we have small positions in. We took a few more cents for that we think will exhibit itself this year and that is what we assume will happen actually, not that it might. Most of that, and I think this is a really key point for all of us who have been looking at the Company without a lot of credit default for a long time, as we've really been supported by low interest rates and a consumer that's out there spending more than he makes. And that is, most of the lost rent is from the time it takes to retenant the property, which will fall mostly in 2008, and then we will recover a fair amount of it in 2009. When you have a default, initially in the vacancy, obviously, you receive no rent when you get the property back. And as well, you have to pay the property taxes, maintenance and insurance. And that hits you right away until the property is released in the year when you have that vacancy. And that's here in 2008, then in the following year, when you go ahead and lease that property obviously the expenses are again being paid by a tenant. And you recapture a fair amount of the hit you took that year. And that's kind of the differential we see here in '08, where whatever vacancy there is hits, and then there is recapture of it going into 2009, and I think that's kind of the key. And it was really going through that review of the tenants, adding in a little more for Buffets, and then generally assuming one more fact, which is interesting. Normally, when something goes as vacant, we anticipate that it will probably be vacant about six months. And we use that in our planning relative to rental loss and also expenses. And we thought, given where the economy is it may be a little more difficult to release. And so in our assumptions, we've adjusted that to nine months, which also has an impact. But anyway, of the $0.10 reduction, that's really where $0.04 comes from and how we're looking at it. I think the primary area of risk in the short term for the portfolio, we believe, really was Crest, which obviously makes money on transactional income by buying and selling. I mentioned that it's been helpful for us. I also mentioned competition has abated quite a bit, and we really don't have to use it, and haven't, over the last two quarters. But with Crest, we really think the risks are twofold. First, in an increasing cap rate environment, really your inventory gets marked down continually. And if you bought it thinking I'm going to sell this thing at a 100 basis point spread, when cap rates are moving up, what can happen is your 100 can become 90, then 80, then 40 and eventually go negative. So you end up losing some money rather than making it, that really brings up the second risk, which is impairment. Since the properties in this type of business are held for sale, this is a mark-to-market business. And if the cap rate you sell at goes above the cap rate you bought at you must immediately impair the property and continue to do so each quarter if cap rates continue to rise. And we think, obviously, if cap rates do rise the way we think they might, there's an enhanced risk of that today. The second risk there is what we saw this quarter, which is if you did a default or a vacancy, then you must immediately impair the property and look at its current value for sale if it is vacant, and that also can take a hit. So we really think, given that, given that we see higher caps taking Crest to inactive status until either we get a recovering economy or we get a stable cap rate environment, probably makes sense. And then still, we would probably only use it if we felt it would help us buy larger portfolios and not just to add on some incremental transaction volume and FFO. And again, thankfully, we've got the volume down substantially to only about $31 million, and we'll continue to reduce that and see if we can get it to zero either by the end of the second quarter or shortly thereafter. And that is about $0.05, as I mentioned, of the reduction in guidance. And then the next one, obviously, is looking at the credit facility. It's up in the fall. We also have a one-year option to extend, that is up to us. And so we have a fair amount of time on that line. However, really looking at the credit environment, we think it's prudent to not assume that things will be great 12 months down the road, and see if we can't extend that and work on it a bit, and that's something that we're doing. And again, we will report on that, were we to be successful with that, we think there's about $0.01 a share there, and those three make up the $0.10 per share in guidance. Now, the fourth thing we're doing, and it really relates back to seeing cap rates rising or feeling that they are going to further than they have, is to moderate our acquisition activity for a quarter or so here. This has no impact at all to guidance. We've used $250 million in our guidance, with $181 million done in the first quarter. So, obviously, we think we will hit that. I think for those of us that's followed us a few years, we would usually be increasing that guidance at this time of the year. As you'll recall, we used $250 million as our initial guidance in both '06 and '07, and ended up doing $700 million and $500 million. However, this year, we're going to step back over the next quarter and reduce our activity and watch the market. Given we think cap rates are rising and might go up a bit further, I think buying a lot in the next quarter that we may be able to buy cheaper in the fall probably doesn't make sense. And so obviously, if it's something that's a 9 cap now, if we think it could be a 9.5 later in the year then it's probably prudent to step back and do that. Obviously, if things stabilize in the cap rate environment or something really compelling comes along, we can move fairly quickly, given the liquidity. But I think it's a good time to sit back and watch a bit, and that's what we intend to do. I did mention earlier I think there are a number of sellers who will need to come to market probably in the fall and into '09 if the credit markets don't open up. So I am actually a little bit optimistic about what that could mean for cap rates and also for volumes, but really just not at this time and we would like to see cap rates move a bit. That will have no impact, by the way, to our guidance, again, since we're working off $250 million. Anyway, we think that based on that, then, going inactive in Crest, assuming a bit more vacancy, working on the line and moderating acquisition probably makes sense, given the economy. And the net effect overall, if you look at total FFO versus '07, is to go from $0.11 in Crest to $0.02. That's about a 5% reduction in FFO there on a year-over-year. It's a one time non-recurring, and wash that out of the system, have the core grow at 2% to 6%, and I think that gets you to kind of flat to slightly down FFO for the year. I think it also, though, which is really what we're trying to do leaves us really conservatively positioned, very liquid, I don't think with a lot of market risk. And if the economy picks up or cap rates stabilize, we can move fairly quickly. Part of this whole discussion around here was one that we similarly had last August, when we were doing the bond offering. And you'll recall that we had a need for a little over $200 million in capital, and when we did the bond offering took $550 million. At the time we did that, we knew, given what we saw as the acquisition pace going forward, there was probably about having that money rattling around here would probably cost us about $0.02 a share in the fourth quarter, which it did, and a $0.01 here in the first quarter, which it did, but given we felt rates would rise, probably made sense. And I think if we had not done that offering, given acquisition activity, we would probably be out in the market doing it today. And I think, conservatively, it would cost us well over 100 basis points more if we did that today, or at 100 basis points on that amount of money, that's $0.055 a share kind of annually for the next 12 years, and that's about $66 million. So we're trying to say, is there something we can do today that really positions us in what we think is a tough, challenging market credit-wise, consumer-wise, cap rate-wise, and be smart about what we're doing? And that's what I think we're trying to do. Anyway, if we do that, then for 2009 I think we've got Crest washed out of the numbers. We'll release much of the vacancy, and with only modest acquisitions are probably set up, then, for a good year, but probably flat this year. Anyway, that's what we were thinking. To summarize, then, I think the portfolio is in good shape. Obviously, acquisitions were good for a start, but we're going to slow it. Balance sheet's great, got good liquidity. Core operations continue to grow, and we see the dividend rising. And it will be an interesting year for all of us to watch what transpires. I apologize for going on a bit long, but as you know, this was an interesting release and I thought I should give some additional color this quarter. At this point, Michael, if you can come back in, we will take some questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wachovia. Please go ahead.
Jeff Donnelly: Thanks, Tom for the additional color there. A question, actually concerning the pursuit of the line, I guess I'm kind of curious, what's the motivation here, is it the extension, is it the cost of the line, are you looking to increase your capacity? I guess how are you kind of balancing those as you make your decisions?
Tom Lewis: I think really it's taking a look and saying the most important thing is continued long-term access to capital, and that's probably more important than price. So it is really recasting the line for additional term, even if it costs a bit more or we're doing it a bit early here. I just think it's a smart move in this environment. If you are wrong, it costs you a couple cents, and if you're right, then it will be one of the cheapest things you've done.
Jeff Donnelly: And then, I know you touched on some of these things in your remarks. But I'm curious, what specifically moved you to put Crest on hold, and I guess wind that down now versus, say, three to six months ago? I'm not trying, like a second guess or decision. I mean, hindsight is always 20/20. But the market's beginning to get a little more volatile and I think you were talking about rising cap rates in mid-2007, and I guess, why not the decision back then?
Tom Lewis: It's interesting, we really added inventory heavily at the end of the fourth quarter of '06 and coming into '07. Quite frankly, we had some discussions here, at that point, you could see the cost to insure residential mortgages jumped from 24 basis points to 36 to 360 basis points to 1100, and that was really the first time you saw some stress in the credit markets. And we did talk about it and went down and said, hey, look, I would like to get the majority of the inventory out under contract or have a lot of clarity by June of last year. And so we really didn't buy anything, really, in the first and second quarter, and we were moving down that way. In the third quarter, we happened along two particular transactions where we did need to use Crest. Fortunately, in both of those they were relatively good brand names, well known. The properties were in good SMSAs and the price points were $500,000 to $1.5 million. So we gulped and put the other $30 million into Crest in the third quarter, thinking they would sell quickly. Fortunately, that inventory has really moved fast. And so it was back again in the fourth quarter after that, saying let's not use it. And we really did want to reduce it, but we made a tactical decision there. Quite frankly, as we move towards the end of the year here, I wanted nothing in Crest then. And I think the other thing that you kind of think through when you've got this type of business, a lot of the things that are easy to sell the fastest. And so it kind of makes the headline look of sales and profits and everything look real good in that flip business. And a lot of what gets left in the inventory are your rougher type properties. So we also wanted to move ahead pretty aggressively with those. And I think it's all worked out for us. But quite frankly, I would've liked to be out a little earlier, Jeff.
Jeff Donnelly: And let's just say you are successful in winding down the inventory by the end of the second quarter. I'm just curious I know, Crest is not exactly a particularly large entity, at least when it comes to personnel headcount. But what happens there, I guess the gentleman and whoever else works there that is Crest Net Lease, do they sort of stay on staff and Crest runs a very small loss? How does that look, I guess in the second half of the year?
Tom Lewis: Well, since Cary is probably listening in, as you know from coming by, Crest really has only two people that work full time there, and one of them is kind of a leased employee from Realty Income. So there's only one, and that's the person who does the works selling the properties. And he has been one of our acquisition officers. He's very savvy on a real estate basis. And at the same time that that's happening, we're obviously doing more work on the portfolio and doing some sales. So his skills can be very easily used there, as well as the additional administrative support we use in the activities going on. So it's really just a couple of people and not a major allocation. Expense is fairly small, and obviously moves with the transaction volume. So it has very little impact. There is also a mortgage we took back, and I think the interest from that mortgage alone will keep Crest profitable and at very little expense. So I don't think there's a lot to be done there. Any of you that follow us, come by the office some time, and we'll walk you by there, and it will take about a second and a half to walk by Crest's offices.
Jeff Donnelly: And just one last question is, I know you kind of went through the reasons for the $0.10 a share reduction. But I guess drilling into the $0.04 specific to the core portfolio, can you tell me how much of that $0.04 was specific to; I'm trying to parse it out, how much of it was specific to Ryan's closings that have already happened, maybe closings that you might anticipate from Ryan's? And then beyond that, how much of the $0.04 is just from events that haven't transpired that you are assuming will happen?
Tom Lewis: Sure. I can tell you that of what's closed to date, all of that was in our first quarter numbers, and none of this $0.04 is that. So that is a little bit of Buffets, but we think there will be some additional, and I'd prefer not to parse it out exactly, because obviously if we are in negotiations there, that provides a lot of information. The balance, though I would say, was probably 50% stuff that really is happening real time right now in the second quarter, and the other half what we anticipate will happen the balance of the year.
Jeff Donnelly: That's helpful. Thank you.
Tom Lewis: Okay.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The next question comes from the line of Philip Martin with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Philip Martin: Good afternoon.
Tom Lewis: Hi, Philip.
Paul Meurer: Hi, Phil.
Philip Martin: A couple things here, first of all, how conservative have you gone here with this, I mean, obviously from your commentary, Tom, you've scrubbed through this pretty thoroughly, and considered a lot of factors. Do you think you have conserved enough at this point, knowing what you know?
Tom Lewis: It's interesting, I try to mention, this is what I think will happen. I haven't try to say, hey, as long as we're going to knock the number down here, let's take an extra nickel or something, so we look good later. It literally will not surprise me at all to be at the bottom end of that, and I think middle and upper can also happen there, too. Obviously, what's changed for us over the last 30 days is, I mentioned to Jeff, I had a view relative to Crest. But we kind of feel stronger about that. But it's really watching the last 90 days out in the economy. And I think you can see it is really throughout the portfolio. You look in convenience stores, which are actually pretty healthy, but you start seeing $0.02, $0.03 come off the gas margin. You start seeing a 3.5% or so or drop in sales in the stores, where a lot of the profits are made, and you can tell it's that consumer on a marginal basis. And you can look through restaurants and see prices, see a consumer still eating out, but migrating from the $18 ticket to the $16 ticket to the $12 ticket. And really, it's just really more intense. I can say that we see it a lot more here and think its happening than it was 90 days ago. So that's probably it. But we think that number that we're putting out there is what will be achieved. I wouldn't get too excited above that unless acquisitions really open up or some big deal comes along. And my sense is it would be late enough in the year where the FFO isn't really going to hit a lot this year, probably be next.
Philip Martin: Okay. And what percentage of your portfolio would fall under the 1.5 times EBITDA coverage?
Tom Lewis: Okay. I'd make it EBITDAR and include rent. But I'm not sure I can really answer that. That top 15 number, kind of the bottom guy is 1.7, and the other ones on up. I think if you get into the ones behind that, they have similar coverages, but maybe a little bit less. So there is that out there, Philip. And what we did is went through the tenants to say anybody that's close to the line relative to their leverage and see some decelerating operations, which properties have lower coverage, those would go. But even though there are some at the 1.5s, if the tenant is very strong they can probably take a fair amount of stress before anything happened. So it's out there, but there's not a huge amount of the 1.5 and below.
Philip Martin: The tenants where you -- in the anticipated or expected vacancies, where were their coverages? Kind of all over? I know coverage and tenant-specific, they don't necessarily go hand in hand.
Paul Meurer: Philip, this is Paul. Between one and two, so meaning profitable.
Philip Martin: Okay.
Paul Meurer: Certainly profitable, making money. But balance sheet, operational issues, and as we've said before, even with something, say, 1.25, once they get into -- let's say they go into a bankruptcy situation. They may still walk from a property of that nature that's even slightly profitable as part of their overall strategy. They may pull out of certain states to make their G&A more simplistic or their strategy better. So if we look at all those kinds of factors, too, with each of those tenants and said even if it's profitable, they may pull out of it, that means downtime, that means property expenses, but it also means actually we can release the things. And so it's more of an '08-type impact.
Philip Martin: In terms of just replacement value, I mean at least it's nice to think that if you have to go through one of these situations, a weaker economy, where there's stress on tenants, that you're pretty well protected from an asset value standpoint. When you look across your portfolio and you compare where you own that, on a gross basis, versus replacement value, can you give us some indication of where you stand relative to replacement value?
Tom Lewis: I think we're below replacement costs. Obviously replacement costs have moved up. I think replacement costs are going to come down a bit here. But I would think we are below, but I'd also caution one of the real new [answers] of net lease is if you get away above replacement costs, obviously whatever risk you have as much larger staying below replacement costs really helps you. But when you get into a situation where you do have some vacancy, you can assume the once you get back the ones that were stressed and if they were not great performers for somebody else, they are not going to be a great performer for the next guy. And so it's going to be doubtful that you're going to get ramp and equates back to replacement costs. So when you get into these situations, I'm not sure replacement cost is a focus number. But when you are acquiring, it's just one of those good anchor of value price points you try and throw there to make sure you're not getting too far away from reality.
Philip Martin: Okay. Exactly. It's a backstop.
Tom Lewis: Right.
Philip Martin: My last question, and you touched on it in your commentary, but in terms of -- now, I know there are several reasons for delaying some growth here, and I think the main one is to just be patient and let things ride out and to potentially wait for better pricing, better transactions, et cetera. But how much of this is really that you don't want to increase Crest's exposure? And I know you mentioned that the deals that are out there, you are possibly able to cherry-pick a little bit more. But how much of delaying some of your growth here is really related to not wanting to put really anything in Crest and have that exposure?
Tom Lewis: None whatsoever. In the last two quarters, I can tell you that there really haven't been transactions we've passed on because we didn't want to use Crest.
Philip Martin: Okay
Tom Lewis: In each case, we have been able to talk to the people and rework the portfolio and get some out and buy. So I don't think there's any at all. What it is? It is, I mentioned cap rates moving, and that's one reason. And then the second reason is, it's kind of funny -- one week we're all in a huge credit crisis, and the next week everybody feels so much better. But I'd just as soon leave the balance sheet where it is right now, with no balance on the credit line and some cash sitting around and knowing I've got free cash flow coming in. In the long-term view, which is how we try and manage the business, a quarter doesn't matter all that much. But if you get into a real tough credit environment, I think not only will you be so happy you do that, it's far worth the quarter you kind of laid back a bit. And then secondarily, it will leave you in position; then if there's some stratification between those that have balance sheets and those that don't, you might have some opportunities. So it's really just a call for that, and we'll clearly say we might be wrong with it, but that's what we're going to do.
Philip Martin: No, it sounds like a good plan, at least in my opinion. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Please go ahead.
Ambika Goel: This is Ambika with Michael.
Tom Lewis: Hi, Ambika.
Ambika Goel: Hi. Could you go through the anticipated releasing cost of releasing this vacant space and what kind of timeframe you're assuming -- I think you said six to nine months -- and how should we think about historically what it's been and what you are anticipating in the future?
Tom Lewis: I would use nine months. I wouldn't use six. Now, some will be done in three and then some will take much longer. But I would lay it right on that. Relative to increased expenses this year, Paul, in our guidance?
Paul Meurer: Yes, it's really the taxes, maintenance, insurance, the additional let's call that carrying costs that you eat during that timeframe before you release the property. It's a little bit of a double hit, right? You have no rent for a bit. Then you recover close to all of it or some of it, or most of it, in most cases. But in the meantime, you're also paying the property expenses. So this year, we estimate property expenses at around $5.5 million. You're seeing that already start to present itself in the first quarter. Property expense number, for the most part, is going to be a little bit larger than that run rate if you multiply that by four. That compares to about $3.5 million in 2007. So that's about $0.02 a share, and that's part of the $0.04 that we're looking at. So when we talk about a little bit of a loss from vacancy issues in the portfolio, it's not just about downtime with rent. Some of it is related to the property expenses.
Ambika Goel: Okay. Great. And then if we're thinking about AFFO, how should we think about the CapEx associated with refitting the space for a new tenant?
Paul Meurer: You know, we really don't foresee a lot more of CapEx on that. That's a very good question. For everyone's benefit out there, CapEx for us has typically been a very minimal issue. In 2007, it was about $1.8 million, 2006 less than $1 million, 2005 $1.5 million, 2004 $1 million, et cetera. So, it's kind of been in that $1 million, $1.5 million range. We have estimated already CapEx a little bit larger than that. But that was for some strategic ideas we had for putting some more money in properties to release them. As it relates to these specific new vacancies, as it relates to, say, bankruptcies and that sort of thing, a few more dollars, but that's not a big issue for us. In addition, we have small straight-line rent. It's never been a big part of our rental income stream. Our AFFO, on a quarterly basis, has typically been $0.01 or higher than our FFO. And we absolutely expect that to be the case. It was in the first quarter, and we expect that to be the case as the year progresses. So I think AFFO this year could be as much as $0.04 or higher, and actually as much as $0.06, perhaps, if you choose to add impairments back when you compute AFFO. And I know a lot of analysts do that differently.
Ambika Goel: Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess what gets you comfortable with the fact that the CapEx will be low? Are you far along in your discussions for re-tenanting these assets?
Paul Meurer: Well, I think, and I will let Tom augment this. But I think, to give the example for Ryan's, we obviously not too long ago did inspections on those properties, a year and a half to two years ago, if you will. And we found them to be not only in good locations, but in excellent shape -- in some cases, excellent shape from a physical standpoint, and that really hasn't been the issue relative to operations or what have you. So we don't see a lot of dollars. When we actually do an acquisition up front, we certainly look for deferred maintenance items, negotiate those issues up front, either have those repairs made or make sure there's dollars set aside for that. And that purchase, to use that example, was so recent that it's not like there's a whole bunch of maintenance or CapEx issues that we have identified right away.
Tom Lewis: Yeah, Ambika. This is Tom. As you go through the -- when we scrubbed it and we did our list of vacancies, either there has been with one tenant a major renovation effort not long before they started running into problems. And the other ones, the assets are relatively new. So, unlike lease rollover, where you might expect it at the end of 20 years, these assets were in very good shape. So that's not a big component of it.
Ambika Goel: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Chris Lucas: Good afternoon, guys.
Tom Lewis: Hi, Chris.
Paul Meurer: Hi, Chris.
Chris Lucas: Just one quick question, what is the pace of acquisition for the first quarter, was it early, mid, late quarter? How would I think about that?
Tom Lewis: I think we thought it would be early, and then it became mid, and then it became late, just like all quarters. It seems like all of these things end up closing towards the end of the quarter every quarter.
Chris Lucas: Okay. So I should think about it more as a quarter-end kind of event?
Tom Lewis: That's kind of how we look at it. And it's just funny, because as you get into doing a deal, everybody kind of sits around. Even if they are private and it's a seller, they still report quarterly numbers to somebody, and somehow getting it done by the end of the quarter is what happens.
Paul Meurer: It's funny, Chris. As you look at the yields that a lot of those deals were done at, the 8.7, you should think of that as early-quarter metric, because this was kind of a yield agreement that we came to with the tenant late last year. But the transaction itself, as Tom said, as is typical for whatever reason, tends to be loaded towards the end of the quarter, and that's where the volume came in, in terms of where you'd plug it into your model. But in terms of where you think cap rates kind of are, think of that 8.7 as more of a January cap rate, not a March cap rate, if that makes any sense.
Chris Lucas: Yes. I guess just a quick follow-up. You mentioned the AFFO adjustments. When is the Q going to be out, Paul?
Paul Meurer: It will be out this afternoon.
Chris Lucas: Super. And then my last question -- are you guys seeing any development opportunities come back to you because of poor local sponsorship and the inability to sort of finance the developments through the pipeline or through the completion?
Tom Lewis: You know, we are hearing of some. I've got a phone call to return right after this on an opportunity. But to be perfectly frank, we do not want to do much in the way of development opportunities. We've cut that down quite a bit over time. And I think it's really a function of finding, over and over and over again, absent a couple of tenants that are extraordinarily strong, that when you're doing development we don't know what the EBITDAR is on that unit until it stabilizes two years later. And that way, we can end up with some of the ones that don't work out. We'd just as soon buy them existing where we can see that stabilized cash flow coverage up front.
Chris Lucas: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of [Michael O'Royne] with Sun Capital Advisors.
Michael O'Royne: Actually, my question has been answered. Thank you.
Tom Lewis: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Stephanie Krewson with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.
Stephanie Krewson: Hi, guys. Somewhat related to Ambika's questions earlier, just looking at the Buffets restaurants, being a Delaware native I may be one of the only sell-side analysts that's actually ever been in one. But they're kind of specific boxes. How fungible do you anticipate those boxes being, or I mean, could you just give some further detail on your thoughts as to who would re-tenant that space?
Tom Lewis: Yeah. It's going to be a restaurant. And I think one of the issues there that we've come back with, and I think maybe it's one of those in the underwriting that I don't know that we missed -- I know that it came up in discussion, but I probably focused more on this time -- those are 10,000 square foot units. They are very big lots. That's great. However, a lot of the users are in the 6000 to 8000 square foot range. So you're probably going to get some of the people where your rent is a bit lower. With that said, a lot of them, close to half, were either Lowe's or Wal-Mart type outpads. So I think there's…
Stephanie Krewson: Exactly.
Tom Lewis: …a variety of people that would want to do them. But I think you may see some local restaurants. I think you may see some smaller chains. In some cases, we may end up with somebody that has one restaurant, wants to open a second, and sees this as an opportunity. And we may not want it in the portfolio but we would encourage that guy to get an SBA loan or something along those lines and try and sell it to him. And a lot of those guys are owner-users. So I think it's just generic restaurants, and it's generally going to be the 6000 to 8000 square foot type user.
Stephanie Krewson: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And we've have a follow-up question from the line of Philip Martin. Please go ahead.
Philip Martin: Yes. One last quick question. Would you envision any scenario where you may sell some of the Buffets where the leases have been affirmed, et cetera?
Tom Lewis: I think that's one of the things you can always consider. But that's obviously a post-reorganization. One thing, and this is not specific to Buffets when you go through this. It's not a lot of fun and you don't want it. However, coming out the other side, generally the balance sheet is significantly in better shape than it was before, and you have that opportunity.
Philip Martin: Okay. So from the location standpoint, you're pretty comfortable with these locations and the re-leasing and re-tenanting, if it comes to that, with more of the properties?
Tom Lewis: Yes. With the ones that are affirmed and coming out the other side, I'm very comfortable they can be sold, in terms of the re-leasing and re-tenanting. And it's just not a lot of fun, but it's something we do for a living.
Philip Martin: Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn it back over to management for closing remarks.
Tom Lewis: Great. Listen, I apologize for the length of the call late in the day. I really appreciate the time and appreciate the attention on what was an interesting quarter. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for using AT&T Teleconferencing.

Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Realty Income, fourth quarter 2007 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Lewis, CEO of Realty Income. Go ahead sir.
Tom Lewis: Thank you very much, Benz and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to our conference call and our purpose is, again, to go over the operations and the results of our 2007 fourth quarter and year and then we see if can offer some color for 2008, as is our custom. In the room with me today is Gary Malino our President and Chief Operating Officer; Paul Meurer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Pfeiffer, our Executive Vice President General Counsel, and Tere Miller, our Vice President of Corporate Communications. And as always, I’ll start by saying that during this conference call we will make certain statements that may be considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in these forward-looking statements and we will disclose in greater details in the company's quarterly report and on the Form 10-K the factors that may cause such differences. And Paul Meurer, then if you could go ahead and start with an overview of the numbers in the quarter and the year, well get kicked off.
Paul Meurer: Thank you, Tom. As usual, I am going to comment on our financial statements, provide some highlights of our financial results for the fourth quarter and start by walking through the income statement. Total revenue increased 16.8% for the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Rental revenue increased to just under $78 million in the quarter, primarily as a result of new property acquisitions. On an annualized basis, our current total rental revenues are now approximately $318 million. Same-store rental revenue increased 1.2% for the quarterly period and 1.4% for the year. Other income was unusually high at almost $2.7 million for the quarter, due to the interest income from excess cash proceeds invested from our September bond offering. On the expense side, depreciation and amortization expense increased by almost $4.6 million in the comparative quarterly period, and depreciation expenses increased as our portfolio continues to grow. Interest expense increased by about $9 million during the fourth quarter, as compared to the fourth quarter of last year and that's increased due to more bonds outstanding, as compared to a year ago, specifically to $550 million of 2,019 notes we issued in September. We had zero borrowings on our facility throughout the fourth quarter. On a related note, our interest coverage ratio continues to be very strong at 4.1 times, while our fixed charge coverage ratio also remains strong at 3.1 times. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter were about $5.5 million, representing only 6.8% of total revenues for the quarter. Overall for the year, G&A expenses were $22.7 million, or about 7.7% of total revenues. We expect G&A expenses in 2008 to remain at or maybe even below this ratio. Property expenses went down on a comparative basis to $872,000 for the quarter. Overall, our portfolio remains very healthy at 97.9 % occupancy. Total property expenses for the year were only about $3.5 million and we expect these expenses to essentially remain flat or slightly higher in 2008. Income taxes, which consist of income taxes paid to various states by the company, these taxes totaled $444,000 for the quarterly period. Income from discontinued operations for the quarter was $3,115,000. Real estate acquired for resale of first few operations of Crest Net Lease, our subsidiary that acquires and resells properties. Crest sold 17 properties for $25.7 million during the fourth quarter, for a gain on sale of $3.5 million and overall for the quarter, Crest contributed net income or FFO of $2,735,000. Real estate house for investment refers to property sales by Realty Income from our existing core portfolio. We sold four properties during the fourth quarter, resulting overall in net income of $380,000. Preferred stock cash dividend increased to about $6.1 million for the quarter, because of the Class D preferred shares we issued in the fall of 2006. Net income available to common stock holders was $27,113,000, down slightly from $28.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. For the year, net income increased by over $15.7 million to about $116 million. Funds from operations or FFO increased 6.5% in the quarterly period. FFO per share increased 4.3% to $0.48 per share, as compared to $0.46 per share in the fourth quarter of 2006. $0.03 of this quarter's FFO came from positive results from our Crest sales activity. Our FFO per share before the Crest contribution or FFO generated by our core portfolio was $0.45 per share as compared to $0.46 per share in the fourth quarter of '06. As we noted in the press release, the primary reason for this number being slightly less, is the holding cost associated with the excess cash we raised in the September bond offering.  Funds from operations for the year increased 21.8%. FFO per share, for the year increased 9.2% to $1.89 per share as compared to a $1.73 the year before. FFO before Crest for the year increased 3.5% to a $1.78 per share, as compared to a $1.72 per share in 2006. When we file our 10-K, we'll then provide information you need to compute our adjusted funds from operations or AFFO or actual cash available for distribution as divided. Our AFFO, or cash available for distribution is typically higher than our FFO, as our capital expenditures are relatively low and we don’t have a lot of straight line ramp. Our continued growth in earnings allowed us to continue to increase in our monthly dividend this quarter. In December, we increased the dividend for the 41st consecutive quarter and the 47th increase of the dividend overall since we went public over 13 year ago. Monthly dividend paid for the year increased 8.6%, as compared to last year. Our current monthly dividend is now $13.675 per share, which equates to a current annualized amount of $1.641 per share. Our dividend payout ratio for 2007 was only 82.5% of our funds from operations and even lower on an AFFO basis. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain our conservative capital structure. Our debt total market capitalization is only 32% and our preferred stock outstanding represented only 8% of our capital structure. We have zero borrowings on our $300 million credit facility and thus, we have no exposure to variable rate debt. Our credit facility also has a $100 million expansion of (inaudible). Furthermore, as of year end we had a $193 million of cash remaining from the September bond offering. This cash is also available for 2008 acquisition, before we even need to borrow on the credit facility. In November 2008, we have a 100 million of bonds coming to you and in January 2009, we have another $20 million of bonds coming due. We've planed to reserve cash or credit facility capacity for this $120 million of obligations over the next 12 months. Thereafter, our next debt maturity isn't until 2013, so we do not need to access any new capital for any upcoming financing needs, which I am very happy about, and so I'm not sure the public capital markets are really very open and available right now anyway. In summary, we currently have tremendous liquidity with substantial available capital for acquisitions and our overall balance sheet remains very healthy and very safe. Now, let me turn the call back over to Tom, who will give you more background on these results.
Tom Lewis: Okay. Thank you, Paul. What I'm going to do is normally run through the key operating areas of the company and then I'll try and give you some color relative to the rest of 2008. Let me start with the portfolio. The portfolio is generally performing well. We ended the fourth quarter with 97.9% occupancy, which means we had only 48 properties available for lease out of the 2270 that we have on the portfolio. That's down about 40 basis points from the previous quarter, and is primarily a function of lease rollovers varying month-to-month. And that we think continues to reflect pretty good operations in the company at the 97.9% occupancy. The vacancy continues to come primarily from the normal activity of dealing with lease rollovers. And that's basically coming to the end of the 15-year to 20-year lease, which we have all the time, given the size of the portfolio, and how long the company has been around, and I think that the portfolio management department does a pretty good job of handling most of those without them coming to vacancy with some due. Eight of the new vacancies, however, did come from credit default from a couple of tenants this quarter. It's not a larger number, given almost 2,300 properties, however, it has not been the case as most of you know, over the last 6, 7, 8 quarters that any of that was coming from credit default and so it peaked my interest. I took some time to go in and take a look at each of the situations and try and get an idea what it was. And after looking at it, I really don't think it is tenant-oriented or really related to a couple of the tenants we have on just a few properties. By the way our projection of rent loss on the release of the 8th we estimated about $10,000 in annual ramp dissolve, so it is not significant given that we have about $300 million in annual revenue. I think almost everybody is aware of the Buffets filing involving 116 properties that we own in our portfolio. They comprised about 7.7% of our rents and that reorganization is ongoing; we think it will take a couple or three quarters to work itself out. I would say we feel pretty good about our situation on those assets. We believe the properties we own with Buffets are the more profitable properties and as such we should do pretty well on the reorganization. We also believe we bought those assets at very attractive prices and also very attractive rents and that is we should do pretty well. I would note though, it is an evolving situation and as is typical with these; we have worked on many of them, generally it takes a while for them to work themselves out and since it is in the course, I am going to be mindful in my comments today that I don't want to get too specific relative to the individual assets or the components or outcome of process and that's probably a good general idea of disclosure. However, we will report fully a postmortem on this as we get through it and talk about what went on as we typically do when these situations come up. And it will be very instructive for all of us a couple of quarters down the road, to walk through this and take a look at it and I think we will all find it interesting. We will have some brief commentary in the K that we will disclose, as I said we have 116 properties that represent about 7.7% of ramp. Buffets has rejected 24 properties on a Schedule (b) filing right after the bankruptcy and none of them, none were Realty income properties. I will also say that as of February 12th Buffets was current with the lease payment on all of our properties; that does mean the February ramp and some here in the middle of February that means they are paid up on all of the properties. And we will also say that based on our current analysis of the Buffets locations that are actually owned by Realty Income, we believe that the filing will not have a material effect on our operations or the financial position of the company and that commentary will be indicative and we'll it file shortly. I would also add for everybody’s benefit that the Buffets filing was not part of our assumptions as we put guidance out for 2008 on the November call as you may have noticed, we have the same guidance for 2008 now as we did on the November call however, we do have the Buffets filing and our current opinion of its resolution is included in those assumptions that we use for guidance today and obviously we have the same numbers in guidance for 2008. Let we move on. Same-store rents in the portfolio increased 1.2% during the first quarter, our fourth quarter that’s why it was 1.1% for the same period a year-ago and for the year we're up about 1.4%. Of the 30 industries that we have represented in the portfolio only one had declining same-store rent during the quarter and that probably won't surprise you that that was home improvement, five had flat same-store rents and 24 of the industries have same-store rent increases and about half of the increases came from sporting goods, childcare, restaurant portfolio and convenient stores. We continue with our acquisitions to further diversify the portfolio as I mentioned earlier, we're up to 2,270 properties. We have 30 retail industries represented in the portfolio and as of today, about a 115 different retail chains. We are not in 49 states; we added one state last year, which was Maine. We are still not in Hawaii, perhaps due diligence at the senior level might be warranted on that guys. For the year, we added 325 new properties to the portfolio, they released the 16 retailers and 12 of the retailers were new to our portfolio. I think we remain fairly well-diversified relative to industry exposure. As you may have noticed in the release, restaurants were up, given the recent transactions that we've done in the industry over the last couple of years. At the end of the fourth quarter, we were about 24.2% as we went out and took advantage of really some of the dislocation that's going on in the restaurant industry and there are particular needs for financing recently. We now believe, given we're at that level, we are full in the restaurant sector. We stepped back actually, very little of what we did in the fourth quarter was restaurant and now you'll see we’ve reduced that back under 20% of the portfolio, which will primarily be through acquisitions in other areas. We've done that before with other industries and now we'll do it with restaurants, which is an industry that we like. The second largest industry is convenience stores, which is about 14.1% exactly where we were a year ago with it and down from 19% two or three or four years ago. After that we have theaters, at about 8.4%, which is down from 10% a couple of years ago, and then child care, which is about 7.7%; for those of you who've covered us for many years that was actually close to 50% of the portfolio a numbers of years ago. So we continue to be diversified. I think, as a goal, generally we want to keep any one industry under 20% and any tenant under 10%. We will, from time to time, go a little bit beyond that, if there are some compelling opportunities in an industry. But we don’t get much beyond that, we want to stop and then take it back under 20% and that's obviously what we will be doing here and we have done a couple of times in the past. From a tenant stand point, our largest tenant is about 7.7% of rent here. Currently, I think it was 7.8% on 1231. The next largest tenant in the portfolio is about 4.5% and then our ten top tenants are a group, or about 42% of revenue. Our top 15 are largest 15 tenants are about 55% and once you get beyond the 15 you're really down about 2% of rent and so I think we remained fairly well diversified relative to the tenant base. (inaudible) remaining lease link when the portfolio also continued to increase and is pretty healthy at 13 years and that’s really been going up as a function of a fairly high level of acquisition activity that has been coupled with when we are writing lease rollovers, where obviously the leases have become very short and we lengthen those out when we realized them. So I think in some of the portfolios, we have seen a little bit of credit deposit this quarter, but with occupancy very strong and same store rent up, we feel very good about where we sit today and also where we are going to be throughout the course of the year. Let me move on to property acquisitions, which were obviously very active in the fourth quarter, where we bought $120.8 million in new property, we had 93 new properties and properties under development. Average cap rate that was very attractive at about 8.6% and at an average lease term of about 19.5 years. So, very good additions from a standpoint of the spread that we will be receiving, as well as the length of the leases. There were about nine different retailers in four industries and spread out in 19 states. All of that was for the core portfolio and none of the acquisitions were for our Crest Net Lease subsidiary in the fourth quarter. We funded that $120 million of acquisitions, with cash on hand that was generated from our September issuance when we issued $550 million of 12 year notes at a 6.77% rate. So with an 86 cap in the money costing us 677 we have about a 183 basis points positive spread on those acquisitions that should increase as lease payments accelerate and time goes on. For the year then, I gave $533 million in acquisitions on 357 properties, that obviously was significantly above our estimate for the year, of the $503 million and 325 properties were for our core portfolio and only about a $30 million was for our Crest Net lease subsidiary. And again, the average cap rate was about $8.6% and it was well diversified by tenant and also by industry and by the states that it was located in. By the way, $533 million is our second largest year in acquisitions which really does follow behind '06 where we did about $777 million and obviously all of those acquisitions should positively impact our FFO for 2008. Normally on this call and I'll do it again this year, we give you some statistics relative to what we went through in committee and the percentage of the transactions that we reviewed that we actually looked at. We have a lot of transactions come in the door that generally our acquisition officers will take a look at and realize pretty quickly they don’t fit what we're looking for. So I am not including those in these numbers, but if you want to take this down, I will give you an idea of the activity that we had in committee and what we bought. In committee this year, we worked on 112 separate transactions, they involved 2342 properties, the approximate value of the real estate was 3.95 billion the average cost of our property was about $1.68 million and the average cap rate was just down 8.6%. And out of those, during the year, we acquired and closed on 20 of the 112 transactions, about 357 properties, as I mentioned earlier for 533 million, the average cost for property that we acquired was about $1.5 million, the average cap rate 8.6%, and so I think that works out to about 13.5% of what we worked on. So it clearly was a very, very active year. In 2007, again about [$4 billion, about $533 million], about 13.5% that compares to in '06 working on about $5.2 billion, acquiring $770 million, or about 14.8% in '05 going through about $3.5 billion and buying 14% of that in '04, about $2.6 billion and buying $215 million or about 8% of that. I think the highest percentage here we've had was '03 where we went through about 1.4 billion and bought $372 million. But as you can see, while the overall volume we worked on was down a little bit in '06. the volume historically was still pretty high, and the percentage was pretty much right inline with the 14 then have to 15% generally what we are looking at we've been buying over the last six years or so. We've tried to remain selective and really watch credit and put those things in the portfolio we bought, the lead we will get will be paid on. Relative to the acquisition environment, generally and kind of how we see things at the balance for 2008, it is most certainly an interesting acquisition environment out there today. And in cap rates in the fourth quarter that closed and those that we contracted for in the fourth quarter, but were closed on the first quarter of 2008, will remain pretty flat. I think the 86 number is pretty good for planning purposes. And obviously, we still have a lot of capital from the bond issuance or cash to fund those the cost of 6.77%, so we should be able to maintain good spreads. I would say that on current negotiations, the world has really changed and in just the last few weeks, relative to how the markets look, I think capital has really dried up in the debt markets for lot of the people that are out there acquiring properties today are trying to sell it. I think a lot of the net lease buyers that would have been working on larger transactions over the last couple of years have exited the marketplace and so competition out there has really come down, relative to those people that are out in the marketplace and looking for transactions. I think there are some people out there looking to sell properties and do some transactions in the next few months and they are really seeing that the process is working differently. And there are much fewer buyers out there for them. And I think there are bunch of people out there who thought they had a transaction pending and we are running a process that some of the transactions have really flown away from them as they get close to closing and it has really had an impact on the market. My best guess, looking at deal talk out in the marketplace on larger institutional transactions, I think there has been some movement in cap rates, maybe in the 35, 60, 70 basis points in the price stock just over the last month or so which is pretty substantial as the institutional transactions lagged the one off market. I think for developments, properties for future delivery, quotes were getting much harder to come by for the people who have projects some of which they have committed to that really come out for delivery 6 to 12 or 18 months down the way and if they are going to build them, they are going to have to do so in a moving cap rate environment. And then I think probably the one we noticed the most is in the one off market kind of the 1031; one property being sold at a time and anecdotally kind of a high 6 to 7 '07 cap rates on individual properties that we saw out there in the 1031 market over the last couple of years or so have really moved. And the things that we see coming in the door today where people are selling one-off properties have moved into the high 7s and the 8s. So there maybe as much as 50 to 100 basis points movement on cap rate in those one-off transactions in the 1031 market. And I really think that is also based on the fact that it’s a decent quality retailer and the price point is attractive out in the market today. If it is in a secondary market or say a tertiary market or let’s say kind of third rate retailer or if there is anything where it looks a little funny, then I think cap rates may even move more. Much of it came through I think credit spreads, gapping out in the bond market today. Now, obviously that’s a kind of a current look as to what we've seen in the last three four weeks and most of you know that there has been very little capital market activity out in the CMBS market or in financing a real estate and it obviously can move back, but if financing stays the way it is, I’ll tell you it wouldn’t surprise me to see cap rates out in the second quarter and in the third quarter, maybe up about 9% in the above range on transactions. So I think it will be really interesting to see how this transpires and again I am talking about pretty good product in decent areas at good price points, but it is very much in transition today, in real time. We were thinking about this and going back and looking at cap rates from a historical perspective and I was trying to take a look at the cap rates we bought out and then look at high yield data in the marketplace and where it was priced on a yield basis. And it’s interesting that from about 1969 and 1993, we bought pretty much in a 10.5 to 12 cap rate range and during that period of time, you're really looking at the high yield index with a low yield of about and nine and three quarters, 10ish and then during some dark periods getting very high. 94 to 96 you started seeing cap rates come in to 10.5 and 11, high yield was priced at 9.5 to 11. 97 to 99 cap rates came down and for few years there were pretty solid and almost everything seemed to get priced at around 10.5 and the high yield index was running 9 to 11. In 2000 to 2002, high yield bumped up in the 12% to 14% range. I think that had an impact on caps and we were back to 10.5 and 11, but it was really just in recent years in '03 and '04 when cap rates fell down into the 9, 9.5 range, high yields dropped from about 13 to 8.5, and in the last three years, a lot of us have got used to watching in this market 8.5 caps when we had the high yields in the 7% to 8% range. And I really think what's driving this is the changing general financing market and also high yield. High yield today, you're looking at 10 plus in the yield range, and I really think in the second half of the year or maybe out in the second quarter, you'll see cap rates in these types of products moving up to about 9%, and I think it will be very interesting to see. In terms of us, for 2008, we've used a $250 million in acquisitions in our guidance. We think we will do a lot of that in the first half of the year and have a pretty good first quarter and most of that are pretty good spreads using the cash up that we have sitting on the balance sheet from our bond offering. And that should give us a very comfortable start to the year. And then it’s really kind of a guess beyond that. I'm not sure I would put out much capital than yesterday. I think we're seeing price stocks up in the 9 and my sense is that you will see those things that were contracted for in the fourth quarter, that are delivered in the first quarter, we acquired probably being in the high 86, but then I think in the second quarter you might see it move beyond that. And it's our observation that any time you are seeing cap rates move like this, it's probably a good time even though we have cash allocate and we have obviously a lot of room on the credit facility and kind of watch things for or month or so and only act very selectively, we didn’t get high rates and I think moving out beyond using the cash, I really watched cap rates and saw where you can match fund and so I think it is a good time to make sure that you are not catching the falling knife and you are taking advantage of some moving cap rates. And so I think it could be at worst case an okay year, right in guidance with acquisitions, because we are going to be off to a good start or it could get very interesting if other forms of capital are not available and there are people out there that are looking to do some things. And obviously, with the cash on the balance sheet and the credit facility there is a lot of room for us to do that if we wanted to do it. Another way to say it is I think we pre-funded the acquisitions for the first quarter and some of the second quarter by the $193 million sitting on the balance sheet and beyond that will be interesting to see, but I think we will have a good year. Let me move on to Crest Net Lease for a moment, most of you that follows know that Crest is our subsidiary that buys and then sells properties that we started 8 years ago. It has been a very good performer for us and helping us buy large portfolios and then sell off some positions, so we can keep our diversification. However, we all say it is a very different business. Our core revenue is very, very predictable of long-term leases and Crest really comes from some carry on spread on inventory, but mostly from property sales and its pretty volatile. We did, from a historical standpoint for everybody, we started Crest and in 2002 did $0.04 a share, in '03 $0.06 up to $0.10 in '04, $0.03 in '05, $0.02 in '06 and then in '07 here had about $0.11 a share in Crest. So it is fairly volatile and based on sales. And that $0.11 was really a function of a higher starting inventory during the first quarter of 2007 and then a high level of sales throughout the year. We started 2007 with 60 properties in inventory in Crest that had a value of about a $138 million and we added most of it in the fourth quarter of 2006. We sold, during the year, 62 properties for a $123 million, had gains on sales of about $12 million and made the $0.11 of share. During 2007, we bought only about 32 properties for $30 million in Crest. So we really, over the course of the year, paired inventory pretty dramatically from where we started last year with a $138 million At year end here, we have had only about $56 million of inventory and that’s 30 properties and that’s less than we had in '06. And we anticipate cutting that pretty dramatically here in the first quarter where we have a fairly active level of sales and we also anticipate no acquisitions in Crest in the first quarter. And I’ll tell you that the activity has been excellent in Crest, I think that we have either properties closed under contract or with LOIs out of the 30, all the 7 of the properties that are in our inventory to-date. So I think at the end of the first quarter you will see the inventory in Crest was down pretty dramatically and through the second quarter (inaudible) to not much in Crest at all. Spreads have been very good though on sales we averaged in '07 about 113 basis points on our property sales and we still have a pretty good spreads. I think last year we were anticipating closer to 50 to 75 basis points. So it’s a pretty spread year wise on those sales. Again guidance for this year we've put in guidance only between $0.02 to $0.07 a share in Crest, versus the $0.11 last year. We think a good part of that will be made in the first half of the year and on much lower inventory levels after that which I very much like having a little bit or no inventory here in what seems to be uncertain market. With cap rates moving up, I think that this type of business will carry more risk than it has in the last few years and we really intend to minimize the use of Crest in 2008. If cap rates rise obviously in that business, you can loose your spread or go negative on it, and I'm very vary of adding large inventory there, so happy to have it down and we'll continue to get it that way, but very pleased we have lot for sale there. Let me move on to the capital market side of the business. Paul mentioned we have no balance on the $300 billion credit line, 193 million in cash. We also have the Crest sales that will be bring capital back into the company and also have probably around $37 million we're estimating in free cash flow for the year. So I think that we're well capitalized and given where we see acquisition levels right now, I don't really think that we'll be out in the capital market going on in the near future. I think it's interesting because I think cash is becoming more valuable, over the last few years cash has been kind of a commodity and real estate was very valuable. So I think you're seeing a bit of a reversal here and having on hand is becoming valuable and there are lot of properties moving out at commodity level today. Relative to dividends, as Paul mentioned we've increased the dividends over the last 41 quarters in a row. We continue to be comported keeping the payout ratio about where it is, and given that with FFO growing this year absent anything on foreseeing we think we'll be able to grow the dividend again here in 2008. Paul covered FFO and so I won't go too much into that. It was a very good in FFO for the company overall. Core FFO grew at a decent clip although it moderated in the third and fourth quarter, again as Paul mentioned because we kept a fairly large amount of cash on hand which caused us few cents in the short-term. We also have some moving cost into our new building here, but I think taking that capital on the balance sheet, getting it out over the next year good spread we will get the benefit of that for the next 12 years or so and I think it will help us relative to FFO. Let me talk a bit a minute for about our guidance, it is unchanged this quarter. We are looking at $1.94 to $2.0 a share, which we think is reasonable at this time of the year. That would equate to somewhere around 3% to 6% FFO growth, on what we think a fairly moderate assumptions relative to acquisitions and capital. And again, we look for Crest to decline in that from $0.11 down to 227, and that means we anticipate a very good growth in the core portfolio this year. Our guess is somewhere around 6% plus. Anyway, that’s our best estimate and kind a review of operations of now, I will just say in summarizing, the portfolio is in good shape, acquisitions had a good year. It was a great year for FFO growth. The balance sheet, which I think at this stage in the marketplace is probably the most important issue for any company, is in great shape and we do not have a lot we are obliged to do in that and we are happy to have the cash on hand. So that will wrap up our comments and if we can have the operator come back, we would be happy to entertain any questions that people have.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first call comes from Dustin Pizzo with Banc of America Securities. Go ahead please.
Sumit Preet - Banc of America Securities: Hi, this is actually [Sumit Preet] for Dustin Pizzo.
Tom Lewis: Yeah. How are you Sumit?
Sumit Preet - Banc of America Securities: Pretty good. I wanted to know what the… I have questions on coverage ratios. You can tell me what the coverage ratio is on Buffets portfolio, and also maybe the coverage on your top ten tenants?
Tom Lewis: Yeah. I won't comment specifically on the coverage ratios due to confidentiality agreement with FAS, but I can give you some good background that I think will get you where you need to go. As of 12/31, our largest then out of 15 tenants did about 55% of our revenue as I mentioned earlier The average cash-flow coverage in the portfolio was about 2.72 times. And if you didn’t look at the overall, then out of that at 2.72 I think the lowest coverage that we had out of the top 15 was a 19 coverage. The highest was the 419, and again a 2.72 average. I will tell you that 19 was not a restaurant company, it was in another industry, So it felt -- the coverages on our portfolio felt somewhere within that grouping, which is very strong. We've been working since right after the end of the year here updating that, and we have seen the coverages move a little bit overall in the portfolio. But still for the top 15, just getting in some numbers last week on a couple of the tenants, and we do these updating and rolling throughout the year because we get the information at different times. I think the average, when we calculated the last week, was 264, and I think the spread was 170 to about 420, and I would say again the 170, which was lowest then. It was not a restaurant company. So that will give you an idea of where we sit on coverages. For those of you that aren’t familiar with that, that is looking at the EBITDA of the stores that we own in our portfolio and the ramp about basically get how many times coverage that's a possibility that store is of rent. And to give an idea that 20 coverage, you need about a 50% decline in EBITDA to get a one-to-one coverage. And if you look at two six times coverage -- that means on average there is about a 61.5% decline in EBITDA would take on the properties in our portfolio to get to a break-even.
Sumit Preet - Banc of America Securities: All right. And also do you have any retailers that are maybe in your watch list with bankruptcy risk?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, we've got a few I think the ones that we have out there fairly well known, but (inaudible) on it obviously. We also have Hollywood Video on it, which I think is movie gallery, and then there is just after that a couple of small tenants. I think there is a restaurant that had three units, rejected one, if a deal where it was a $2 million land and building, and we only bought the land under it so we get the building for free so that one we anticipate we'll get better than 100% or run out of it. And then the ones I mentioned earlier was a small convenience change were got our property back and then the movie gallery, and so there is really not a huge amount on there right now, and outside of those on the watch list, I think people are doing pretty good.
Sumit Preet - Banc of America Securities: Alright, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Martin with Cantor Fitzgerald. Go ahead, please.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald.: Good afternoon, everybody.
Tom Lewis: How are you doing?
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald.: Just a bit on Crest, and Tom you made some very good comments on Crest, and I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper here. I understand that you need to be very environmental with Crest and how much inventory you have out there for sale given it's being tough for the potential buyer. But does being wary with Crest, which again I think is appropriate, does that impact or negatively impact your ability to do acquisitions? 
Tom Lewis: That's a great question. We've used Crest very effectively with acquisitions. They do very large ones and remained diversified, so I say it might keep us from going out today and taking on a very, very large acquisition. But what we did during I think two or three quarters last year, and what we did during the first quarter or the fourth quarter, and we are doing the first quarter this year. Since they are not huge acquisitions, we are going in and really sitting down with the tenants and structuring them so that we can take them all on balance sheet and we have a high-comfort level because they are really don't want to put those things out there with Crest. And let me kind of walk through that again because I think it is important. Crest has worked great for us. We've I think since 2000 bought and sold 240 properties there and made a lot of money on it, and it’s been great and very, very profitable. But before we all get carried away with that kind of flip business, I think it was an environment where we all should have done very well. It's been a very easy environment. We have all been into declining cap rate environment really from 2003 to 2007. Cap rates fell about 150 to 200 plus basis points, which meant you are out there buying these things holding for 6 to 8 months then selling them, and while you are holding them, your inventory is getting marked up. Your spreads are a little wider than you thought, and so even when you make a mistake it pretty well works for you. I would also note that if you look at that period, think back on how easy financing was, versus where it is today and that's a double edged sword that makes your buyer easier for him to finance the transaction, but also means that the in the 1031 market there were a lot of gains that were had by people who were selling, who ended coming out and buying Net Lease properties. So I really think it was a period in the business, which we obviously took advantage of where pretty much everybody who got in it was looking like a world class athlete out there. And I think if you are looking at, look at it in a rising cap-rate market you have the reverse, your spreads are going to get squeezed. If they loop too much, you can loose your spread and go negative on the spread. And if you look at the impairment rules from an accounting standpoint, you go negative on the spread. It’s a mark-to-market business, so there is really more risk in that business than it looks like in good times, and so it’s just something as we look at our business today to get down with just a few properties in there. And then also probably out of the business, so we get clarity and better financing. I think it makes a lot of sense. So that’s basically what it is. So that means maybe I wouldn’t do a $350 million deal where I have to put $60 million in Crest, but I might do it at $60 million $80 million or a $100 million or $120 million, but it will be back with the retailers structuring at where we are comfortable maybe eliminating some assets from the deal with them, but in this environment where capitals hard to come by, we're finding the retailers are willing to work with this on that and happy to have the capital.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald.: Okay. So it sounds like the retailers are loosening up a bit here and allowing you maybe the cheery pick a bit to help get at least part of a deal done, and is there a potential to work with, let’s say, the number-two bidder on a deal, or maybe you come out victorious on the bid, but the number-two or number-three bidder, maybe they take some other properties, i.e. take some of other risks that you don’t want is there that that type of negotiating and structuring potential out there?
Tom Lewis: I think there is, but then again you're down just a couple or three players that we see showing up today, and I am not sure it’s a few, but larger transactions, but I think that potential exists out there. But it really is telling over the last month or so as we've been talking to people how you probably had 5 or 6 people in the food business that were out there doing a lot of us withdrawn, and the couple of the people that were doing larger portfolios they really haven’t been out there active currently. And as you know any time you're running some type of process, and you have 5, 6 bidders, it goes really well, and when you get down the one it’s a different process, so -- 
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald.: That’s right. 
Tom Lewis: So it’s really different today, and given the cap rates are moving. I think it’s kind of like you saw in housing, when prices started going down, people don’t like the [sticker shot], so they back off, transaction volume drops, they back off until they have to do something, and then they are kind of trying to capture price that they tend to like the market and then you see rates moving or prices moving pretty fast, and that's really been what we've seen lately. We started talking to somebody and you can see the price stock move fairly quickly as people have been exiting the market. And I don't want to say this is a fourth quarter event it's really a January event, and it's really the last three- or four-weeks event.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald.: Okay. Well, I know it's a very fluid environment, that's for sure. Last question I had is just with respect to the first half of the year here -- well, really the first half of '08. It sounds like it's going to be a reasonably robust year in terms of acquisitions, and again a very fluid acquisition and lending environment. What's driving these acquisitions, or maybe a better way to ask that, what are the different drivers today versus a year ago driving these transactions and driving the robust growth that you're going to have in the first half?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, I think the growth in the first half was really having some low-price capital in the fourth quarter that we could put out, and that will get us off to a very good start. I think after that with us it's kind of sitting back, and I want to watch the market for a while here, and we if we did that for a couple of months, we could step back in and wouldn't have to a tremendous amount of business to hit what we've got in our guidance of $250 million, so we could have a lot of patients here. I think what's driving the market, last year there was a lot of M&A. You don't see those transactions being announced, but there is some that's still haven't been financed. Secondarily, if you look at M&A activity over the last four, five years a lot of that was done with mortgage financing and other types of financing that was not long-term. And so I think you're going to see some of that burning off and a need to refinance into a market where rates aren't as attractive, but quite frankly I think that volume will decline relative to the number of deals but participants will decline pretty substantially, and then its a question of when can you get price stock stabilized. It’s a lot like looking at the unsecured bar market out there for reach today. You can get quotes from the desk, but I think whoever is out there early on, the price discovery is going to be really interesting. And so I think there is going to be a little bit of game of chicken going on for a few months here with some price discovery, and then I think it will be just a thing people coming out and need to do something in the market place, and I think there will be enough of that really from deals done in the past or deals that need to be refinanced. It really won't take a lot of M&A activity to cause a number of transactions to happen.
Paul Meurer:   Phil, you have heard it say for couple of years now that we felt like our primary competitor in the market was the debt product, maybe even as opposed to other net-lease providers, and so Tom's comments on some level of lessening competition doesn’t just include the net lease providers, but the debt product becoming more difficult for the retailer and the private equity firm involved to access on a cheap, cost-effective basis. Whether there will be a leverage-loan bid from Wall Street or CNBSS product or even a bank-financing product. So they have a near-term obligation in some nature it makes the [Telly's] backed capital an intriguing option for them to consider and perhaps will help us as the balance-year progresses.
Tom Lewis: And I would say Philip, I can have three scenarios: scenario number one, and I will give it a one third rating, which is we do a fair amount here in the first and second quarter, and then we sit back and through the balance of the year just do a little bit more and do the two fifty if the market stays very unstable. I would give a third waiting to saying that it stay really tough out there, and we are able to go out and do a little bit beyond that, but it’s a very good rate. And then I would say a third of it, who knows? Maybe things get back to normal, you come in the second half of the year, and it’s kind of like the few years. Although I am not sure I would wait that one a third.
Philip Martin - Cantor Fitzgerald: Okay. Well, thanks for the comment, and given your strong position, you have to be pretty excited about the opportunities that maybe out there, but it’s certainly important to kind of take a step back and pause a bit actually in this environment, so thanks again. 
Tom Lewis: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Paolone with J.P. Morgan. Go ahead please.
Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan: Thanks. Good afternoon. On the FAS yesterday, they had announced like 50 some odd store closures. Do you know if you all were affected by that, or were the numbers you gave out current?
Tom Lewis: I think they are current, Tony. At the filing they had all of our properties open and operating, and we've been watching, and I believe that still through of a 116 we own in the portfolio. I have not checked this morning, it’s kind of fluid. So I maybe off by one or two, but I really don’t think so, we haven’t been notified of any of our properties in the portfolio being closed. We have someone there in the court everyday, and we have some more working on this. They did put out a case for anybody else to see last night, but they called 52 stores over the last couple of days before that. They have 626 stores so in a re-organization. It doesn’t surprise me that they might take that action, but we believe the majority of 116 of our stores are good stores and profitable. I can also say that they did by the way early in the bank schedule rejected on a schedule b24 properties -- none of those were ours, but that was a few weeks ago. I will say also that they are current with their lease payment on all of our properties and that includes this month, which is February, which means the payment it’s just last week, and I think a good way to absorb it, it doesn’t make sense to pay rent one week and then close the store a few days later or they close them altogether if they are profitable stores. And again based on the analysis that we have our own, I think we're going to fairly well here with a 116 stores there will be a few things happening on a few of them.
Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And with respect to the 24% of your revenues coming restaurant, today's biggest can you maybe tell us Q3 and Q4 might be, or just even like how big those are?
Paul Meurer: Yeah, relative to size, I'm taking a second here. I won't if you know is our policy do the name remain, but we have another restaurant chain it's about 4.5%, and then I think the next one is 3%, then next one it 3% and then it falls below 2%, so it's pretty well diversified.
Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then just from an accounting point of view, maybe Paul, give us a sense as to if retail environment gets more difficult, and you start to see some of that stuff happening? How does it work in terms taking credit reserve to stronger revenues?
Paul Meurer: We have actually on a regular kind of basis accrue essentially a bad-debt expense figure to largely account for that based on kind of historical experience. I did mention that the property expense line item for us for example, we don't expect to be increased or if it will or increase slightly. The way you play that out thinking-wise is you get something back, it's vacant, and you actually get handed the keys back let's say you then become responsible for the taxes maintenance and insurance of that property. And then you have that carrying cost for that time, and so you get another tenant in there. And so that would increase your expenses a bit, but we're already kind of budgeting for that a bit. We always do, if you will, to have a handful of the situation in any given year. And then on beyond that the only other piece you might see if you had any further firm-maintenance issue is your capital expenditures might go up a little bit? If for some reason that made sense that you needed to put a few dollars in it to get a new tenant in, to retro fit it for different type of use or something of that nature. But again we don't expect the expenses to be very large.
Tom Lewis: And there is not, Tony, there is not a lot of large accruals relative to rent. The rent comes in every month, then you get it or you don't get it. If you don't get it, you know what the situation is. If it is, the re-organization typically you will get administrative rent during the period, so when you get it back and then you just hook the current revenue on the property. So any accruals really is -- there may be some percentage rents due at the end of the year, but they are fairly small. So if there is not really a lot you have to reserve there. It is pretty much current-pay business.
Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan: Okay. But for instance, your '08 guidance and budgeting, then you would have just a normalized amount of bad debt reserves being taken out of your P&L already?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, but again it’s very, very little. What we do have in there for guidance is what we are looking at property expense you get a run rate for vacancy, you run it up a little bit, you look at taxes, maintenance, insurance, but it is not a big number.
Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then last question, thinking out a little bit further: if the capital markets would remain difficult, and the time that you spend a lot of money in the first half, you start going to the back half. How do you think about your business in terms of finding out what's capital rate do you look to secured debt or just what do you do?
Tom Lewis: Yeah, our way of looking at it has always is pretty conservative. We do not look to secure debt. We have unsecured way of preferred and we have equity. I don't think we want to put any unsecured debt on the books. We have someone room with preferred that markets is open, but you would want to look at the rate see where it is, and really make sure when you are doing a transaction that you are mass funding what you are doing so that you maintain your spread, and I think that’s going to be the theme going into the late second quarter and in the balance of the year is it’s really going to be a mass spread discussion with your tenant, because putting a lot of acquisitions on the books on the credit line and then thinking that five or six months down the road you're going to go out and do your capital markets event, I think its really, really putting yourself out there and probably not a smart way to run the business. We have a lot of capital right now, but even relative to what we have on the line, I think it will come to a point where we're going to have to be having cap rates above where we see current loss to capital looking at equity or looking at preferred, and we'll just operate in that manner and only put capital out when there is a big spread. There is no sense putting capital out just to put it out if you are not going to get paid to do it.
Anthony Paolone - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from [Andy Gigiowel] with Citigroup. Go ahead, please. 
Andy Gigiowel - Citigroup:  Hi. Can you go over - I am not sure if you have this information, but do you know the rent coverage for the Buffets that they have announced at their closing, and maybe how that compares Buffet’s overall coverage?
Paul Meurer: We only have rent coverage on our property, and because since they are not the one to closes we don’t, but you can pretty well assume that when our retailer and I will speak generically, you are also Buffet’s is in chapter 11, and they are closing stores the vast majority of them are down around one and below.
Andy Gigiowel - Citigroup: Okay. Great.
Paul Meurer: Typically why they closed them because they are generating a lot of EBITDA above rents then obviously for the creditor committee and the corporate makes sense for them to operate those properties so that they can capture that cash flow.
Andy Gigiowel - Citigroup: Okay. And then just more logistical, but how is the administrative rent-period work, and given that this is going to take about couple of quarters to sort through, how can we be comfortable with the tax rate, and in the meantime Buffet’s will continue to pay their rent, or is that something that up in the air? I know that there is a administrative rent period, but I'm not sure logistically how that works out.
Tom Lewis: Sure. The logistics is from the day they file to when they reject a property, they have to pay administrative rent, and so they do so and once they reject, they rejected it, you get the keys back, and they don't pay it anymore. So it's really the way and rather than talk about Buffet’s and bankruptcy here, chapter eleven reorganization generically is during that period they pay administrative rent, pay the rent, recurring on it, and then they either accept the lease in which case you keep getting paid, and you get paid post bankruptcy and in the future and nothing happens, or you get reject, and at that point you get your keys back and you are back to the property. Under the new bankruptcy law, it was passed a couple of years ago, I think the initial period they have to make the decision with the real state is 120 days. I don't think they can go into the court, and if they can show a good reason to the judge, he can give them another 90-day extension, but that is the period that they have to reject or accept. Obviously, I think there could be another 90-day period after that, but at that point I think it would take consent of the landlord under reorganization laws. So essentially once you are in, it's administrative rent unless it's rejected, and then you are off with it, and I'll just say once again given that we have very profitable units for the most part on the portfolio. We anticipate that we'll get paid.
Andy Gigiowel - Citigroup: Right. Is there any possibility that administrative rent is not there to cover the current rent, or is that just not an option?
Tom Lewis: Yeah. Generally that's the chapter-seven liquidation in an eleven. As soon as you file, there is some financing that usually can be arranged, and there usually is capital available, and that's really part of process that you have it available because they really need to. Eleven a lot of times, the people are going into because they need to have their vendors be able to shift the stuff so the store is remained opened, so that is the idea and in eleven they reorganize around the profitable stores, may have to be able to make their payments during their process to do so.
Andy Gigiowel - Citigroup: Okay. And then given that you feel comfortable with your current Buffet’s exposure, I guess, is there a possibility that Buffets comes back during those -- we are in chapter eleven, can we renegotiate the rent, how does that process potentially work?
Tom Lewis: I will stay away from commenting on Buffet’s, and I'll comment on 15, 16, 17 once we've done over the last 20 years, and the process. Typically what will happen is they will file, and then there is administrative rent, and then they go through a process first of all of hiring people to work with them on looking at their stores, and very quickly they will get an idea of what the profitable stores are that they know that they are going to keep, and they get administrative rent. They kind of push those off to the side. They then analyze all the other stores and they then they start going back to the landlords and talking about their situation and trying to negotiate lower rent. But in the end it really comes to the point where when you have a store that's not generating any EBITDA. They will most likely reject it because it doesn't pay them, and this our opportunity to rationalize the real estate. However, if there is a moderate amount of the EBITDA that's been generated by the store, they probably, if they can have it produced or want to keep the store open and capture that, and so there might be some negotiations going on, but it really is between the two parties as to whether they can come to than agreement. And then on those stores that are very profitable, if the landlord knows they are very profitable, then obviously the negotiations takes on a very different tenure. But that is fairly typical in all of these gone we've gone through, and we kind of going back four or five years, there will be a call made here, and the guy making the call for the real estate consultancy they hired knows I had a portfolio management [my car goes] hi Dick, how you are doing? I'm doing good. And how is the family. May I give you my speech, and he does and then we give them our speech, and then we start talking about how profitable the stores are and we get down to what's really going to happen. And it really the starts we are dealing itself is a function of how the stores look and how profitable they are and we've been through this many times.
Andy Gigiowel - Citigroup: Okay, that makes sense. And then maybe you went through this earlier and I missed it, but on guidance you do have a large cash balance, and LIBOR has come down. I guess, what's the offset to the lower LIBOR or with lower LIBOR probably assumed increase this guidance. You could just give a little color on that?
Paul Meurer: Yeah, LIBOR is what we borrow on our line, and we haven't had any borrowings on the line, and we've had a lot of cash sitting around. So, the really differential with the cash fitting around, as we issued the borrowings at a 677, and then we've had the money parked basically in short-term treasuries that have yielded early in the fourth quarter 4%, and now we're down around 2%. So, we really don't have cost relative to borrowing day, but it's the negative spread between the cash that we are holding on the balance sheet. And so we did it out and that's a couple of quarters worth, and then we'll get the benefit of actually having fixed our borrowing cost maybe 100-plus basis points below what we'd have borrowed today, and we get that benefit for the next 12 years.
Andy Gigiowel - Citigroup: So, I guess what -- had you assumed that the short-term market rates would have come down and therefore impacted your interest net income. I guess what's the offset to the lowest-interest income is it the fact that when you [refi] the $100 million later in '08 that you are going to pay that down on the line and that will be lower interest expense.
Paul Meurer: Yeah (inaudible) it's the opposite. We don't have a nickel on the line.
Tom Lewis: You have no borrowings.
Paul Meurer: No borrowings whatsoever on the line, and a $193 million of cash sitting on the balance sheet, where we got that cash from issuing bonds in September, and we're paying 6.77% on an average balance of $230 million during the fourth quarter. And then we've taken that cash average balance $230 million, put it in short term treasuries, and that has yielded us about 3%. So, there has been about a 370-basis point negative spread on the $230 million average during the fourth quarter. So, that reduced our FFO during the first quarter by a couple of cents and to the extent, we've balances during the first quarter, we'll reduce that. But then as soon as obviously we buy properties, all of a sudden now we're getting an 86-cap rate of that money and we're paying 6.77% and the spread reverses, and obviously we'll have a much lighter spread than if we had not raised all that money in September, and we're out trying to raise it today if we could.
Andy Gigiowel - Citigroup: Right. I guess just to clarify on what I'm asking is because rates have come down the interest income is less. What's offset the lower interest income?
Paul Meurer: The offset the interest income is lower so we're receiving less, but we're still paying out the 6.77 however we're buying the bunch of property.
Tom Lewis: It's investment in new properties.
Andy Gigiowel - Citigroup: Okay. So, is it higher cap basically you're saying that the cap rates on your acquisitions are increased based upon your previous expectations?
Paul Meurer: No it's just that we're putting the money out earlier than we thought…
Andy Gigiowel - Citigroup: Okay.
Paul Meurer: We're going to put it out. And generally as you know, we plan in our guidance $250 million acquisition we kind of weighted equally throughout the year at the end of each quarter. But if we put a fair amount of that out early in the year the impact, particularly when the cash would have been sitting on the balance sheet it's pretty dramatic relative to the FFO.
Tom Lewis: This may help answer your question [in details]. When we sat here on November 1, and gave you estimates we assumed that what we would earn from an interest-income standpoint, and raise investment of that money would be lower in '08 would go down from where they are kind of the 4% we were earning in the fall.
Andy Gigiowel - Citigroup: Okay, great.
Tom Lewis: Because we already assumed that at that time does that help answering you---
Andy Gigiowel - Citigroup: Yes, that answers my question. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Fick with Stifel Nicolaus. Go ahead please.
David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus: Good afternoon.
Tom Lewis: Hi, David.
David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus: Most of my questions have been answered. I do want to go back one of our phase question, and I recognized that both you feel you've it in hand and that you're fairly well protected. But can you just review for us when you entered into that acquisition and what your underwriting thought process was at the time without the help of a base?
Paul Meurer: Yeah I - again, given the confidentiality agreements, it's going to be mindful of that David. But it was a pretty typical one for us. We started working on that in early '06 -- it was closed in late '06. It was an M&A process that was going on whereby our phase was being hold, and we had talked to several potential acquirers and looked fairly deeply at the portfolio at the company, at the possible combinations with a various buyers relative to business plan number of various financial structures and different prices for the real estate. As that process went on we did not -- one of the buyers, we worked with did not win the process another buyer won, and they had a sale-leaseback provider, and we talked to that provider, and we took part of the portfolio, and they took part of the portfolio, we had done that before with another transaction. And as we did the final due diligence coming in really through late fall, what we're looking at was the combination of the Ryan's and the Buffets. We were looking at obviously when you get an M&A combination, somebody would have hoped for cost savings. We're also looking at the restaurant industry, which we actually thought would weaken and took our position on that. Time of buying the real estate what we thought was a very attractive price. Replacement costs we figured that was $2.8 million to $3.5 million a copy, and if you just do the math on what we announced relative to buying, we were in it about $2.6 million. We thought the rents were reasonable, and we thought that the cash flow coverages on the property we'd be able to buy would be significant enough that if there was a downturn that we'd be protected or said in another way that the margin of safety was significant enough, where we'd be in good shape if adverse circumstances availed itself and they have.
David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus: But clearly if you would seen a VK coming you are going to put yourself in front of that?
Paul Meurer: No, let me stop you there, David. I'll tell you in our underwritings, we assume in every underwriting given that we're going to owned properties for 20 years that management will change, balance sheet will change and at some point there can be an event. Now, if we think the event is imminent, we do view the underwriting differently. But it was underwritten from a standpoint of seeing that happen. I'd recall for you back in 2000, we did a good size transaction with Regal Cinema, understanding that at some point that they might have a filing which they subsequently did. In this case, we did not think there would be a filing. We thought that they would be able to operate the business. But that is something that is inherent in the underwriting of these assets, when we do them.
David Fick - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes our question-and-answer session. And I'd like to turn the conference back over to management. Go ahead please.
Tom Lewis: Great. As I know, it's the busy earning season for everybody, and we really appreciate the time and effort that you have put in. And we look forward to talking to you at upcoming conferences and on future calls. Thank you very much. And thanks much for your help.
