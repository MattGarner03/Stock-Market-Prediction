===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the First Quarter 2025 Halliburton Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. At this point I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Coleman. Sir, please begin.
David Coleman: Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton first quarter 2025 conference call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentations section of our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Well thank you David and good morning everyone. I will begin today’s discussion with our highlights from the first quarter. We delivered total company revenue of $5.4 billion and adjusted operating margin of 14.5%. International revenue was $3.2 billion a decrease of 2% year-over-year due to lower activity in Mexico. Excluding Mexico international revenues grew by mid single digits. North America revenue was $2.2 billion, 12% lower than the first quarter of 2024. Finally, during the first quarter we generated $377 million of cash flow from operations, $124 million of free cash flow, and repurchased approximately $250 million of our common stock. Before we take a closer look at our geographic results, I'd like to take a moment and talk about the macro environment for oil and gas. The last three weeks have been highly dynamic as the trade environment injected uncertainty into markets, raised broad economic concerns and along with faster than expected return of OPEC production weighed on commodity prices. These market forces impact us all, but here's what I know to be true. First, oil and gas will play a fundamental role in global economic growth and prosperity. Second, the world is consuming more oil and gas than ever before. And finally, decline curves are real and in many basins significant. And adequate supplies today do not guarantee adequate supplies tomorrow with our ongoing investments. Given these realities, I know that our technology will continue to transform the industry and it will unlock new sources of value for us and our customers. I know our unique collaborative approach improves outcomes and deepens customer relationships. And finally, I know that safety and service quality formed the cultural bedrock of Halliburton and they are key differentiators to our customers. On that note, I would like to take a moment to thank the Halliburton employees for their outstanding safety and service quality performance last quarter. I firmly believe that despite recent pressures on the energy macro, Halliburton's consistent focus on technology, collaboration, and service quality execution create value for our customers and drive long term success for Halliburton under any market conditions. Turning to our results, I'll begin with the international markets where Halliburton delivered solid quarterly revenue of $3.2 billion. As I look at the balance of this year, while our overall international outlook has not materially changed, it is reasonable to assume that there is more risk embedded in our outlook today than three months ago. As a result, I expect our year-over-year international revenue to be flat to slightly down. Our Q1 international tender activity remains strong. Halliburton won meaningful work extending through 2026 and beyond. Customers awarded Halliburton several contracts that demonstrate the strength of our value proposition and the power of our service quality execution. Shell awarded Halliburton significant scopes of work this quarter, including development and intervention work for Gato do Mato in Brazil and exploration work in Suriname and West Africa. Halliburton also won additional integrated offshore exploration work with another major in Suriname. These integrated offshore contracts rely on Halliburton's advanced technologies, like our intelligent completions and comprehensive directional drilling technology, including the iCruise and LOGIX drilling automation and remote operation platform, among multiple other well-construction, reservoir evaluation, and intervention product clients. Furthermore, I expect that projects like these awarded based on the demonstrated execution of our value proposition will be the core of how Halliburton wins integrated work with customers. Our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers resonates with customers and is directly tied to our company culture. It is core to our competitive advantage and I am pleased it is winning in the marketplace. In addition to these offshore examples, our international growth engines also delivered in Q1. Over the next several years, we expect these engines, unconventional, artificial lift, intervention and directional drilling to grow faster than other parts of our business. To give you a few examples of our progress in these areas, in unconventional, we mobilized Zeus equipment to the Middle East and expect trials in the near term. In artificial lift, we were direct awarded new offshore work in Ghana and we expect strong double-digit international growth in this product line in 2025. In intervention, we closed the acquisition of Optime Subsea, a technology we expect will transform deep water interventions. And finally, in directional drilling, with our partners, we delivered a first closed loop automated drilling system and drilled the well with it in Norway. Then we did it again in the Middle East. To summarize international markets, we had a solid start in 2025. Our first quarter contract awards add visibility and give me confidence for this year and beyond. Our growth engines are strong. In my discussions with customers, tell me we are focused on the right things, collaboration, execution, and technology, and I am confident in the future of our international business. Turning to North America, our first quarter revenue increased 1% sequentially. Seasonal increases in frack activity were offset by seasonal declines in Gulf of America completion tool sales. Looking forward, many of our customers are in the midst of evaluating their activity scenarios and plans for 2025. Activity reductions could mean higher than normal white space for committed fleets and in some cases the retirement or export of fleets to international markets. Nevertheless, I expect Haliburton to outperform the North America services market and I believe this because our clear strategy to maximize value in North America has demonstrated success under a variety of market conditions. Our Zeus fleets, which represent more than 40% of our overall frack fleet, operate under term contracts. And finally, our technology is highly differentiated and drives value for our customers. Haliburton's recognized leadership was on display recently when in partnership with our customer range resources and others we were honored to host Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum on a field visit in Pennsylvania. The visit featured our Zeus electric frack equipment, which we proudly build in Duncan, Oklahoma, and demonstrated the industry's ability to deliver reliable and affordable energy in the United States and around the world. We were pleased to host Secretary Burgum and I was energized by his vision and support for advancing American energy. I am also excited by the adoption of our latest technologies, which are a cornerstone of our strategy to maximize value in North America. In the first quarter, we achieved a significant milestone with the successful completion of the first closed loop autonomous fracturing operation in the world. To put it plainly, closed loop means that the Zeus platform utilizes real-time feedback from the reservoir that directs pump activity to control where water and sand are placed all without human intervention, effectively reading and responding to the reservoir. I expect that this technology, known as Zeus IQ, will change the game in unconventional. I believe Zeus IQ provides customers both the measurements and controls critical to their journey to improve productivity and production for lateral foot. I am excited about the future of this technology and we have several other deployments now underway. I would like to thank our Zeus IQ customers for sharing our vision and bringing this technology to the forefront. We look forward to our continued collaboration to improve asset performance with this unique technology. To finish my thoughts on North America, our strategy to maximize value is unchanged. This strategy means we focus on returns not shared. Our plan is to retire or reallocate equipment rather than operate it on economic levels. We focus on safety, service quality, and efficiency. We maintain equipment and invest in training. I am confident that our customers value our execution and it differentiates Haliburton in this market. We lead technology innovation in North America, which means we develop technologies that maximize the value of our customers' assets and deploy them at scale. Before I turn the call over to Eric, let me close with this. I am confident in our strategy to maximize value in North America, drive our growth engines internationally, and deliver technology that creates value for our customers and Haliburton. I expect Haliburton generates solid free cash flow in 2025 and we are on pace to return at least $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. With that, I will now turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?
Eric Carre: Thank you, Jeff and good morning. Our Q1 reported net income per diluted share was $0.24. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.60. Total company revenue for Q1 2025 was $5.4 billion, a decrease of 7% when compared to Q1 2024. Adjusted operating income was $787 million and adjusted operating margin was 14.5%. During the quarter, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $356 million as a result of severance costs, impairment of assets held for sale, and real estate, and other items primarily related to legacy environmental reserves. We expect our cost rationalization efforts to be supportive of our margins going forward. Now turning to the segment results. Beginning with our completion and production division, revenue in Q1 was $3.1 billion, a decrease of 8% when compared to Q1 2024. Operating income was $531 million, a decrease of 23% when compared to Q1 2024, and operating income margin was 17%. These results were primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping activity and lower completion tool sales in the western hemisphere. In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue in Q1 was $2.3 billion, a decrease of 6% when compared to Q1 2024. Operating income was $352 million, a decrease of 12% when compared to Q1 2024, and operating income margin was 15%. These results were primarily driven by decreased activity in Mexico and Saudi Arabia. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q1 international revenue decreased 2% year-over-year. Europe Africa revenue in Q1 was $775 million, an increase of 6% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by improved activity across multiple product service lines in Norway and higher well construction activity in Namibia. Middle East Asia revenue in Q1 was $1.5 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year. This improvement was due to higher activity across multiple product service lines in Kuwait and improved completion and production performance in Saudi Arabia. Latin America revenue for Q1 was $896 million, a 19% decrease year-over-year, primarily due to lower activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico. In North America, Q1 revenue was $2.2 billion, a 12% decrease year-over-year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower stimulation activity in U.S. land and decreased completion tool sales in the Gulf of America. Moving on to other items, in Q1 our corporate and other expense was $66 million. We expect our Q2 corporate expenses to be about flat. In Q1, we spent $30 million or about $0.03 per diluted share on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For Q2, we expect SAP expense to be about flat. Net interest expense for the quarter was $86 million. For Q2, we expect net interest expense to increase about $5 million. Other net expense for Q1 was $39 million. For Q2, we expect this expense to increase about $5 million. Our normalized effective tax rate for Q1 was 22.1%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. Capital expenditures for Q1 were $302 million. For the full year 2025, we expect capital expenditures to be about 6% of revenue. Our Q1 cash flow from operations was $377 million and free cash flow was $124 million. Moving on to other items that will impact free cash flow, we're following the trade situation closely. While the situation is fluid, our initial estimates are for an impact of about $0.02 to $0.03 per share in the second quarter, which is included in our guidance. We will provide an estimate of the full year impact next quarter. Now, let me provide you with comments on our expectations for Q2. In our completion and production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to increase 1% to 3% and margins to remain approximately flat. In our drilling and evaluation division, we expect revenue to be flat to down 2% and margins to decline 125 to 175 basis points, primarily due to the seasonal roll off of software sales and higher mobilization expenses related to contract start-ups. I would now turn the call back to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. Here are the key points I would like you to take away from our discussion today. While there is more uncertainty in the market than there was three months ago, Haliburton's consistent execution of our strategy has driven results that give me confidence that Haliburton will continue to outperform. In international markets, we had a solid start in 2025 with significant contract awards and strong delivery on our growth engines. Our value proposition resonates with customers, and I expect it to deliver further incremental wins throughout the year. In North America, we have expanded our technology leadership with the Zeus IQ closed loop autonomous frack system. I am confident our unique technologies and high percentage of contracted fleets will drive our outperformance in the North America market. Finally, I firmly believe Haliburton's consistent focus on technology development, collaboration, and service quality execution will create value for our customers and drive long-term success for Haliburton and our shareholders through any market. And now let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question or comment comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, sir.
Neil Mehta: Yeah, good morning, Jeff and team, and thank you for the time here. A couple of North America questions.
Jeff Miller: Good morning Neil.
Neil Mehta: Good morning Jeff. A couple of North America questions. You spend a lot of time with your customer base in between these calls. And we've had a lot of volatility in the last couple of weeks. But as you think about U.S. activity through the balance of the year, if we stay in this type of commodity price environment, how do you think about the rig count and the completion count and what type of oil price do you think would really change customer behavior in a meaningful way?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, thanks, Neil. Look, I think that customers right now are working through that. I mean, a lot's happened in three weeks. It's been a busy three weeks from a commodity price standpoint and also tariffs and what that might mean. So yeah, talk to customers all of the time, but what we really see are customers digesting information, I think duration is a part of that thinking as well. And so look, when I think about the market in activity, sort of in the 60s, I think some important things are going on. One, from our perspective, anyway, the market's not building new equipment. So I think that we're in a good place there. I think that activity itself, if it slows down, much starts to have a production impact as well. And so I think that's a bit of a governor on what does activity do? I think we're in some sort of range here and it's not -- but I think it'll get digested, but the types of operators in North America are biased to working through things. I think largely today, as opposed to what we've seen in the past. And I think that much of a decline in activity, then it's sort of underpinned pretty quickly by its impact on production.
Neil Mehta: Thanks, Jeff. Well C&P’s report in the next couple weeks we'll definitely be asking the same question. And then, you mentioned Mexico a couple of times in the prepared remarks, and it had impacts on margins, it looks like, in both C&P and D&E. So, just give us a lay of the land there, how do you think about the trajectory over the course of this year into 2026, and do you see a path to resolution?
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks. And look, and I was just there meeting with Victor Padia, the new CEO and have spent some time with them. Clearly not settled at this point as we look forward. And I think they have a plan, but I also think that it's going to be tough for a while. And I say tough for a while, I don't see immediate recovery in Mexico. Just as the new administration and they make themselves work through, what does all of this mean. But I do know this, and what's very important is oil and gas to the economy of Mexico. And so I do expect they find their footing. At some point, it's too early to call when that point is. But I do think the decline rates are pretty meaningful in that market. And I think that, that's going to drive recovery. I wish I were clear around the timing on that, Neil. But I do believe they're working through what plants are, but obviously the execution of those plants are dependent on a range of things, including kind of what the market does and what the performance does.
Neil Mehta: Okay, thanks Jeff, appreciate the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Your line is open.
J. David Anderson: Thank you very much. Jeff, maybe start with a question on Saudi. There's a little bit of some moving pieces in there. The simulation is about drilling a well construction down. Do you see Saudi growing in the Halliburton portfolio this year, there are a number of tenders for Jafurah to be announced, is that the big swing factor for the year, could you just talk about that within the context of flat international for the year, please? Thank you.
Jeff Miller: Sure. And I think that -- I mean, number one, Saudi is a huge market and we expect growth for our portfolio in 2025 in Saudi, just to be clear. I think there's some exciting opportunities. You mentioned one of them, but there are others. We do a lot in that market, certainly in Jafurah but beyond Jafurah like our performance there, like the opportunity to put technology to work there, both in unconventionals and other parts of the market. And so I think when I think about Saudi, that's one of those places where we are going to grow in those growth engines and we see a lot of -- well we have unique strength in those growth engines, whether it's unconventionals, intervention, and artificial lifts, see all three of those positively in Saudi as well. So I hope that clarifies that.
J. David Anderson: That's helpful. So good to see some positive stuff. I know a lot of concerns on the North American side. Eric, I want to ask you a bit more about the margin progression. Margins came down this quarter in both segments below the guidance that we were expecting. You just -- you're looking towards second quarter coming down again, usually, first quarter is the bottom. How are you thinking about kind of margin progression through the rest of the year, I'm particularly thinking about the context of white space in North America, particularly, I think most of your equipment is locked down, but help us understand kind of how margins how you're thinking about margins and maybe where we could exit the year from here? Thank you.
Eric Carre: Yes. So let me start with giving you a bit of a walk-through from Q1 to Q2, and then I'll give you a little bit of color on the full year margins by division. So if we look at Q2, as we guided for the -- starting with the C&P division, we're looking at fairly flat revenue in North America, but a pickup in our international business for the C&P division. Margin is flat. Keep in mind as well, that includes the tariff impact. When we look at tariffs, we kind of mentioned on the prepared remark, a $0.02 to $0.03 impact about 60% of that is in the C&P division, 40% of that is in the D&E division. So that's for C&P. On the D&E side of the business, it is really -- I mean, if you look at Q2 over Q1, we're basically dropping about $40 million in profits. And that can be explained fairly specifically. We have about $10 million in tariffs, $20 million in mobilization and that is incremental mobilization costs over Q1 as we get geared up for growth in the second half of the year in quite a few of the regions. And then we have $10 million, that's a mix issue with our software business coming down in Q1, our drilling business coming back up a bit, but the delta of that is about $10 million. So I think what's important to realize for the Q2 guidance is that the guidance is really not a new run rate is really a couple of specific items. If we think about the second half of the year to kind of give you some color there, we're at this stage forecasting that our second half 2025 the margin levels in Q3 and Q4 will be in the same ZIP code as they were in 2024. So that's kind of D&E. If we look at C&P, what we're not going to guide the year, the international business for C&P is about 40% of our business, 60% in NAM. As Jeff mentioned in the remarks and in a couple of comments here, we're expecting our growth engine to perform really well in the international market that's on the intervention, lift unconventional. A lot of these growth engines sit in the C&P division. For the North America business, it's a bit less clear as we explained in the prepared remarks.
Jeff Miller: Yes. And maybe I'll add some color because specifically regarding North America. I think I didn't mean that the customers are still digesting what precisely that means and at what price range and duration of commodity price. But that being said, I mean, we have a different-looking customer base today than we've ever had in the past, particularly given that Zeus, not only the contract terms but the who it works for and what it's able to do. I also know from a technology perspective that there's a lot of demand for the technology that we have. And we really have a different operating model than we've had going into any other period of time. Given the -- just the ability to move up, down to take a clear view on what's really required to perform the services and the automation continues to take cost out of the process for us. So again, a lot of digesting of data going on. But I think from our perspective, in a really strong position, certainly relative to the market.
J. David Anderson: Great, thank you Jeff and Eric.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Arun Jayaram: Yes, Jeff good morning. Jeff, I wanted to maybe see if you could elaborate on what you're seeing internationally. You highlighted how it's possible that international spending is down a little bit year-over-year, which is maybe a little bit softer than your previous outlook of relatively flat with obviously Mexico being a headwind. With OPEC clearly bringing on some barrels. Could you talk to us what parts of the non-OPEC food chain do you expect to see maybe some spending impacts?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, let me just start with how we see international with a little more specificity. And when I think about our operating plan today, it looks flat, I mean, sans Mexico. And then overall, it -- excuse me, overall looks flat with Mexico in there. But the key is we do see a bit more risk creeping into the models in the last three weeks or certainly the last three months. But when I think about non-OPEC parts of the world, Norway, we see a lot of activity. We see solid growth there. We've been quite successful in Brazil. This is where some of the mobilization cost is, both for P&A and for integrated drilling and then talked about the Shell integrated projects and other operators in Suriname. So it's really the deep collaboration model that I'm describing that is gaining work and just winning and developing different types of relationships. So when I think about how do you -- how do we land there. Look, I see the second half of the year, Europe and Africa, making the biggest jump in Q3 and that's with contract start-ups, and we see the Middle East growth engines, having an impact there, the growth engines in the Middle East. And then in Q4, Latin America has a pretty stout uplift as well just because we'll see the full quarter of the contract startups that we're mobilizing for in Q2 and that I've described.
Arun Jayaram: Great. That's helpful. Maybe one for Eric. Eric, I wanted to maybe zero in on the cash flow statement. You announced a $345 million equity investment, looks like a minor acquisition. So I was wondering if you could describe those two, plus you had about a $350 million outflow in other operating items. So maybe you could give us a little bit of color on those items in the cash flow statement?
Eric Carre: Yes. So there was one to start with the investing activities. There was one that was related to the Optime acquisition that we commented on. The second number, the $345 million relates to an increase in ownership in VoltaGrid, and I'll let Jeff elaborate on this one. Going back to the operating activities, the big item that you see in other operating activities is actually the combination of the typical incentive payout, cash tax payments, etcetera, but also the cash portion of our restructuring charge in Q1.
Arun Jayaram: Got it, got it. That’s helpful. Thanks a lot.
Jeff Miller: Yes. And I would just say with respect to the increased position in VoltaGrid this quarter, look, we like the power business. We have a front row seat through our exposure in the VoltaGrid investment, but we also see many other exciting opportunities for us in that space, but I want to be crystal clear, we're very prudent and it's one step at a time for us.
Arun Jayaram: Great, thanks a lot Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Roger Read: Yes, thank you and good morning. I was hoping Jeff, you can come back and give us a little more on the North American market and how Zeus and how you think Zeus IQ really ought to work in terms of -- you mentioned earlier, a changed customer mix a little bit, but how we should think about -- if you want to call it a growth opportunity, maybe not right now, but the way to sustain margins through this kind of softer period?
Jeff Miller: Look, thank you. And the key to Zeus IQ is just things we have been working on for some time. So in some ways, it's a culmination of Octave [ph] auto frac sensory, the ability to read the reservoir, control the equipment and then analyze in real time as they analyze, but solved for that and better than real time at the pace of AI time solve for where does the sand and the water need to go. And look, this precisely addresses what kind of the greatest challenge is in hydraulic fracturing, which is how to improve recovery rates and almost under any conditions, meaning what we know over time gets the grades, okay? The best rock gets fracked first. But how does that get read and manipulated and addressed in a way that creates better outcomes. And this is really important technology and the types of customers that are taking it up are the kind that have a very long view of North America, clearly appreciate the importance of recovery over a long period of time. And yes, I think it drives growth in even this market. We actually put a new Zeus fleet to work in Q1. And I think that it creates not just stickiness, but clearly, it creates more value, which is value that is close us.
Roger Read: Appreciate that. Eric, maybe a question for you on how we should think about uses of free cash flow in this environment. So obviously, dividend priority. But how are you thinking about the share repurchase side of things and what's the right way for us to think about that with the updated guidance?
Eric Carre: Yes. I mean at this stage, obviously, with the updated guide, we're looking at an overall free cash flow for the year, which is on the kind of lower end of what we had given some color on in Q1. But I really don't see anything today that changes our perspective on cash returns and buybacks. So we're still on a pace that is very similar to what it was last year.
Roger Read: Appreciate that, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Saurabh Pant from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Saurabh Pant: Hi, good morning Jeff and Eric.
Jeff Miller: Good morning Saurabh.
Saurabh Pant: Jeff or Eric, maybe I want to start with the tariff side of things. I know you said $0.02 to $0.03 impact on the second quarter and we'll get more color on the back half later on as you get more visibility, right, but maybe you can elaborate a little bit on what business is, what exact components or maybe I'm thinking business like chemicals and [indiscernible] specifically, what parts of your businesses are seeing the most impact from tariffs and then how are you looking to mitigate that going forward?
Eric Carre: Yes. So I'll take that one, Saurabh. So as we said, it's really early days. So we have reasonable visibility of what is going to happen in Q2, and that is about an impact of $0.02 to $0.03. And as we indicated, we are doing a lot of work on mitigating the impact of tariffs. We have a well-diversified supply chain. We have a lot of levers we can pull. But really to be more clear in terms of the overall impact, we need a bit more clarity and stability in the structure of tariffs so that we can really understand what levers we can pull and then what the overall outcome is going to be. So there's just a lot of moving parts right now, and I think we'll be able to give you more color in three months from now. In terms of the impact of product lines, I'm not going to go into a lot of details. But broadly speaking, we're looking at about 60% in C&P with some impact on our lift business, some chemicals, etcetera. 40% on our D&E business. You're looking at parts like colors for drilling and gun bodies [ph] for perforating business, that's the type of components that are being affected by tariff at this stage.
Saurabh Pant: Okay. Okay. Perfect. Eric, a quick clarification on that. I think in response to a prior question, you said for margins, D&E you think 3Q and 4Q margins can go back to the same ZIP code as last year. Does that include any of the tariff impacts reversing?
Eric Carre: Broadly speaking, yes, with what we know today. Yes.
Saurabh Pant: Okay. Okay. Perfect. I got it. And then, Jeff, quickly one for you on the international side of things. If I'm doing my math right, it sounds like Mexico might have been down 70%, 75%, which is a massive number year-over-year, right. But excluding that, I think you said mid-single digits rest of international, right. It's a pretty healthy growth considering the environment we are in. Maybe talk to what countries, what regions drove that growth, Jeff and what should we expect from those regions going forward?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, I think I mentioned that, but I think we'll see the solid jump in Europe, Africa in Q3 as we start a number of contracts in the Middle East. I expect our growth engines are kicking in as well, whether that's intervention, which is an important business for us in the Middle East as well as some activity start-up around lift in new countries. Again, we expect that that's a meaningful part of our business, and it's continuing to grow. And I think that we'll continue to see activity around drilling and I've described some of the drilling technology, but that becomes more and more meaningful. And then in Q4, we really see Latin America making a big step up. And again, very focused in Brazil, Argentina, a number of places where we have a very strong business. So I would say that Mexico certainly is the outlier. But very excited about our business and the type of -- it's really the strategic approach that we have around collaboration and maximizing asset value, which aligns us very well with our customers, creates opportunity for us. I expect we'll see more growth in the North Sea, maybe even outside of the Norwegian sector. So I think that for us, we see a great opportunity in the second half of the year.
Saurabh Pant: Okay, fantastic. No, it is good to see that momentum continue Jeff. Okay, I will turn it back. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Scott Gruber: Yes, good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning Scott.
Scott Gruber: Good morning. Jeff, you highlighted some emerging risk to second half activity. Eric, you reiterated CAPEX being about 6% of sales. Obviously, there's a bit of risk to sales. But at 6% of sales, your CAPEX is still trending above DD&A. Can you just speak to the need for spending above DD&A, is that really helping to drive the share gains that you're targeting, and what factors would cause you to adjust that rate of spend, I realize second half spending more impacts your fleet of tools in 2026 and therefore, reflects the 2026 outlook, but what factor caused you to kind of reconsider the rate of spend in the second half?
Eric Carre: Yes. So a couple of things on CAPEX. So there is a somewhat of a self-regulating element around CAPEX as we look at it as a percentage of revenue. So as revenue fluctuates over time the dollar CAPEX spend adjust to it. And I'm saying over time, intentionally in the sense that there is a time element there like most of the CAPEX that we are going to spend in 2024 is the result of orders that were placed in 2024. So there's -- it takes time to kind of adjust things. And we're probably not going to be able to adjust very much if the activity ends up changing. And as we said right now, most of the -- like international CAPEX, we're not seeing still the activity fairly flat. So if we adjust, we'll start adjusting really for 2026. The other thing to keep in mind as well that we have not qualified either is a potential impact on the CAPEX number coming from tariffs as some of the parts get incorporated into the capital build.
Jeff Miller: Yes. I guess I would follow that just a little bit of addition around that in terms of the technology that's generating the outperformance, whether it's in IWI or these growth engine areas, mean we are allocating capital to those things that are growing. And so we're very, very thoughtful about that, and that will allow us to adjust capital up and down over time. And so I would expect that we continue to be effective allocators of capital sort of under any conditions here.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate it. And turning back to VoltaGrid, what's the end game here with VoltaGrid, do you intend to just keep it as an equity investment or are you interested in ultimately becoming the majority owner, do you see benefits to how being the majority owner -- could you help accelerate the capture of non-oilfield work, more data center contracts, more industrial contracts, is there an international expansion angle that you could push forward as majority order, just kind of how do you think about that investment longer term?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, in my view, that's optionality. And so not predetermined on any direction, and I want to be clear that I'm not -- we're not. But again, that's one avenue that we're looking -- that we're participating in now. Obviously, I think that -- that's an opportunity for growth over time. We're going to address it prudently. As I said, we look at lots of options, not just that by any means. And we also are clear around what strategically, where does that distributed power go as opposed to is it one area or another. I think there are multiple areas that demonstrate some growth. But just chasing after the thing of the day, we're really, really careful not to do those things. And so again, prudence and sort of the kinds of things we do at Halliburton are always going to be deeply thought out and have an executable clear strategy around it. And right now, we see a lot of opportunity broadly in that area, and we want to keep those options wide open.
Scott Gruber: Appreciate the color Jeff and Eric. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Derek Podhaizer from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Derek Podhaizer: Hey, good morning. I just wanted to ask about your outlook for the gas basin activities. Maybe just if you could expand on how your conversations have progressed over the last three months. Just trying to think about the equipment market to service those areas. I mean we still have LNG takeaway, power and AI movement. Maybe just some overall comments around how you're seeing the gas markets progress now?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, I'm positive on the gas markets for sure. And I think that the structural change that you described, both power demand and LNG exports will continue to structurally drive more demand, which is going to increase activity in the gas markets. And I've had dialogue with gas operators. They certainly like the price where it is better than where it had been. We've come a long way. The strip today or at least the current price today is moving around, but I think some of that is as a result of a lot of the digestion of data that's coming at a high rate is having an impact on that. None of that changes though the structural demand for gas, which clearly is the most reliable, scalable and affordable form of power. And so I think we'll continue to see improvement there. But like I said for many quarters, I'm not going to pick the date that we see the inflection, but we have had more inbounds from gas operators than we've had in some time.
Derek Podhaizer: Got it. That's helpful. And this might be more of a bigger picture question, but I was thinking about last year when we were talking about the international cycle, you talked about Halliburton being better positioned in last cycle is talking about artificial lift chemicals. I mean now we have Deepwater offshore starting to pick up. So maybe if you could spend some time talking to us about Halliburton's position attacking this offshore cycle versus prior offshore cycle, just given the commentary you laid out in the release and on the call has been -- it's pretty strong. Your outlook seems pretty constructive. So maybe just some thoughts around your position this time around than prior cycles?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, I think it's technically, we're in a much better place than any other cycle, and that's why I described we're winning offshore exploration -- integrated offshore exploration work. Really all the contract wins, all of the contract wins I described are offshore projects, some development, some exploration. And I do that just to demonstrate from an example perspective, there are others, (a) how technical we are and why we are competing so well in the offshore space. That's one. And then second, the value proposition is really meaningful internationally or in Deepwater because the stakes are much higher, the alignment is much more important, the type of ways we work and plan together with our customers. Though the clarity around asset value, creating asset value for our customer creates amazing alignment. And culturally, we are aligned around delivering that which gives customers a lot of confidence that we're going to show up and do the best thing for them. We're going to be aligned with them. And so those two things put us in a very different position internationally and in Deepwater. And for that reason, I'm very -- I am optimistic around where we sit and how we will perform.
Derek Podhaizer: Great, appreciate the color. I will turn it back.
Jeff Miller: Yeah, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Doug Becker from Capital One. Mr. Becker, your line is open.
Douglas Becker: Thank you. Eric, I wanted to circle back to your comment that second half 2025 D&E margins would be in the same ZIP code as second half 2024. If I'm interpreting that correctly, it might imply about 300 basis points of margin improvement from the second quarter. So I wanted to make sure I got that right and if so, that still seems pretty aggressive even trying to take into account the unique caliber and growth drivers and just some seasonal improvement, so anything you could expand on the drivers there?
Eric Carre: No, you are correct. That is what I said. And again, you're looking at a significant impact from mobilization in Q2, and we're mobilizing equipment because we have won additional work. So all of that kind of go together. We'll have less cost as we get into the second half of the year. We'll have incremental work that we're mobilizing for. So that's what our operational forecast tells us at this point in time.
Douglas Becker: Does that assume any decrease in activity in the second half?
Eric Carre: That includes -- it reflects the forecast that we are seeing right now in terms of the top line. As Jeff indicated, there is obviously more uncertainty because of the macro picture right now. So if the macro picture has significant impacts on the international market, then that will differ, but that's not what we're seeing at this point in time.
Jeff Miller: Nor is that the feedback we're getting from customers internationally. That feedback is much clearer.
Douglas Becker: Got it. And then just very quickly on the severance charge, over $100 million in the first quarter, you had a $60 million or so severance charge in the third quarter. Just any color on how that might be helping on the margin front going forward?
Eric Carre: Yes. Overall, I would say that it is included in the guidance that we're giving. So that's how it will materialize itself. And then you can think about the overall severance impact to have a payback of less than one year.
Douglas Becker: Got it, thank you very much.
Jeff Miller: You are welcome.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro from Stifel. Your line is open.
Stephen Gengaro: Thanks. Good morning everybody. So two things for me. I think the first, when we think about sort of the evolution of the pressure pumping business over the last 5 to 10 years and the increased probably resiliency in margins. Can you talk about what you're seeing right now kind of on the pricing side and maybe even if there's any color you could give on how these longer-term contracts that are in place on e-fleets you may or may not kind of reprice on a quarterly or annual basis, are there any color you can give us there as we think about margin progression in C&P?
Jeff Miller: Well, look, we've continued to extend these contracts sort of throughout, and they continue to be price consistent with the value that they're creating including the technology that I've been describing. So look, I think that -- it is a much more resilient market for us, and that is, from a strategic perspective as why that happens. I was pretty clear in my remarks in terms of what maximized value looks like. And so I think it will be -- it's competitive, but at the same time, we decide a lot of what we do. And our view is it has to make a good return. And so with 40% and our target 50% being under contract and being at the high end of the technology range and the technology that goes with it, I think, puts us in a different position.
Stephen Gengaro: Okay, great. Thank you and then just a follow-up on the question that came up on VoltaGrid. One of the things that we're trying to understand better around Power Gen is the differentiation it brings. And given how I think the pressure -- market has become, if it's a word decommoditized over the last 10 years, how do you think about something like VoltaGrid and whether that's a more commoditized service and kind of something that they -- however, and as an entity has kind of been moving away from over time?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Well, obviously, something we think about. And when I think about strategic, obviously, I mean, competitive advantage, and that's one of the reasons we have a front row seat. But before we are taking these steps, I'll have to be crystal clear on how that competitive advantage is sustainable over the long term, which is precisely what I told you about frac in terms of -- we were committed to a differentiated business. We believe that technology drives sustainable differentiation in our case, given the investment in it. And so view that the same way. And ergo the reason we're sitting where we are.
Stephen Gengaro: Okay, great. Thank you for the color.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session for this call. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thank you, Howard. As we close out today's call, let me close with this. I'm confident in our strategy to maximize value in North America, drive our growth engines internationally, and deliver highly differentiated technology that creates value for our customers and Halliburton. I expect Halliburton generate solid free cash flow in 2025, and we are on a pace to return at least $1.6 billion of cash in 2025. I look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q4 2024 Halliburton Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
David Coleman: Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton fourth quarter 2024 conference call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly update any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included on our fourth quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentations section of our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2024 was a solid year for Halliburton. Here are the full year highlights. We delivered full year total company revenue of $22.9 billion. Our international business grew for the fourth year in a row with 6% year-over-year revenue growth led by Middle East/Asia, which delivered an increase of 8%. Our North America business declined 8% year-over-year, but outperformed the rig count and completion activity. Halliburton generated $3.9 billion of cash from operations and $2.6 billion of free cash flow. Finally, we repurchased $1 billion of our common stock and paid $600 million of dividends to our shareholders, representing a 60% return of free cash flow. Before we move on, I would like to thank our employees for their extraordinary work this year, delivering record performance in both safety and service quality. You, our employees, are the ones that deliver our value proposition every day, to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. Thank you for your commitment and hard work. Let me begin with my outlook for the industry and for Halliburton. I expect energy will continue to play a critical role in economic growth and prosperity and per capita energy consumption to grow for decades to come. We see this trend today as oil and gas consumption reached record highs alongside growth in renewable energy. I believe the accessibility, affordability and dependability of oil and gas are simply too compelling to ignore. I'm confident that as we move forward, the attitudes and approaches to hydrocarbon development will be pragmatic rather than idealistic. I believe there is no way we meet the energy demands around the world without oil and gas in large quantities for a long time and that gives me great confidence. This is a great environment for Halliburton and we begin the second half of this decade in a strong position with a transformed balance sheet, leading returns and strong free cash flow. In the years ahead, I am confident Halliburton will strengthen its competitive advantage and financial position for three fundamental reasons. First, the depth of our technology portfolio, combined with our global reach make Halliburton a leader in the global services marketplace. We focus our investments in market segments where our unique strengths generate attractive returns and I expect our targeted technology developments and electrification, automation and digital solutions to further increase these advantages. Second, our unique value proposition aligns Halliburton with our customers to deliver leading results and maximize asset values. We see the value of this alignment demonstrated again and again in the deepening of our customer strategic alliances. Lastly, I see customer activity shifting towards drilling technology, unconventionals, well intervention and artificial lift, all of which are areas where Halliburton excels today and where we are uniquely positioned to outperform in the future. Turning to our results. I'll begin with the international markets where Halliburton delivered another year of profitable growth. Our full year international revenue grew 6% year-over-year, led by the Middle East/Asia region, which grew 8%. I am pleased with our performance and the growth of our international business. In 2025, we expect flat international revenues for Halliburton year-over-year with growth in most international markets offset by activity reduction in Mexico. Absent Mexico, we expect our international franchise will grow low to mid-single digits next year. Beyond 2025, I am confident in the long-term outlook for Halliburton, in particular the next five years based on the growth engines in our international business and the power of our customer alliances. These growth engines include Halliburton's drilling technologies, unconventionals, well intervention and artificial lift businesses. I believe these growth engines could collectively generate an additional $2.5 billion to $3 billion of annual revenue in three to five years. Even more exciting than the growth I see in these areas, is the trend I see of customers embracing our value proposition to work in increasingly more collaborative and innovative ways. They adopt this way of working because it has proven to consistently improve performance and create value for them. While the power of our collaborative value proposition has traction all around the world, it's most visible in Norway. Halliburton has a growing and profitable business in Norway built on strong customer alliances. These alliances apply leading technologies and collaborative work environments. Together with our customers, we have successfully pioneered several advances that have delivered significant improvements in performance and safety. Over time, I see the rest of our international business moving in the same direction. What is clear to me and equally so to a growing group of operators is that the future of performance lies in deep collaboration. For the last decade, we have made strategic choices in the development of our people, processes and technology to reinforce a culture that is highly collaborative and creates exceptional performance in these environments. I expect this change will create unique value for Halliburton and our customers. To summarize international markets, I expect our value proposition, driving deep collaboration will further differentiate us and create clear value for both Halliburton and our customers. And our growth engines will contribute meaningfully to our international business in the years to come. I'm excited about these opportunities and I believe Halliburton has a terrific platform to outperform the international services market in 2025 and beyond. In North America, our full year revenue of $9.6 billion was an 8% decrease from 2023. Fourth quarter 2024 revenues were 7% lower than third quarter 2024 due to seasonality and customer budget exhaustion. As we look to 2025, I expect our North America revenue to decrease low to mid-single digits from 2024 levels or approximately flat with the second half of 2024. This lower revenue for the year is driven in part by lower negotiated prices for a portion of our fleet and we expect to see the majority of the margin impact from these price revisions in our first quarter results. Despite pricing, I am confident our financial performance will widely outpace our competition. If I step back from the numbers for a minute, I'm excited about several things Halliburton is doing in North America this year. Let me tell you what's going on under the hood that has me so excited. First, we are sold out. All of our fleets are working under committed or contracted programs. Next, Zeus. We're extending and renewing contracts for existing fleets, making new Zeus deliveries and expect our market leading e-fleets will comprise 50% of our fleet by the end of 2025. Next, technology, Octiv Auto Frac and Sensori are being widely adopted by customers and delivering value. Next, directional drilling, iCruise rotary steerables are on a pace to capture about 30% of the North America rotary steerable business by year end. And finally, I believe the next catalyzing inflection for North America services will be up, not down. I believe the most pressing energy problem in North America today is the power shortage driven by electrification and power demand for AI. And this cannot be solved without significant amounts of natural gas. This is on top of the expected increases in LNG exports. These are all very good things for Halliburton in 2025. These are the bedrock of our North America franchise as we move into the second half of the decade. When I think about the North America market through this period, several themes are crystal clear to me. First, our customers rely on our technology, innovation and collaborative work processes to deliver leading performance and lower total well costs. I expect further adoption of these technologies as our customers fully integrate them into their workflows where they drive stable long-term work programs for Halliburton. Octiv Auto Frac is a great example of this. Launched last year, it is already used on over 50% of our Zeus spreads with more growth expected this quarter. Our Sensori fracture monitoring is another example. Customers are adopting this technology at scale to optimize well completion designs on multi-well pads. In the fourth quarter alone, Sensori was used on more than 2,500 Frac stages in North America. The second trend I expect to continue is the rising importance of North America and our large customers' development plans and budgets. I expect our large customers will continue the industrialization of unconventional resources and seek even greater efficiencies and productivity. I believe Halliburton is uniquely positioned to innovate and deliver these improvements at scale. A final trend I expect to see through the rest of the decade is the durability and strength of Halliburton's financial performance. I believe there is little doubt, that our margins and cash flow generation to-date have marked a step change from prior cycles. While markets and margins will fluctuate, I am confident Halliburton's strategy will deliver attractive financial results over the long-term. Let me close my remarks with this. I'm excited about both the year ahead and the long-term for Halliburton. We expect to execute our value proposition, deepen our technology portfolio and deliver incremental revenue through our growth engines, drilling technology, unconventionals, well intervention and artificial lift. Finally, we remain disciplined in our capital allocation, prioritizing cash flow and return of free cash flow to shareholders. In 2024, we returned $1.6 billion or about 60% of free cash flow to shareholders in stock repurchases and dividends, and I expect we will return at least $1.6 billion of cash in 2025. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?
Eric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q4 reported net income per diluted share was $0.70. Total company revenue for Q4 '24 was $5.6 billion, a decrease of 2% sequentially. Operating income was $932 million and operating margin was 17%. Now turning to the segment's results. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q4 was $3.2 billion, a decrease of 4% sequentially. Operating income was $629 million, a decrease of 6% sequentially. Operating margin was 20%, a sequential decrease of 49 basis points. Revenues were primarily driven by lower stimulation activity in North America and decreased pressure pumping services in Latin America, partially offsetting these decreases were improved artificial lift activity in North America and increased stimulation activity in Africa and the Middle East. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q4 was $2.4 billion and operating income was $401 million, both flat sequentially. Operating margin was 16%, a sequential decrease of 44 basis points. Revenues were driven by increased fluid services in the Middle East and Europe/Africa and improved drilling related services in the North Sea, offset by decreased drilling services in the Middle East and Latin America. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q4 international revenue increased 3% sequentially. Latin America revenue in Q4 was $953 million, a decrease of 9% sequentially. This decrease was primarily due to lower activity across multiple product lines in Mexico, partially offsetting these decreases were higher activity across multiple product lines in Brazil. Europe/Africa revenue in Q4 was $795 million, an increase of 10% sequentially. This increase was primarily due to improved drilling related services in the North Sea, as well as increased pressure pumping services and higher fluid services in Africa. Partially offsetting these increases were lower cementing activity and decreased pipeline services in the North Sea. Middle East/Asia revenue in Q4 was $1.6 billion, an increase of 7% sequentially. This increase was primarily due to higher stimulation activity, fluid services and completion tool sales in the Middle East, partially offset by decreased drilling throughout Asia. In North America, Q4 revenue was $2.2 billion, a decrease of 7% sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by lower stimulation activity across the region, partially offset by higher artificial lift activity and increased completion tool sales. Moving on to other items. In Q4, our corporate and other expense was $65 million. We expect our first quarter 2025 corporate expenses to decrease slightly. In Q4, we spent $33 million or about $0.04 per diluted share on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For Q1 2025, we expect SAP expenses to be about $25 million. For the full year '25, we expect SAP expenses to be approximately $100 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $84 million. For Q1 2025, we expect net interest expense to be about $90 million. Other net expense for Q4 was $47 million, which was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange movements in multiple currencies. For Q1 2025, we expect this expense to be approximately $40 million. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 22.6% and we expect our Q1 2025 effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. For the full year 2025, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25.5%, an increase of 300 basis points over our 2024 effective tax rate. This increase is driven in equal parts by fewer anticipated discrete tax items, the implementation of Pillar Two taxes and the shift in geographic earnings mix. Importantly, I expect full year cash taxes to be approximately flat with 2024. Capital expenditure for Q4 were $426 million, which brought our full year CapEx total to $1.4 billion or about 6% of revenue. For the full year of 2025, we expect capital expenditures to remain approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q4 cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion, driven by exceptionally strong collections during the quarter. Our free cash flow in Q4 was $1.1 billion, bringing our full year free cash flow to $2.6 billion, a 16% increase over 2023. Now let me provide you with comments on our expectations for our divisions for Q1 2025. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to decline 3% to 5% and margins to decline 175 basis points to 225 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to decline 8% to 10% and margins to be flat to down 50 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. Here are the key points I would like you to take away from our discussion today. I am confident in the long-term outlook for oil and gas, and I am pleased with the shift towards a pragmatic development of hydrocarbon resources. In the international markets, we see long-term growth as a result of the broader adoption of our collaborative value proposition and our growth engines. In North America, we are sold out on our Frac capacity. We see strong adoption of both our Completions and Drilling technologies and I am confident our financial performance will widely outpace our competition. Finally, we had a strong year for cash returns to shareholders and expect to return at least $1.6 billion to shareholders in 2025. And now let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. You may proceed.
David Anderson: Hi. Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Dave.
David Anderson: So this past year, you had North America revenue fell 8%, a bit worse than you expected, yet C&P margins held pretty flat compared to 2023. On pricing, I guess, can you maybe talk about a little bit kind of how you did that? Was it pricing, more resilient cost structure? Then secondarily, just talked about lower negotiated prices and we see C&P margins coming down this year. So what changed here? Can you talk about kind of what part of your fleet was renegotiated? Was it the Zeus pumps? Was it kind of something or was it certain customers? If you could provide a little color around that, please?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Thanks, David. Look, 2025 -- 2024, yeah, we were able to manage through a market that has been following actually for 18 months in 2024. And in 2025, we expect our outlook is down slightly. Yeah. I think it was the ability to introduce Zeus, it was our efficiencies. It was our -- where we create value in the marketplace. But to be clear, we're not immune to pricing. And so, as we think about that, as I look at '25, all of our fleets are contracted, which is a terrific place to be, number one. We've got great visibility. And there's no question we're at the high end of the range. We know we're at the high end of any range. But we really don't operate in a vacuum looking forward and so our plan is to stick with the strategy. The strategy didn't change in '23, '24 or '25. And I think what you're going to see are solid returns from our business in '25.
David Anderson: So one of the things, a big topic out there is completion efficiencies around the E&Ps. It's continued to be kind of a story out there. And I think that topic for a lot of investors means it's deflationary to services, basically being able to do more with less. On the other hand, how about you're enabling a lot of these efficiencies through your Zeus pumps through Auto Frac. The question is, kind of, how do you get paid for these efficiencies? And is it enough to offset some of these deflationary trends? And if you could please just touch on the recent announcement you had with Coterra on Auto Frac and would you expect more of those agreements to be announced this coming year?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, David. I mean, clearly our -- the efficiency, we want to be at the leading edge of that efficiency. In some ways, I would argue the opposite with you in the sense that what we are doing is at the leading edge and creating outsized value for us. So it clearly offsets the stability of pricing in '24 and quite frankly, the very muted impact of pricing in 2025 relative to what I expect the market is, is on the basis of driving that efficiency and creating more evolutions for Halliburton and the ability to create more value. And quite frankly, it requires investment in equipment and technology to achieve that. And so, look I'm pleased with where we are. And when I look at the market, things like the Coterra announcement are a great example of what that technology does. I mean that's precisely the type of performance and value that we're creating not only in efficiency, but ultimately pointed towards recovery. I mean, and I think that's when I think about our technology and where we sit in the marketplace, we're able to have a very different conversation with customers. Clearly, efficiency is part of that, but there's also a more important dialog to have around the answer products that we're able to achieve with our technology. And answer products are not typically something people talk about with respect to Frac equipment. And so this is not just Frac equipment, it is in fact a platform delivering real answers. And so -- and that's what gives me confidence as I even look ahead into 2025, I think that C&P looks a little bit softer than 2024, but I also expect margin in the second half to firm up relative to the first half. As we see the full impact of getting back to work and then more broadly, tool sales stabilize and then we see growth in interventions and other things. So look, I'm really confident in the business that we have and that the -- this technology is driving a differential outcome for Halliburton.
David Anderson: Great. Thank you very much, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.
Roger Read: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to follow-up, Jeff, if you can on your comments about more U.S. gas needed and how we should think about how Halliburton is positioned for that? Meaning, as Dave was asking about productivity and efficiency trends have been impressive, but a lot of it's also been above ground, not just below ground. So as we ultimately have to increase activity in gas areas, how do you think that works through for you and for the industry?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think it tightens it meaningfully and quickly. I mean, I think from a availability of equipment, this market is always shrinking in effect to what's required or demanded at a point in time. And we've seen attrition, we talked even at Halliburton about how we have retired equipment rather than work-in the spot market, but that's broadly across the industry. And so I think you'll see a lot of tightness in Frac, for example, as we see gas activity pick up.
Roger Read: And one of the -- probably also getting kind of at the question Dave was asking about making sure you get things priced properly, you get the right returns for your company and for shareholders. What's the right way for us to think about where pricing is today versus what you would consider more equitable or even theoretically advantaged situation for Halliburton? Just obviously, you've got pricing pressure now that's worked into the system. It's worked into expectations. But when things start to reverse, kind of where you -- maybe another way to ask a question, where do you think margins can go?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Look, I think margins can move up and I expect that what we had been seeing, I've always thought that in the right kind of market and that pricing would move up well above where we were even in 2024. And so, I don't think it takes a lot of tightness to see that. And when I think about the catalysts of North America, I think that we are more likely to move up than down. And so, the combination of gas activity and we don't talk enough about, but private operators getting back into the business is assets are divested. I'm quite aware of several groups that have raised money that are in the market looking for assets and that's going to drive activity as well. And so, as you described it, we're at a place in the cycle where, yes, we are not immune to pricing, but the reality is, we haven't changed our strategy around that and we expect that we create outsized value and expect to get paid for that.
Roger Read: All right. I appreciate it. I’ll turn it back. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Saurabh Pant with Bank of America. You may proceed.
Saurabh Pant: Hi. Good morning, Jeff, Eric.
Jeff Miller: Good morning.
Eric Carre: Good morning.
Saurabh Pant: Hey, Jeff. Maybe I want to touch on the four growth engines that you talked about on your call, drilling tech, unconventionals, intervention and then artificial lift. It's really interesting, I think, Jeff, correct me, if I'm wrong, but I think I heard you talking about $2.5 billion to $3 billion in additional revenue over the next, I think you said three to five years. Maybe talk to that a little bit and give us a little more color on which of those four growth engines you see the most opportunity and which ones you think are going to be the most powerful over the next couple of years?
Jeff Miller: Well, I think all four of them are going to have meaningful impact. Let's start with unconventionals just internationally. We're a global leader today and we see that market growing. And we also see demand for the technology that we talked about in North America. That same demand for technology and better recovery is universal and so that's certainly not limited to the U.S. I'd also talk about intervention. And again, this is an area where we've developed technology. We continue to develop technology that is differentiated. For example, we talked about riserless coil last quarter, but there's a whole suite of power mechanical tools, our overall focus on execution. And we think that's just a market where we'll see more dollars spent and we'll probably see more of that in sooner rather than later. And then, lift in some ways just given our relative size internationally, we've seen growth, but we've got a lot more upside for Halliburton uniquely as we grow that business and really take the same leadership technology that we see in North America internationally. And so -- and then drilling technology, there's a lot that we're doing around our drilling offering, whether it's closed loop drilling and automation and that's really where we see outsized growth for Halliburton. And so again, I think there's real value to be created there and I think they're all right in our wheelhouse to go do. We're well positioned and have a great suite of technology.
Saurabh Pant: Great. Now, that's a very helpful context, Jeff. And then maybe one -- a question on Mexico. Jeff, Eric, if I understood your guidance right, I think you said excluding Mexico, international, you expect to be up low to mid-single digit, right? And including Mexico, it's flat. If I'm doing the math right, I know I don't have all the numbers, right. But if I'm doing the rough math right, that implies Mexico maybe it's down like 25% year-over-year. First thing, can you maybe validate that kind of math? And then what's exactly the expectation for Mexico through 2025? Do you expect things to improve in the back half of the year or do we not have any visibility there?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think that what we see in Mexico is a new administration, new management team for Pemex and a bit of an activity reset. I say all of that and that is our outlook today, but at the same time, oil and gas is hypercritical to the economy in Mexico. And so it's hard for me to imagine that they don't find their footing as we work through the year. And we have a fantastic market position in Mexico. One of the reasons it's important to us and we have a great team there. And so I'm quite confident Halliburton will execute well in that market. But I think it's more a question around timing in terms of as Pemex finds its footing. And that's certainly not clear today, but I expect that it happens. It has in the past and I expect it will again.
Saurabh Pant: Okay. Perfect. I got that. Okay, Jeff, I'll turn it back. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Eric Carre: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with J.P. Morgan Securities. You may proceed.
Arun Jayaram: Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. I have a follow-up maybe to David's question. Could you give us a sense -- we understand in talking to E&Ps that the Octiv Auto Frac service can be deployed with different kind of configurations. So I was wondering maybe you could briefly describe how it works and if you do pair it with the Sensori Frac monitoring service, the different configurations and maybe just talk a little bit about the commercial model if you do it on a standalone basis again versus combining it with Sensori, because I think you mentioned it's now running on 50% of your e-fleets.
Eric Carre: Yeah. Look, I'm -- effectively, it gives you perfect control over the fracking so that this is Octiv Auto Frac. And so the result is that the frac fleet is programmed to deliver, what is designed and because of the ability to control the horsepower, it can deliver what is designed. And so I think that is something that's never been done before in terms of having the confidence that precisely what is designed is in fact what is delivered. And then Sensori, in effect is the ability to verify where the sand is going at its core. And again, that's an answer product we've never had in hydraulic fracturing since its inception. As where did the sand go? I think of it not too different from an MWD log-in some ways. You wouldn't drill a well without an MWD log of where the well -- where the bit went, where the wellbore is. And quite frankly, why would you not want to know and how is that not part of the solution? Where did the sand go since that's the only really active ingredient in creating production. And so I think we have -- together you've created sort of the design, the delivery, the control and the verification around where did the sand go in the wellbore. And because of that, now when you can change design, that the change design actually got delivered as well. I think this is something we've never been able to know or control in the Frac business before. I hope that's helpful.
Arun Jayaram: Yeah. And just maybe the commercial model on how you're pricing this kind of service?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. It's priced for sure. I'm not going to get into the details here, but it's -- yes, it's a -- look, it's a valuable solution. It is, yes, standalone separate from the Frac service delivery and that's really all I'm going to say about that.
Arun Jayaram: Fair enough. Jeff, my follow-up, I was wondering if you could give us some thoughts on what you're seeing offshore. I believe about 50% of your international business is tied to offshore markets. Obviously, some white space concerns in second half of the year. But any thoughts on how offshore revenues could trend industry wide in 2025 and how is -- how revenue would fare offshore in 2025?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Look, I will have a -- we have a strong business offshore as you described, and I think that from our perspective, we don't see white space. What we see are rigs that move from market-to-market, which is not too unusual. We see quite a few FIDs sort of in the hopper as we get into, well, early '25 and then even activity beginning even more so later in '25 into '26 and '27. So, solid pipeline of growth internationally. And part of that international growth that we see obviously will be tied to offshore. And so, look, I think we'll fare well. I think that's going to be an important component of our international growth, save Mexico. And so I wouldn't over worry about the white space because that sort of occurs all the time I think.
Arun Jayaram: All right. Thanks a lot, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. You may proceed.
Kurt Hallead: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the time here this morning. Got a question related to some of the dynamics at play. With respect to the opportunity related to the power generation sale of power in the Permian Basin, cut to the chase, right. You had one of your smaller competitors basically go out and buy some megawatts to sell power in the Permian. Is that something that's on your radar screen, Jeff? And if not specifically on your radar screen, how do you think that plays out and is there an opportunity for Halliburton to participate?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Certainly, it's on my radar screen and we are in that business today, with VoltaGrid and we have a front row seat. And so the exposure to that market through our participation investment in VoltaGrid is solid and we like the business a lot and fortunately, through VoltaGrid and sort of what we do, we are getting a view of this with what I would describe as a real player in that market, which is VoltaGrid. And so look, that's -- stay tuned, but that's an area that is attractive to us and very consistent with our core competencies at Halliburton. And we think we're aligned with and invested in far and away the largest player in that business today.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. That's great. Appreciate that color. Now the follow-up as well, you referenced that you see an opportunity for Halliburton to generate an incremental, would you say, $2.5 billion to maybe $3 billion of revenue over the next couple of years predicated on three specific areas of focus. Can you just give us a sense as to, is that going to be with new products and technologies already in place? And then, with the adaptation or adoption of that, or is it going to be continued incremental evolution of those technologies over time or some combination of both? Just looking for a little bit of incremental color on how you see that evolving?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Fair enough. And I see that as a continued drumbeat of technology development and introduction along with we do bolt-on type M&A and we're doing that all of the time, but more targeted at these areas to create technology and integration of technology that I believe will be unique and continue to be unique in these spaces. And so it's -- we've talked about a few of them, we'll continue to talk about technology deliveries in this space. And we've been working at sort of the technology development for a few years. And so, I think we're set up with sort of waves of technology over the next two to three years that will give us better opportunity to outgrow the market. They are businesses that we are in today, but I think we have a -- we're positioned both technically and from a value proposition standpoint to deliver outsized growth.
Kurt Hallead: Great. Always appreciate the color, Jeff. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Becker with Capital One. You may proceed.
Douglas Becker: Thank you. The first quarter revenue declined a little bit sharper than we've seen recently. Just want to get a little more color on which regions you see driving that decline. Granted, some of those are obvious and just how you see the revenue progression the rest of the year? It sounds like it will be a more gradual recovery over the course of the year rather than a sharp 2Q bump.
Jeff Miller: Yeah, Doug. So the main drivers behind the reduction in revenue for Q1, I'll take it by division. It's probably clear if you look at it that way from a trend perspective. On the C&P side, it's primarily the roll-off of very strong completion tool sales, excuse me, in Q4, that's partially offset by pickup of activity in North America and then you have some seasonal mix around the world. So that's on the C&P side. On the D&E side, the biggest impact is coming from Mexico, which we discussed earlier. And then we had a particularly strong Q4 in D&E on the back of direct sales items of products. Some of it was in the Middle East, but in other regions as well. So these are the main drivers behind the revenue change Q1 over Q4.
Douglas Becker: Thank you. And maybe another one for you, Eric. Just wanted to get a little more color on the D&E operating margin outlook. Last year up just a hair, had very strong margin improvement in 2023. You've had some product introductions that seem to be getting good traction. Is it reasonable to expect some margin improvement this year in the D&E segment versus last year?
Eric Carre: Yeah. I mean the -- I think the way we're looking at the D&E margins for the year is basically fairly flat. So think about D&E margins in 2025 as being in the relative same zip code as we had in 2024 overall. That's how we're looking at it now.
Douglas Becker: That makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. You may proceed.
Stephen Gengaro: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Two from me. The one, and I know Kurt brought up the power generation question, but I had a question around the cost of power to the frac fleets. And I know your alignment with VoltaGrid, but is there any concern around the power gen being pulled out-of-the oil patch in any large ways and then increasing kind of the underlying price for power-to-power e-fleets and how that kind of impacts the business?
Jeff Miller: Well, we've consciously stayed away from owning that power for our own fleets, partly because we do believe that's an arm’s length transaction that may or may not fluctuate, but I think that operators will own that part of the business in terms of the contracting from an availability standpoint, we're in a very good place with our current contracting and relationship with VoltaGrid. So I feel quite confident in the availability of power to us through that mechanism. And so, no, I'm not particularly concerned about the power availability nor really the price of power. I think that the power is valuable and I think that the value created by the entire package is outsized. So as a result, I think we're in a good place strategically how we've gone about power as Halliburton. And I think from a market standpoint, if there is tightness in power, I think we will be protected from that based on really decisions we made early on about how we would align around power.
Stephen Gengaro: Great. Thanks. And my follow-up, we've heard from the folks over at Kimberlite Research that the sort of preference for Frac fleets going forward is skewed towards dual fuel over electric with kind of this maybe, 20%, 25% of the respondents sort of talking about electric as sort of the go-to, which is sort of different than your mix. And I'm curious what you're hearing from customers and this is probably related to sort of your customer mix versus others. But I'm curious what you're seeing from customers as far as preference for dual fuel versus electric and how that kind of aligns with your mix of assets?
Jeff Miller: Look, we have continued deliveries for 2025. We have deliveries. I suspect we'll be planning deliveries for 2026 and we're extending the fleets that we have. So -- and so I am quite confident in sort of the demand set for our solution and it's really the platform as much as obviously the substitution is important for dual fuel fleet from a cost perspective and then the increased value creation that we see with Auto Frac and Sensori, they really are becoming more and more important.
Stephen Gengaro: Great. Thanks for the color.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call-back over to Jeff Miller for any closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Thank you, Josh. As we close the call today, let me wrap up with this. I'm excited about both the year ahead and the long-term for Halliburton. We expect to execute our value proposition, deepen our leading and differentiated technology portfolio and deliver incremental revenue through our growth engines. I'm committed to prioritizing cash flow and I expect all of this results in a return of at least $1.6 billion of cash in 2025. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-11-07 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2024 Halliburton Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I will pass the call over to the Senior Director of Investor Relations, David Coleman. Please go ahead.
David Coleman: Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton third quarter 2024 conference call. We will make a recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today's discussion with our highlights from the third quarter. We delivered total company revenue of $5.7 billion and adjusted operating margin of 17%. International revenue was $3.3 billion and grew by 4% year-over-year, led by Middle East Asia, which delivered an increase of 9%. North America revenue was $2.4 billion, a decrease of 9% year-over-year. Finally, during the third quarter, we generated $841 million of cash flow from operations, $543 million of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $200 million of our common stock. The August cybersecurity event has not had a material effect on our financial condition or operating results. However, that event, together with the effect of storms in the Gulf of Mexico, did reduce our adjusted earnings for the quarter by roughly $0.02 per share due to lost or delayed revenue. The cybersecurity event also had an impact on our free cash flow during the quarter due to delayed billing and collections and caused us to pause our share repurchase program while we assess the impact of the event. Importantly, our full year expectations for free cash flow and cash returned to shareholders remain unchanged, and we expect both to accelerate in the fourth quarter. Before we move on, I would like to take a moment and thank our employees for their extraordinary work while we navigated the cybersecurity event this quarter. Our employees maintained operational continuity under challenging conditions, and I celebrate their effort and grit as they work through the event. I would also like to extend my thanks and appreciation to our customers for their support and close collaboration through this time. Turning to our geographic results. I'll begin with the international markets where Halliburton's revenue grew 4% year-over-year, led by the Middle East Asia region. For the full year, I expect international revenue growth to be in line with the overall market and below our prior guidance. I am pleased with our performance and the continued growth of our business. Next year, directionally, we see international growth in the low- to mid-single digits. I'm encouraged by projects I see in the pipeline, and I am confident that Halliburton will deliver on these opportunities and create value for both us and our customers. My confidence comes from the strength of our largest international business lines, the depth of our technology portfolio, the breadth of our global reach and the power of our value proposition. Halliburton's largest international business lines, cementing, completion tools and drilling fluids form the backbone of oil and gas development spending globally and each is a leader in their market. We've earned these leadership positions through our legacy of execution, consistent service quality and our digital and technology developments. The transformation of our Sperry Drilling business clearly demonstrates the impact technology developments have on our business. The success of our organically developed iCruise and iStar directional drilling and logging tools, LOGIX automation and remote operation platform and ultra-deep resistivity and look ahead tools create a step change in Halliburton's international competitiveness and return profile. Year-to-date, Sperry has delivered the highest international revenue growth of any major product line. Further, Halliburton today is present in all major international basins as well as select frontier areas with promising future development potential. Our international business operates both on and offshore with roughly 50% of our revenue outside of North America land earned from offshore operations. Finally, our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers drives our unique approach to creating value for our customers and Halliburton. Our collaborative approach wins with our customers and is exemplified by our alliances in the North Sea and elsewhere. These alliances have pioneered new ways of working to consistently deliver industry-leading performance on integrated projects. I am confident in our international business. I am confident because of the strength of our technology portfolio, our unique value proposition, our clear strategy, our experienced workforce and deep customer relationships. I expect that Halliburton's international franchise will continue to deliver growth and returns. Today, I would like to spend some time describing a few areas where I expect outsized international growth for Halliburton in 2025 and beyond. These are unconventionals, artificial lift and intervention. Two things are clear to me. One, unconventional developments are becoming more important, and I expect they will grow faster than other market segments over the next few years. Two, Halliburton is the clear leader in unconventionals, both in technology and execution, and I expect Halliburton to play the same leadership role internationally as we have in the U.S. We see evidence of this in the Middle East, where Halliburton was awarded a multiyear unconventional drilling services contract and started up an unconventional hydraulic fracturing fleet, both of which grow Halliburton's market share in a strategically important customer asset. Elsewhere in the region, we see several other growth opportunities for Halliburton in emerging unconventional plays. Turning to Halliburton's international artificial lift business, we saw over 30% year-on-year revenue growth this quarter, and we expect to continue to outgrow the market on the strength of our leading technology portfolio. One such technology is our TrueSync hybrid motor, which combines the reliability of an induction motor with the efficiency of a permanent magnet motor. Initially deployed in North America, we anticipate strong international demand, especially in Latin America and the Middle East, where its economic benefits can be realized at scale. Another key technology is our Intelevate service, which uses AI to process real-time data and remotely manage pumps for optimal performance. We saw a 50% increase in international wells monitored since the start of the year. In North America, Halliburton performed over 160,000 remote interventions this year, and we expect Intelevate to deliver similar value internationally as we expand our installed ESP base. Well intervention is another segment, I believe, will outgrow the overall market. We have seen this already with our Production Solutions product line, which this year alone has grown at twice the rate of our overall international business. Well intervention has long been an area of focus for Halliburton's organic investment and technology development. For example, Halliburton and alliance with TechnipFMC achieved the world's first riserless coiled tubing intervention service. This technology means Halliburton's full suite of subsea well intervention services can be deployed without the requirement for a riser equipped deepwater rig. Customers can now intervene in thousands of marginal or end-of-life offshore wells that otherwise could not be economically serviced. These are a few examples that describe the unique above-market growth opportunities we see for Halliburton. To summarize international markets, I am confident in the strength of our international business. I believe our technology portfolio, value proposition, and strategy will drive profitable growth in 2025. Turning to North America. Our third quarter revenue declined 4% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to lower hydraulic fracturing activity in U.S. land. I expect the combination of seasonality and budget exhaustion will result in a full year revenue decline at the low end of our prior guidance. Our strategy to maximize value in North America remains unchanged, and I expect we will continue to outperform our competitors. Here's how I expect to maximize value in North America as I look to 2025. In our Completion business, maximizing value means unique technology leading service quality and efficiencies and disciplined capital deployment. The success of this strategy is clear. And today, I am pleased that 90% of our fracturing fleets are committed for work in 2025, with multiple opportunities for the remaining 10%. Further, the unique completion technologies we deploy in this market are key differentiators for Halliburton and our customers. Together, they comprise the Zeus platform, electric pumping units, Octiv Auto Frac and Sensori subsurface measurement. Each of these technologies is commercial, and we are seeing accelerated adoption into customer workflows. This quarter, we signed contracts for two new e-fleets and also secured extensions on several existing fleets at prices commensurate with the leading performance of our platform. We believe the performance of our e-fleets and their integration with other unique components of the Zeus platform will continue to drive demand for this equipment, which we expect exceeds 50% of our active fleet next year. Turning to Octiv Auto Frac. Customers have contracted this automation technology at a remarkable pace. Since launch in Q3, we've deployed Auto Frac on 20% of our e-fleets and expect to expand to 50% in the next two months. In 2025, we expect the vast majority of our e-fleets to operate with Auto Frac contracts. I am also pleased with the deployment progress of Sensori fracture diagnostics, which provide the building blocks for improved per foot recovery for our customers. During the third quarter, we embedded Halliburton's Sensori fracture monitoring technology into a number of our customers' well completion workflows and expect to further expand our customer base for this unique technology in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, I expect the Zeus' platform and its constituent technologies to see continued adoption. I believe these technologies, working together seamlessly in an automated real-time environment will create a path to greater fracture consistency, ever higher levels of efficiency and ultimately improved recovery. The potential value creation related to these technologies is significant. We are working today with several market-leading operators to advance this integrated application of the Zeus platform. I believe we are just at the beginning of what this technology will accomplish. Shifting to Drilling and Evaluation. Our North America drilling services business demonstrated nearly 20% year-on-year growth this quarter despite a rig count decline of 5% over the same period. I expect this unique growth to continue in 2025. In unconventional basins, our iCruise rotary steerable tool and LOGIX drilling automation platform, reliably deliver curve and lateral sections in a single run. We delivered revenue growth this year in each of our commercial models. Rental, sales and full service, and I expect further expansion next year. In Canada, Halliburton's leading portfolio of well ranging technologies, such as our Aurora magnetic ranging service, is the preferred solution for steam-assisted gravity drainage wells. Expanded midstream infrastructure has improved market access for oil producers in Canada, which creates a strong future runway for these technologies. In Alaska, our EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity tool and reservoir mapping service deliver unmatched performance and unique insights for customers drilling extended reach wells on the North Slope. We see significant growth opportunities for our logging while drilling and directional drilling services as activity increases in multiple projects in the area over the next few years. Across a broad spectrum of North America drilling applications, Halliburton's technology delivers performance, precision and unique insights for our customers that have driven meaningful share growth and strong returns, and I expect further revenue growth in 2025. To finish my thoughts on North America. Our strategy to maximize value is unchanged. The strategy means we focus on returns, not share. We deliver leading service quality and efficiency, and we develop differentiated technologies that create value for our customers and Halliburton. I believe Halliburton's execution of this strategy has transformed the resilience and profitability of our North America business. Let me close with this. I see solid opportunities across business lines and geographies for Halliburton. As we execute on our strategies, profitable international growth and maximize value in North America, we will target opportunities to deliver unique value, allocate capital to the highest return opportunities, and prioritize free cash flow generation and shareholder returns. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?
Eric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q3 reported net income per diluted share was $0.65. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.73. Before we turn to our detailed results, I want to take a moment to discuss the impacts of the cybersecurity event this quarter on our earnings, free cash flow, stock buybacks and SAP deployment. Starting with earnings, the lost revenue resulting from the cybersecurity event and the storms in the Gulf of Mexico impacted our adjusted results by approximately $0.02 per diluted share. In addition, we incurred $35 million of cybersecurity event related expenses, which is excluded from our adjusted results. In Q4, we do not expect to incur significant further expenses related to the event. Our free cash flow was impacted by system outages, which affected our ability to invoice and collect receivables during the quarter. We work closely with our customers and expect to collect those amounts in Q4. We maintain our expectation of greater than 10% growth in full year free cash flow compared to last year. We paused our stock repurchase program as we assess the impact of the event and repurchased fewer shares this quarter than targeted. Our plan is to catch up on buybacks in Q4. Finally, this quarter, we successfully completed the implementation of SAP S4 in our first country. Based on lessons learned there, and the cybersecurity event, I now expect the project to be delayed three to six months and cost approximately $20 million to $30 million more than our initial estimate. Turning now to our company results. Total company revenue for Q3 '24 was $5.7 billion, a decrease of 2% sequentially. Adjusted operating income was $987 million, and adjusted operating margin was 17%. Now turning to the segment results. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q3 was $3.3 billion, a decrease of 3% sequentially. Operating income was $669 million, a decrease of 7% sequentially and operating income margin was 20%. These results were driven by lower hydraulic fracturing services in U.S. land and Latin America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q3 was $2.4 billion, while operating income was $406 million, both sequentially flat. Operating margin was 17%, a sequential increase of 36 basis points. These results were driven by improvement in fluid activity in Latin America and higher software sales globally, offset by greater-than-anticipated rig count reductions in the Middle East and project delays in the North Sea, two of our largest well construction markets. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q3 international revenue was flat sequentially. Europe Africa revenue in Q3 was $722 million, a decrease of 5% sequentially. This decline was primarily due to decreased drilling-related services in the North Sea, and lower completion tool sales in West Africa. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher cementing activity in the North Sea. Middle East Asia revenue in Q3 was $1.5 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially. This increase was primarily due to increased pressure pumping services in Saudi Arabia, higher completion tool sales and fluid services in the Middle East, and higher wireline activity in Asia. Partially offsetting these improvements were lower drilling services and project management activity in the Middle East. Latin America revenue in Q3 was $1.1 billion, a 4% decrease sequentially. This decrease was primarily due to lower hydraulic fracturing activity in Argentina, partially offset by increased drilling-related services and improved project management activity in the region. In North America, Q3 revenue was $2.4 billion, a 4% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in U.S. land in addition to lower activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico, partly due to the impact of storms. Moving on to other items. In Q3, our corporate and other expense was $60 million, which was below our prior guidance. As a result, we expect our Q4 corporate expenses to increase about $10 million. In Q3, we spent $28 million or about $0.03 per diluted share on SAPS for migration, which is included in our results. For Q4, we expect SAP expenses to increase about $5 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $85 million. For Q4, we expect net interest expense to increase about $5 million. Other net expense for Q3 was $52 million, which was higher than anticipated, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange movements in multiple currencies. For Q4, we expect this expense to be approximately $35 million. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 21%, and our normalized effective tax rate was 23.5%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. Capital expenditures for Q3 were $339 million. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 6.4% of revenue. Our Q3 cash flow from operations was $841 million, and free cash flow was $543 million. For the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow to be at least 10% higher than 2023. Now let me provide you with comments on our expectations for Q4. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to decline 1% to 3% and margins to decline 75 to 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to be flat to up 2% and margins to be flat to up 50 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. Here are the key points I would like you to take away from our discussion today. I am confident in our international business. I believe the strength of our technology portfolio, unique value proposition, and clear strategy will continue to deliver growth and returns. I'm excited about the emerging trends in the international market, where I believe Halliburton will demonstrate unique growth. And in North America, we are widening the moat around our Zeus platform and expect to keep growing our drilling business. And now, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Dave Anderson with Barclays. Please proceed.
Dave Anderson: So maybe let's just start with the obvious, and how you think the election might impact your business? Is the thesis out there, obviously, the market sort of buying first asking questions later? But that reduced regulation, faster permitting is going to result in higher onshore activity kind of going forward. Is that a valid assumption? I mean, is that the way you're thinking about the market for the next couple of years? I could certainly see how complete the Gulf of Mexico, which seems to be mired in red tape. But how do you think this impacts your North America onshore business?
Jeff Miller: Look, Dave, it's only positive. It could only be positive. In fact, I'm quite optimistic about that outlook. And here's why. I mean, I think what you saw was a reflection of a commonsense view of economics and resource development, which are incredibly important in this country. And then more importantly, it's the way it was rolled out. I mean it reflects the majority of people that have a rational view about how important energy is to our country. And so, when I think about that, I think every dollar that is not spent defending and debating the industry, but rather being invested in this industry, are absolutely good for Halliburton's business.
Dave Anderson: What about the Gulf of Mexico? Do you think this could -- you could start to see a pickup in activity out there? I mean I know there's been some issues kind of getting permits and things like that. Do you think that could potentially free that up?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I think -- look, Dave, yes. I mean I think that there's a lot of risk that's been painted over this industry, particularly regulatory risk, and it's probably even more acute in the Gulf of Mexico, given the significance of the investments and the types of decisions that get made that are long term in nature by operators. And I think the more that those are derisked either through regulation or legislation creates an even better runway. I mean operators don't operate in a vacuum. I mean they are digesting risk every day. And I think what we saw was directionally, hey, energy is extremely important. There's absolutely no reason we should be -- anyway, I think that we're in a good place with energy development in this country.
Dave Anderson: Understood. And if I could maybe shift to just more specifically kind of the here and now and U.S. onshore. It's clearly slowing as we approach year-end, we've all sort of seen this. It does look like you faced a ton of pricing pressure so far, but you're kind of guiding down to margins kind of moving down a little bit in the fourth quarter. I was wondering if you could talk about sort of potential widening spread of pricing amongst say conventional diesel, Tier 4 and e-frac. Are you seeing that kind of spread happening here? And if so, does this kind of -- are you thinking about accelerating your Zeus? You talked about this towards Zeus platform, which really does sound very differentiated. I just wanted to accelerate that program because that should, therefore, kind of drive into higher pricing going forward?
Jeff Miller: Well, Dave, we still see demand for our Zeus platform and growing demand for that Zeus platform. So, we'll be consistent with in terms of acceleration is more a matter of customers that see the value and contract them. And we've seen that actually this quarter, and we've seen renewals. So, I feel really confident in that. And I think it will accelerate almost just by virtue of making that available in the market and having more opportunities to put it to work, as opposed to when you think acceleration, that means we push the pedal and spend and do. I really think we're going to stick with our maximize value approach and let the diesel, retire or move outside the country, that will be replaced with electric and also -- as important as the electric is, quite frankly, the entire platform that is creating outsized value for customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities. Please proceed.
Arun Jayaram: Jeff and Eric, I really want to get your thoughts on how you see North America and Completion and Production kind of trending next year? You mentioned that 90% of your frac fleets is committed for '25 and perhaps 50% of that capacity up to that could be Zeus fleets. So, it sounds like you've kind of navigated through the RFP season, and you got a lot of equipment kind of committed. You also mentioned that you've announced some extensions on some Zeus fleet that's maybe a little bit earlier than we're thinking. So, I was just wondering, given that amount of capacity that's been committed, what's your just outlook for non-frac next year? And I'm trying to think about how margins could play out over the next 12 months.
Jeff Miller: Well, look, look, I feel good about 2025, and we talk to customers -- I talk to customers every day, and they are clearly planning to work. But they're also planning to be more efficient and improve recovery at the same time. Now that's plays directly into our strengths, whether it's more silo frac, longer laterals, faster wells and obviously the Zeus platform. So, when I think about 2025, I think about maximizing value, and that means solving the hardest problems are unconventionals with better recovery, widening the moat around our Zeus platform, the drilling performance that I described in the outsized adoption that we're seeing for our drilling solution. And yes, having 90 fleets committed -- 90% of our fleets committed today, does form a view about 2025, and I've described those things that we're going to be doing in the market that are consistent with the performance as you've seen till now. So, I think about the market today. I mean we've arguably been arguably have been in a downturn for 18 months. And the tools and the approach that we've taken are the tools and approach that we will take.
Arun Jayaram: Okay. Fair enough, Jeff. Maybe -- it does help us think about '25. This is kind of a consistent buy side question that we've gotten, Jeff. Is the dynamic in North American frac is the fact that companies like Halliburton are pumping more hours per day doing more completion footage completed per day? And so, a lot of my E&P coverage now is highlighting the ability, for example, one operator mentioned that they could do -- in '25, they could use four frac fleets to do what five frac fleets did in '24. Does that make sense? So, you're using less equipment. And the question we're asking ourselves is how does this impact your profitability if these four frac fleets are doing a similar amount of footage? How does that impact Halliburton, were thinking maybe you lose some margins or some revenues through pass-through, but how does that impact your base frac business using that example?
Jeff Miller: Well, look, number one, we're at the leading edge of that efficiency, which means that we're getting more reps, and in most cases, based on sort of our equipment, we get more reps on less capital. So, from a maximized value standpoint, it doesn't take 2x the equipment to do a simul-frac. In fact, it takes less than half more. And so, generating the same or more revenue with less equipment is positive and strategically why we build the equipment the way that we do. At the same time, creating more value by pumping, which just takes me to the Zeus solution and the platform. That's also part of how the operators get better. And I'll tell you, I would much rather be on the front end of this than somewhere else. So, leading this charge is where we want to be. It keeps us busy and creating opportunities to create more value. So, you're thinking about it the right way. Yes, this industry gets more efficient. I think it gets harder to get more efficient from here. But I expect Halliburton plays at the front end of that and as a leader. So, in some ways, the capital efficiency. I mean, we're driving capital efficiency, which ultimately does support margins. And look, there's a -- we are where we are today. If I look forward into the future, we know how to operate in that environment, and we're doing it, and we're successful at it. But I also think it's unreasonable to ignore future catalysts, whether Tier 1 rock becomes Tier 2, becomes Tier 3. There are other things that happened that I think would be positive.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
James West: You highlighted a lot on intervention this quarter. I think maybe investors that aren't following you as closely as myself or Dave or Arun would know about the tremendous amount of, not capital, but just R&D and work you guys have done in building that business out as a big strength of yours. Could you maybe talk through kind of -- I guess, why highlight now? I guess first and then kind of where you were, where you've been, where you are today, and how you view that as one of the kind of huge strength of the Company?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, James. Look, this has always been an important business for Halliburton intervention, whether it's stimulation, it's entering wellbores, and those are the markets that maintain the baseload of oil and gas production around the world. And so, we've been in that business, but I'm highlighting it partly because I don't anyone to forget how important predicting that base load is, and how much work that generates. But I also would like to characterize that in terms of the R&D effort that we're putting in around that. And so, if I go sort of contextually over look over some history. In Halliburton when we invest in a direction, it's important for us. So, I think unconventionals, if you go back a number of years, then we've talked about what we've done around Sperry drilling from an R&D and creating critical mass and a bigger business doing the same thing with intervention. And we've done it for a number of years. However, you're going to see us developing things like we described on the call today, riserless intervention is an incredible step forward in terms of making wells economic. We've talked about it for a decade probably worked hard on it with a technique FMC for five years, and now we're here. But those are the kind of things I expect to see us do more of and create a bigger growing market for us. And so, from our perspective, this is where we will see outsized growth internationally.
James West: Okay. Very good to hear. And then, Jeff, the growth in the interventions part of the business make earnings a little bit less cyclical than perhaps they've been previously and therefore, a higher multiple.
Jeff Miller: I think so. I mean these are completely agree with you, and it's part of the reason we want to continue to invest and generate that outsized growth. But it's the kind of growth that decline curves never go away. And so, everything is obviously declining. Therefore, there is always demand for intervention as we described.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Roger Read: Jeff, can I get your take, you talk a lot here about the opportunities international. And obviously, everybody talks about the productivity and efficiency that's going on in North America. Could you give us a little bit of a contrast of what you see happening globally? I mean, not just your products and services that improve it. But if you were to just say, what you think your customers are getting right now in terms of productivity and efficiency, how that's affecting your business question asked earlier, I think, by Arun, right, five frac crews goes to four, what the impacts are. So, as you think about the opportunity internationally, how does that compare? What kind of headwinds are you facing on the productivity front there?
Jeff Miller: Well, look, North America fantastic resource, fantastic market and a place where operators can implement technology in a fairly straightforward way. I would say that internationally, we're much further behind in terms of technology application. In fact, I would argue some are just moving into maturity in Argentina where we will start to see more and more. But the Middle East, for example, has worked to a point, but I think that the opportunity -- we'll actually see growth in terms of consumption of equipment well before we see efficiency cresting just because there's so much work to do. And I think what those markets get the benefit of, particularly with Halliburton is a lot of the technology that creates better wells. I mean, if you go back in time in the U.S., they're well designed, there are a lot of wells that we would like to go back and refrac. But today, armed with the technology that we have, I believe we'll make better wells. But to say that -- but to get specifically to your question, we're not even close to that point of efficiency, reducing demand internationally. In fact, we're at the opposite end of that. We're back like it looked in the U.S., early days, where add-add, let's do more. Hope that helps, Roger?
Roger Read: Yes, it does. I'd say kind of what we look at, the evidence seems similar that way, but I just wanted to talk to the experts about it. The other question I had, one of the things we hear about is a way to potentially accelerate drilling speeds going forward in the U.S. might be greater expansion of rotary steerable type and other types of advanced drilling devices. You mentioned that in your introductory part of the call as something to roll out to Latin America. But I was just curious how that's -- how do you see that in North America in terms of additional penetration over the coming years?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. Look, I'm crystal clear that this is a market that continues to grow in rotary steerables, just the efficiency, precision, the types of wells that are being drilled in terms of length, tortuosity, everything I see in North America says, over time, the trend is that rotary steerables are a bigger and bigger part of this market, both from the ability to execute the drilling in terms of the complexity and length, but also the speed in terms of curve lateral. And that's really where we're getting so much traction with our iCruise tools in North America has been the reliability around drilling that curve lateral. And I see the exact same thing internationally. In fact, we're already -- we've described the contract that we've won in the Middle East for Sperry, same type of thing. I would expect to see growth in really any unconventional market around the world that -- iCruise CX is a terrific tool. I mean it's the performance is what's causing the growth in and share. And so very pleased with where we are, but I also think we're in the right spot from a secular growth standpoint, in the sense that, that is directionally where the market has to go in order to continue to get better both in time, but also in terms of the types of wells and the lengths that are being drilled.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Neil Mehta: I had a couple of company-specific items here, which is around the cybersecurity incident what are, Jeff, lessons learned around that certainly something that all Fortune-500 companies are having to contend with. But how do you ensure protection of this going forward? And help us understand it sounds like, it could create some delays to the ERP system rollout. Can you talk a little bit about what those impacts were?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. Look, I think from lessons learned standpoint, I cannot overemphasize the importance of preparedness in terms of desktop drills, contracting with the absolute best professionals in the industry. And I'm so appreciative of the companies have supported us, Mandiant and others. But I would say that is probably one of the most important things any company can do is be absolutely prepared in advance for that.
Eric Carre: So, in terms of the SAP ERP rollout, Neil, there's really a couple of things. So, the first one is what relates directly to the cyber incidents. And there, obviously, once the incident started most of our IT folks went on to helping fix the problem, restore the systems and everything. They were unavailable, obviously, to continue to participate in the rollout. And when that was done and the systems were restored, what you had is the finance and procurement organization when you do a catch-up mode basically restoring in the system or of the transaction that were made when we were operating in a manual mode. The second impact from the incident was the fact that as we roll out a big system like this, we do what's called localization events, which when we go and roll out the system in a new country, we sent a team ahead of time to really understand the details of statutories differences, tax differences and everything so that we get ready for any particular specifics of a given country. And then in parallel to that, we had the rollout in our -- first country we rolled out the system in Canada that was successful. We closed the quarter on S4. We closed October on S4, but as we did all of that, we learned a few things around the structure of our training around what it means to manage processes in two different systems and everything. So, all of that resulted in a replanning of the rollout, which we think now is going to be about three to six months over the initial plan. So, we'll get into H1 2026.
Neil Mehta: Okay. Great. I'm glad you guys navigated. The follow-up is just around the stock buybacks. Again, you did $250 million in March and then $250 million in June in this quarter, it was closer to $200 million, and you explained why. But is 250 the right run rate, all else equal, as we think about 2025 and given the pullback in the share price given the macro environment, is there an argument to really lean into the share repurchase and take it to another level and really drive that free cash flow per share? So, I'll turn it over to you guys on that.
Eric Carre: Yes. So, to address first part of your question, that's what we plan ahead, guided to an average $250 million per quarter that would lead to something around $1 billion for the year, significantly up from 2023. So, what happened in Q3 is, I mean, the mechanism that we use to go and buy back share, we do it in two parallel ways. So, one, we filed a 10b5-1 plan; and two, we do open purchase in the market. So, when the cyber incident started, we basically were cautious and we stopped all the open purchases because we didn't want to end up in a situation where the investigation would lead to the discovery of MDI. So, we paused that continued with the 10b5 plan. So, all of that landed in a number that was below what we were targeted initially and as we said in the remarks, the intent is to catch up a bit on that in Q4. Directionally, on the second part of your question, we really view buybacks as a systematic mechanism to return cash to shareholders. We look at it through cycles. So, while there might be some short-term opportunities, to your point, around the current share prices, we tried not to be opportunistic per se, but view -- again, stock buyback more as a through cycle mechanism to return cash. So, we might weigh in a bit more, but directionally, we want to be fairly steady. And as we look into next year, while we haven't worked our plan through, the general view would be to up what we've done so far in 2024.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Saurabh Pant with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Saurabh Pant: Jeff, maybe I have a couple of questions, one on offshore, one on North America. Let me just start on the offshore side of things because that's one place where there is a lot of optimism and structural optimism, not just short-term optimism. I want to just come back to that I know in the past, you have talked about upside in '25, particularly in West Africa and Norway and obviously offshore in general. But amongst the conversation from the offshore drillers and delay in contracting, maybe some projects being delayed due to the macro supply chain delays, given all of those headlines on the offshore driller side of things, is there anything we should be mindful of for the offshore side of your business as we think about 2025?
Jeff Miller: No. Look, we see stability in our biggest markets, whether the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, Guyana, Norway, Black Sea, as we described this morning, positive elements of those. From our perspective, we move equipment between rigs. And so, the actual -- we're not in the rig business. So, the rig contracted status of rigs is not really impactful to us. The key is operators focus on continuing to drill and develop offshore resources, which we see a lot of strength around that, whether it's 20,000 in the Gulf of Mexico, I mean, there's just a lot of foot, and so there's a lot of probably back and forth in the rig business in terms of contracting and gaps and managing timing, but that doesn't impact us. We're working with clients. They have rigs available and they are either executing work or planning work and really bought a bit of exciting work around the world and in the Gulf of Mexico.
Saurabh Pant: Okay. Fantastic. No, that's good color, Jeff. And then just one quick clarification on, Jeff, I think you made the comment in your prepared remarks about 90% of your fleet committed for [indiscernible]. That's really impressive like I think [indiscernible] Q&A ask. But my follow-up is, do we know at least roughly what the pricing on those fleets are going to look like, right? So basically, do we have line of sight on the profitability as well versus just activity on those fleets?
Jeff Miller: Look, yes, we do have some of that, but we obviously work through that as well. What I would say about without getting into details because I won't. We're sticking with our strategy, which is to stay out of the spot market size the fleet to the market that we see as we've described, and we've been successful in getting things to work. We obviously don't exist in a vacuum. But at the same time, I believe Halliburton, and I know Halliburton reflects the performance and the technology that we bring to the market, which puts us at the high end of the range, and I get told that every single day. So, I'm well aware of where we are from that perspective. But confident that our strategies in place, and we're executing on the strategy that's gotten us to hear.
Saurabh Pant: Okay. No, fantastic. As a market leader, what do you do in that industry, obviously decides where the market goes? So, it's good to hear that. And if I may, Eric, very quick one. I know you're not guiding to '25 CapEx yet. But broad strokes, can we still think about 6% of revenue for next year?
Eric Carre: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Jeff, as you -- as we all know, right, you're in constant communication with your cohorts at the oil and gas companies, and there's been a lot of noise, right, concerns about oil demand growth, concerns about excess OPEC capacity. And obviously, in the broader markets, that's weighed on the price of crude, right? So, in the conversations that you've had of late, right, it sounds like there's a bit more optimism or a constructive outlook that your customer base has maybe relative to the commodity market or the equity market. So just hoping you can give us some insights on how you're assessing those conversations, what you've seen risk things to give that sense of optimism, and what you could potentially help translate to the people on this call?
Jeff Miller: Certainly. Look, I think that some of this is around the types of players in the market today. And I mean, these are very serious, large, well-capitalized operators. And so, as part of the E&P consolidation, it's gone sort of as expected in the sense that customers clearly want technology and efficiency. These large players have a larger baseload of work, they're stable. They plan to work through the cycle. It does create more contractable opportunities for us in terms of Zeus fleet and Zeus platform. But I think some of the optimism that you hear is; a, these aren't customers that ever react to short swings in commodity pricing. These are operators that build a plan, execute a plan, and I'm so pleased to work with these customers because that kind of clarity helps us run our business. I think probably some of that optimism you hear is we are getting better at what we do. They see paths to be more productive and they've got capital to go do it. And the commodity price today is clearly well within a range that drives consistent activity. And so -- and I think that there'll be a lot of interest in keeping oil and gas in a range that creates profitability for our clients and profitability for us. And that this industry continues to grow and just get -- becoming more and more effective, productive, profitable industry.
Kurt Hallead: Great. I always appreciate the color, Jeff. Now maybe a follow-up for Eric, just on that CapEx question, right? So, in the fourth quarter, if the math maps out correctly, it looks like you're going to be about $450 million in CapEx, which is about $100 million higher than what you had been for quarterly run rate. You mentioned a couple of new e-fleets. So can we connect the dots and suggests that the incremental CapEx is -- the bulk of that is going to go toward the e-fleet rollout. And then just as an extension to that, you referenced 6% of CapEx for next year. In that 6% of CapEx of revenue for next year, how many e-fleets or are you assuming any additional et additions?
Jeff Miller: Yes, I'll take that. Let me take that in terms of e-fleets going forward. E-fleets, again, we look at that from a pull standpoint, not a push the endpoint. So, we do expect deliveries in 2025. We've got some of those already planned and expect to do that, and we've also -- anyway. So that's where we are. I think the CapEx, I'm going to hand the forecasting to Eric.
Eric Carre: As I mentioned earlier, the CapEx still intended to be 6%. Look, it's going to be a little higher than 6% this year as we revised revenue compared to the projection we had at the beginning of the year, and we had a lot of equipment and flat. I mean, we're still dealing with lead time on big pieces of capital equipment between six months and over a year. But as we look into next year, it's 6%. It's a balance between CD&E balance between the projection that we have for revenue in North America and international and the overall ratios continue to evolve as our business evolves and becomes more and more internationally weighted.
Operator: Thank you. And that is all the time we have for Q&A today. I will turn the call back to Jeff Miller for his final comments.
Jeff Miller: Yes, Carmen, thank you. As we close out today's call, I just want to leave you with this. I see solid growth opportunities for Halliburton across our business lines and geographies. I'm confident in our international business and its strong technology portfolio, unique value proposition and clear strategy. In North America, we are widening the moat around our Zeus platform, and we expect to keep growing our drilling business services in North America. So, I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And with that, we close today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-19 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Second Quarter 2024 Halliburton Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to David Coleman, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
David Coleman: Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton second quarter 2024 conference call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton delivered solid second quarter results that demonstrated the strength of our international business and the differentiation of our North America service offerings. Here are the quarter highlights. We delivered total company revenue of $5.8 billion and operating margin of 18%. International revenue was $3.4 billion and grew 8% year-over-year, led by Latin America, which delivered a 10% increase. North America revenue was $2.5 billion, an 8% decrease year-over-year compared to a 12% decline in rig count over the same period. Our Drilling and Evaluation division and our Completion and Production division both demonstrated margin improvement year-over-year. Finally, during the second quarter we generated $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations and about $800 million of free cash flow and repurchased $250 million of our common stock. I'll begin our discussion with the international markets, where Halliburton's strategy of profitable growth delivered another solid quarter. International revenue grew 8% year-over-year, with growth demonstrated by each region. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in our international business. As I look ahead for the remainder of this year, my outlook today is consistent with our expectations at the start of the year. I expect steady growth for Halliburton throughout the remainder of 2024. In our international markets, we see strong demand for Halliburton services, high activity levels, and equipment tightness across all major basins. We expect our international business to deliver about 10% revenue growth for the full year. I am pleased with the profitable growth we're seeing across our product lines. And today, I would like to highlight three specific ones in more detail. The first is our Landmark Software business. I recently attended our Landmark Forum, LIFE2024, in Athens, Greece. It is an annual event where we share our latest software innovations and our customers share their successes and future opportunities. While in Athens, I had the opportunity to meet with dozens of customers and they told me how excited they were about our latest offerings like unified ensemble modeling, scalable earth model, and our latest developments in AI and machine learning. These tools change the way customers work by driving efficiencies from asset level planning through production. The conference included customer presentations that showcased their business transformation and their use of Halliburton Landmark’s tools. Our customers tell us we create unique value with our iEnergy cloud platform, which seamlessly integrates into their workflows. I am confident that Landmark's DecisionSpace 365 will expand and add to our customers' productivity and innovation journey. Next, Halliburton's artificial lift product line is growing in the international markets at double the rate of our overall international business. It embodies our successful M&A strategy of bolt-on acquisitions that bring leading technology into our portfolio. We organically grow new technologies through our global footprint and through collaboration with our customers to engineer solutions that maximize their assets value. As one example, this quarter we launched our GeoESP line, which is engineered for the harsh geothermal environment. The GeoESP line solves for extreme thermal cycling, scale development, abrasion, and corrosion. While geothermal ESP technology has applications across the globe, Halliburton sees substantial growth opportunities in Europe where customers require advanced technology to bring geothermal to scale. Finally, Halliburton's drilling services are key to our success in the international markets. We had another strong quarter in unconventional drilling with our iCruise X rotary steerable system and our LOGIX autonomous drilling platform. We deployed advancements that improved drilling speed and reliability and set several [general] (ph) records during the quarter. We invest in differentiated drilling technology and we expect our strong performance and reliable execution to drive above-market growth. For example, in the Middle East, our drilling services revenue grew about 30% year-over-year. I am pleased with our international business and look forward to deepening our strategy and delivering additional profitable growth. Turning to North America, our second quarter revenue declined 3% compared to the first quarter. Halliburton's first half 2024 results were largely as we expected. However, as we have seen, rig counts and overall service activity declined through the quarter. As I look to the second half of 2024, I now expect full year North America revenues to decline 6% to 8% versus last year, driven by lower activity. I expect that the second half of 2024 will be near the low point of activity levels this cycle, and while it's too early to give specific guidance for 2025 in North America, I expect activity to be directionally higher than the second half of 2024. Here's how I think about this. First, I expect an increase in activity after E&P companies complete their acquisitions and establish new development plans. Second, some of the merged assets will be divested to smaller operators who will put them to work. Finally, I expect some recovery in natural gas activity. Six years ago, when we set our strategy to maximize value in North America, I understood it may take a market like we see today where North America activity declined by over 200 rigs in the last 18 months to demonstrate the margin resilience and earnings power of our strategy. I am pleased that Halliburton delivered strong C&P margins through this period and I am confident that our strategy will deliver strong results in the future. We're committed to our strategy to maximize value in North America because it delivers shareholder value and it is the right strategy for this market. For Halliburton, we focused on returns. We allocate capital to the markets and products that drive superior returns and margins. We prioritize returns over market share, and to that end, we retired a few fleets this quarter. We developed differentiated technologies to solve for the unique requirements of the North America market. And lastly, we improve efficiencies for our customers through those technologies, service quality, and execution. I expect this strategy will deliver leading performance for our customers and a structurally more resilient North America business for Halliburton. A key part of how we do this is our strategic investment in technology. One technology I'm excited about is the latest addition to Octiv, a key component of the ZEUS platform. Today, Octiv is a cornerstone of how we deliver large multi-well pads with unmatched precision and consistency. As our customers execute completions with ever-increasing size and intensity, automation, as delivered by Octiv, provides better control and more effective delivery for simul-frac and trimulfrac operations. During the second quarter, we completed field trials of the latest level of Octiv automation called AutoFrac. With the single click of a button, AutoFrac executes the entire frac job from ramp up at the start to ramp down at the end, making autonomous fracturing a reality. This new level of automation gives customers control to execute the frac design exactly how they want it without human intervention. Following our commercial trials, AutoFrac is ready to scale and I'm excited about what this technology means for our customers and for Halliburton. Lastly, we see rapid adoption in North America of our iCruise rotary steerable system. We consistently reduce drilling times for our customers and create significant value. In the Permian Basin, the number of rigs running the system has increased by almost 45% since the start of this year. We are on pace to triple our footage drilled in North America this year and I'm excited about the market adoption of iCruise. North America is the largest oilfield services market in the world. We are crystal clear on how we maximize value in North America. We have demonstrated that this strategy works. And that's why I am confident that we will continue to deliver strong returns through this cycle. To step back, Halliburton's returns and cash flows are strong and I am pleased with our performance this quarter. I'm just back from a few weeks in Europe/Africa. What I saw is a microcosm of Halliburton around the world. The quality of our people, the clarity of our strategy, our leading technologies, the depth of our pipeline of opportunities, and the competitiveness of our business segments all give me incredible confidence in Halliburton's future. Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide a few more details on our financial results. Eric?
Eric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q2 reported net income per diluted share was $0.80. Total company revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $5.8 billion, flat sequentially. Operating income was $1 billion, a sequential increase of 5%, and operating margin was 18%, a sequential increase of 69 basis points. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in Q2 was $3.4 billion, sequentially flat. Operating income was $723 million, up 5% when compared to Q1 2024, and operating income margin was 21%. These results were primarily driven by strong international completion and production performance, offsetting softer results in North America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q2 was $2.4 billion, while operating income was $403 million, both sequentially flat from Q1 2024. Operating margin was 17%, a sequential increase of 20 basis points. These results reflect the strength of our global D&E business despite the roll-off of seasonal software sales in Q2 which affected every region. Now, let's move on to geographic results. Our Q2 international revenue increased 3% sequentially. Europe/Africa revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $757 million, an increase of 4% sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by higher well construction activity and improved wireline activity in Norway, along with increased completion tool sales and higher stimulation activity in West Africa. Middle East Asia revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $1.5 billion, an increase of 5% sequentially. This increase was primarily related to higher activity in the Middle East across multiple product lines and higher fluid services in Asia. Latin America revenue in the second quarter of 2024 was $1.1 billion, sequentially flat. In North America, revenue was $2.5 billion, representing a 3% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in US land and decreased completion tool sales and testing services in the Gulf of Mexico. Moving on to other items. In Q2, our corporate and other expense was $65 million. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect our corporate expenses to increase slightly. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and is on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q2, we spend $29 million, or about $0.03 per diluted share, on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For the third quarter, we expect SAP expenses to increase slightly. Net interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. For the third quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly flat. Other, net expense for Q2 was $20 million, which was lower than anticipated, driven by favorable FX movements. For the third quarter of 2024, we expect this expense to be approximately $35 million. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 22.5%, lower than expected due to discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter of 2024 effective tax rate to increase approximately 1%. Capital expenditures for Q2 were $347 million. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q2 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $793 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of our common stock. For the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow to be at least 10% higher than in 2023. Now, let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the third quarter. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be down 1% to 3% and margins to decrease by 75 basis points to 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to increase 2% to 4% and margins to increase by 25 basis points to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. Here are a few key points I would like you to take away from our discussion today. I am pleased with our 18% margins and about $800 million of free cash flow in the second quarter. We are well on track to deliver over 10% free cash flow growth this year. I'm excited about our international business where our technology portfolio has never been stronger. I am confident that our strategy to maximize value in North America is working, and I expect it continues to deliver strong returns. Finally, I am convinced that our collaborative approach and value proposition differentiate us from our competitors and are directly aligned with how our customers expect to drive improved performance. And now, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Dave Anderson with Barclays.
Dave Anderson: Hi, good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Dave.
Dave Anderson: So, North America is softening a little bit, not a surprise. A lot of your fleet, though, is under contract with e-fleet. I think it's around 40% or so. And you're continuing to roll out equipment. So I'm just wondering about the re-contracting of those. I think you typically have like two to three year contracts. I would assume, like, maybe a third of that gets repriced each year or something like that. So what does that look like right now in terms of contracting? I think -- I'm assuming demand still outstrips supply here. So, is pricing able to still move higher in there? Are you doing to blend in, extend deals with some customers who want more? Just a little color around the repricing of that, on the e-fleets.
Jeff Miller: Yeah, well let's -- still see a lot of demand, Dave, for e-fleets. I mean, clearly it's a leading technology and we rolled a couple out this quarter and signed some more contracts. And so, that's a runway through the end of this year and into ‘25 that we see today. We don't have any contracts that expires early till next year. And so, that's a process that we're working through. I'm not going to go through all that on this call, but we're signing up with repeat customers, which is a pretty good indicator of the value that they're creating. So, feel confident about that process, but really don't want to go through it on the call.
Dave Anderson: Totally understand. But would you expect that most of those fleets stay with existing customers?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, I feel -- yes. Yes, still confident. I mean, these are the same customers in some cases that are signing up the second and even beyond their fleets. And so, no reason to believe that they would not. And we’re clearly on the path to the 40% in 2024 and 2025 as well. I mean, I think that's just that trajectory gets clearer every day.
Dave Anderson: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And if I shift over to your international story here, and within the 10% revenue growth, you highlighted Middle East up 5% this quarter sequentially. Can you just talk about that part of the international story for you and kind of how you see that growth? Should growth start to accelerate here? There's big unconventional play over there that I know you're involved in. I don't know if you can talk about any other contracting opportunities with that, but I would -- am I wrong to think that that growth should start to accelerate in the Middle East, even, I mean, within the 10%, I know, but really into next year as well?
Jeff Miller: No, you're not wrong. Look, I'm very confident around our business in the Middle East and as you say, I'm not going to talk about contracts, but Aramco obviously is a fantastic operator and we've got a lot of exposure to both the unconventional and the gas work in Saudi Arabia. We've got -- our typical services, a lot of exposure and even some creative sort of new things. So, I'm very optimistic, actually bullish around Middle East.
Dave Anderson: All right, it's good to hear. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram: Yeah, good morning. Jeff, my first question is on North America. You now expect revenues down 6% to 8% year-over-year. How would you characterize the declines in terms of impact from lower activity levels versus, call it, pricing impacts?
Jeff Miller: Look, it's -- primarily this is activity based. The fact that we -- and then we retired a few fleets during the quarter as well, but this is activity and that's, as we look at activity for the year, gas market actually took a leg down. I didn't think it would come up, but I didn't really expect it to take a leg down either, so it's not flat. And I think M&A takes some time to digest, and so that has an impact on activity broadly and clearly efficiencies. I mean, we've got terrific technology. We talk about efficiencies all the time, but we also catch up to rigs. Glad we're at the leading edge of that technology and that performance makes Halliburton more value, but it really doesn't change the activity outlook.
Arun Jayaram: Understood, understood. Jeff, you've obviously been on the road quite a bit internationally. You expect 10% year-over-year growth this year. I was wondering if you could give us any qualitative or even quantitative thoughts on how you think international spending trends in 2025 for industry and how is growth prospects internationally next year?
Jeff Miller: Look, they look strong for next year internationally. I mean, we see a lot of projects that are either just now being hindered or activity going into next year and in some cases, it takes a while to get the international up and going. And so, probably the activity that picks up [indiscernible] will be where it's sort of NOC driven, which would look in some cases like obviously the Middle East. Others where IOCs are engaged, it takes a lot of negotiation, contract extensions for them. And so, I'm seeing meaningful work. I just talked about my trip to Europe, Africa, and I see meaningful step-up there. Still excited about Latin America and what's possible there. And so, no, I feel really confident both in Halliburton's outlook for ‘25 and the industries.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.
Jeff Miller: Yeah, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Yeah, good morning, team. Jeff, I guess the first question just building on North America, what do you think is going to be the driver that forms the bottom in activity? I think you alluded to some of those points around M&A and natural gas, but maybe you can unpack that more. And are you seeing any green shoots in customer conversations that would suggest that $2.8 trillion is the bottom?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, look, I think that customers, in a lot of cases, are working through plans for 2025 now. And, let me maybe just step back and give you kind of where I see capacity and industry structure, because I think that's really important from a services standpoint. We've got -- new equipment is not being built. The old equipment is attriting. And I think that, I talked about retiring fleets this quarter. I mean, this is sort of shrinking of capacity availability and it's happening pretty much in real time, I think, across the board. And clearly as we look at next year, I say all that to say, I do expect an increase in activity around companies that get sort of new plans in place. I expect assets end up in the hands of new teams, which is -- I never bet against North America entrepreneurs. That will happen. I do expect some pick up in gas next year, at least not a leg down from here. So, clearly, I would expect a leg up. And I don't think it takes a lot of activity to firm things up, I think, is the point I'm making here.
Neil Mehta: Thanks, Jeff. And then just to follow up, it was a very good quarter for free cash flow and the company has been very consistent around $250 million of return of capital. So there's probably two parts to that question. One is, how should we think about working capital in the balance of the year and how should we think about your commitment to returning capital to shareholders?
Eric Carre: Yeah, Neil, it's Eric. So as we said in terms of the working capital, I mean the working capital will evolve in a way that is consistent with our overall guidance of free cash flow being up over 10% compared to last year. We had more of a working capital headwinds in 2023, so that's a significant delta between the two years. And as an organization, we continue to focus on the overall efficiency of working capital as a whole. In terms of cash return, we bought back $250 million in Q1, $250 million in Q2, and I think generally speaking, it's a good kind of guiding point in terms of what we intend at this stage to do for the remaining of 2024.
Neil Mehta: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: Hey, good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, James.
James West: So, Jeff, as you think about -- and I don't want to beat a dead horse too much, but if you think about North America going into next year, I'm increasingly bullish on the outlook for ‘25 and certainly for ‘26, both with oil prices where they are and gas prices which should rebound nicely. And we have this huge power demand pull coming from the tech industry. And I think the tech industry is more fully aligned with the oil and gas industry than it's probably ever been. So I'm curious about your customer conversations, how they're thinking about, how do we get this gas to market, how do we size up crews or size up equipment and get ready for what's going to be a surge in demand and kind of pair that with constructing more natural gas-fired power generation and things of that nature to meet data centers and AI demand? How are your conversations kind of evolving there?
Jeff Miller: Look, there's a lot of discussion around what to do with gas. I think your point around data centers and alignment, it just -- in my view, that will be takeaway for gas at some point. Seems easier to lay data lines and gas pipelines. And the -- gas is such a fantastic fuel and resource for this country that I think it's directionally absolutely correct. In terms of timing, I think that will come on. I think it's early to still work through the mechanics of what that means to plants but I expect all that's coming together in the degree to which gas gets taken away that only creates more runway for oil in the Permian Basin. So I'm like -- I'm -- share your excitement around what data centers and AI mean for our industry in terms of natural gas takeaway and we've got a pretty good seat at that and get to watch it really closely and excited.
James West: Got it. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then iCruise, you mentioned adoption. Now, I mean, we had great adoption internationally, but it sounds like you're getting better adoption in the US as well. Could you maybe highlight, kind of, what you're seeing with the iCruise and technology and how that's unfolding?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, thanks. Look, man, I'm really pleased with the technology in North America and I really like the way we're going to market with it because you were going to market with full services, our own services, we’re also selling direct sales and some rentals and that tells me three things about the technology. It tells me, A, it's in high demand. B, it tells me that it's very reliable because we could sell it that way and C, it's delivering performance And I'm really pleased with the customers that are adopting it because in my view, this kind of adoption is really, these are the gold standard of, in my view, drillers that, good drilling organizations that pick this tool up and say, wow, we really like it. We want more of it. And so, like I said, I think we've got a really good runway around drilling in North America and it's all rooted in sort of investments we've made over quite a few years, but I believe we're there today.
James West: Got it. North America is a nice cash flow machine for you guys. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.
Luke Lemoine: Hey, good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Luke.
Luke Lemoine: Hey, morning. If you kind of revised the international outlook a little bit for this year, could you walk us through some of the puts and takes that have unfolded, or is some of this just a push into ‘25 on the spend?
Jeff Miller: Well, look, we're sort of halfway through the year and we've got really good visibility into the balance of the year. And so I didn't think we'd hit the high end of the range. So wanted to tighten that up for you guys as we look out. Q4 will be the highest international quarter we have, typically with software sales and tool sales. But day in and day out, we're continuing to grow, and we're very focused on profitable growth. And as I think I alluded to earlier, my expectation is that we see a continuing march internationally of growth. And oil price says that, our clients are saying that, my own project inventory is saying that. So if you describe it as a push, that's one way to think about it. But just from where we sit today, I know what we can get done and I thought it would be worthwhile to narrow that a bit.
Luke Lemoine: Okay. And then you touched on it a little bit earlier, but could you walk through some of the various unconventional international opportunities you're seeing develop over the next two or three years?
Jeff Miller: Certainly. Look, Saudi Arabia and Argentina today are meaningful markets that are -- really have heft and are executing. The -- and I think what has changed and so the rest of the middle east I'm excited about and Middle East is a pretty big place if you think about it in terms of sort of from the Mediterranean all the way to back into Saudi, that's a long way. But there's a lot of activity being talked about. And I think we're right in the middle of those, I think. I know we're in the middle of those discussions. We've got a lot of experience in this. And I think what's different today is the sort of ability to accept sort of what the testing is. The early days activity of this, I think there's a lot of sort of we've seen starts and stops internationally, but now we have a proven model in two international markets where you get through the initial phase and then it becomes a meaningful contributor to production and I think that's being sort of seen by other places where they have good reservoirs, good rock and working through, I think, very thoughtfully and pragmatically what does it take to get from A to B. And so from my perspective, that's a much better discussion than sort of a scramble or wildcat sort of move all over the world. These are very serious operators that are taking a long view.
Luke Lemoine: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Saurabh Pant with Bank of America.
Saurabh Pant: Hi. Good morning, Jeff and Eric.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Saurabh.
Eric Carre: Hey, Saurabh. How are you?
Saurabh Pant: Good. Thank you. Maybe, Jeff, I'll start with a question on D&E margin. Obviously, Eric, you guided to the third quarter, but anything beyond that, not just fourth quarter, but ‘25, how should we think about margin expansion opportunity because this is a primarily international driven business, right? How should we think about the impact from net pricing improvement, technology uptake? I know you talked about Landmark, right? But just help us a little bit with the margin expansion opportunity in D&E.
Eric Carre: Yeah, I think the way to look at D&E margins is really the progression on year-on-year basis. There tends to be quite a bit of difference between different quarters as we recognize revenue around software impacts mostly Q1, Q4, et cetera. So it's really the year-on-year progression by quarter that you need to pay attention to from that perspective. We continue to improve the margins in D&E. We firmly believe that it continues as we get into next year. Jeff talked about the progression of the directional drilling business in North America. We continue to see progression and adoption of the new drilling technologies in the international markets as well. So directionally, we continue to be very confident in the growth of our D&E margins as we go into 2025.
Jeff Miller: Maybe a little more color on that, because when I think about our drilling business, we rolled out iCruise, which is the drilling tool, the BHA, and then, that penetration has grown to -- we're drilling a lot more feet with our iCruise than we are our legacy tools. Probably, 60%, 70% percent of our fleet is that today. But what follows on that is an equal sort of step-up in efficiency, performance and actually margin for us around our iStar technology, which is basically the LWD technology that goes with it. And that adoption or actually implementation is much less, I want to say, in the 20% range. So we've got a very good glide path of things that structurally improve margins for the most part D&E. And so I see that as part of my confidence around, look, we just need to continue to retire the old as it's time and replace it with the new. And that is structurally improving our capital efficiency.
Saurabh Pant: Okay, fantastic. Now that's helpful. And just one on the production side of things. I know you talked about artificial lifting in your prepared remarks. Good to see international growing at a much faster pace than the overall international market for lift. But if we focus on the production chemicals side of things, I know you acquired Athlon, you've been investing time and money to expand that business, right? Maybe just update us on that, Jeff, where does the production chemicals fit and what's the opportunity just on that side for Halliburton?
Jeff Miller: Well, according to that business, it's clearly part of our portfolio, but it's also an inherently sort of lower returning business than the balance of our business. So we run it like all of our business with a focus on profitability and returns. I'm pleased at the pace we're filling our plant in Saudi Arabia. And that business has a long sales cycle. But we know a lot about chemicals and continue to execute that.
Saurabh Pant: Okay, fantastic. Okay, Jeff, Eric, thank you. I’ll turn it back.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Eric Carre: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citi.
Scott Gruber: Yes, good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning.
Eric Carre: Good morning.
Scott Gruber: Good morning. I'm curious, diesel prices have come off a little bit and there's hopes for a natural gas price recovery next year. So, Jeff, I'm curious, what gas price would close the cost of fuel delta between e-frac when using CNG and traditional diesel? I don't think it's $4 or $5 gas. I want to check that with you and just overall how would you describe e-frac economics even in an environment of healthier gas?
Jeff Miller: It's a couple things. It's a lot higher than that to start with. I mean if we just use sort of Btu 6 times, 6 times 4, at $4, you're still a long way from diesel prices. The other thing is the efficiency of the mousetrap. I mean, it's just -- our e-fleets are creating value well beyond the economic trade-off with gas. That's not to say there isn't a lot of runway around economic trade-off with gas, but that platform in and of itself is just a better operating machine and it provides technology for clients that really they can't get -- that's not available in another form. And whether that's AutoFrac, Octiv, what we're doing with sensory in terms of understanding recovery, a lot of this. And so we're able to help solve for delivering what was planned with precision and in measuring performance of what was placed in the reservoir. That's a whole different kettle of fish, but it's all attached to the ZEUS platform. And so all of that runs together. So when I think about e-fleets broadly, yes, there is the gas arbitrage which is happening all the time and like I said, long way to go on gas arbitrage before that ever comes up. But I think more importantly is what we're able to achieve with that technology for our customers.
Scott Gruber: Makes a lot of sense. And ultimately it sounds like Octiv and AutoFrac are going to help kind of further that ultimate penetration for e-frac with your customers and kind of extend any type of saturation point that ultimately could be hit. Just as you think a few years out, as you develop these softwares, develop a platform for a more efficient operation, where do you think e-frac goes as a percent of Halliburton’s fleet? And kind of when do you get there?
Jeff Miller: Well, look, I think we talked about this. We'll eclipse 40% this year. I expect we're at 50% next year. And we continue to invest both in the -- we're at scale today. And that allows us then to both improve or continue to extend the technology around the pump itself and the power systems, and then also the software that we're talking about that really addresses in my view what operators are focused on which is recovery and placement and a whole lot of things that affect productivity over time. And so we're extending that moat around that technology every day. And so I'm confident that as we continue into the future, we've got quite a glide path of ideas and things that will make that, yet again, even more effective for customers over time. So, pleased with where we are there.
Scott Gruber: I appreciate the color, Jeff. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Becker with Capital One.
Doug Becker: Hello?
Jeff Miller: Doug?
Doug Becker: Yes, can you hear me?
Jeff Miller: I can, good morning.
Doug Becker: So, Halliburton's North America revenue is regularly outperforming the North America rig count. Just wondering if you could just highlight some of the key drivers of that outperformance that you expect going forward and really asking to try and calibrate how Halliburton's North American revenue might outperform the rig count next year.
Jeff Miller: I think a lot of it, it's -- e-fleets are contracted. That's a large part of our business. The performance is leading in terms of efficiency and technology and we continue to invest in technology that differentiates Halliburton. And that's one of the key things. I mean, it's consistent with our strategy. I'll pivot back to our strategy just for a minute but we want to -- maximizing value in North America means that we're very targeted about what we do, what we invest in, where we spend money and on those things that we know will create differentiation. And clearly, technology is one of those key areas and not technology for the sake of technology but targeted technology that can solve for automation, that can solve for subsurface understanding and measurements, direct measurements. And so, that focus allows us to outperform on the revenue side of that and the maximize value again. That strategy hasn't changed at all and gives me a lot of confidence into ‘25 and beyond in terms of where Halliburton is in the market.
Doug Becker: I mean, is it too aggressive to think about in a flat North America rig count environment? Halliburton’s revenue is still growing 5% next year in that type of environment.
Jeff Miller: Yeah, I mean, it could be. We need to watch it unfold next year. But look, I -- again, I'll go back to -- our performance in the market is going to outperform. It's early on ‘25 but I’ve got confidence in the technology and the solutions that we provide for our customers that are unique and that puts us in the position to outperform.
Doug Becker: Right. That completely makes sense. And then just a quick one on the e-fleets. We've been hearing more talk about white space even on dedicated or contracted fleets. Just wanted to get a little bit better sense for your e-fleets. Is there any risk of white space? I fully appreciate that they're long-term contracts and they justify the returns, but just thinking about any potential white space risk on those contracts.
Jeff Miller: No, not the case. Our clients -- that contract -- again, these are contracted with customers with long programs, they're going to use these e-fleets. It will be always -- if there were white space, this is the fleet that they will keep working no matter what. It is -- when you're delivering lower cost of ownership, you are -- and delivering the technology and the client is committed to the fleet, that's the fleet that's always working. And so, no, not worried about that.
Doug Becker: That's what I wanted to hear. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our last question today will come from Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen.
Marc Bianchi: Hey, thank you. The first one I had was on the activity outlook. Jeff, you mentioned that it could improve here from the second half of ‘24, but it sounds like you're stopping short of talking about revenue. And I guess maybe following on some of Doug's question, when you look at how hard it is to call revenue, is price -- uncertainty about price the main thing or maybe talk about the top one, two or three things that are uncertain around revenue versus activity.
Jeff Miller: No, I think the uncertainty around activity is really the driver here. And when we look at the second half of the year, we've had some customers that did -- we caught up with them and they're still customers and they plan to go to work again next year and maybe even later this year. So no, that's not my concern. It is, again, I'll pivot back to our strategy in terms of maximizing value. We've got a lot of tools that allow us to do that technically. And, I think it's just a question of pacing of things happening in -- whether it's setting plans or other things. But, the ‘25 will be, in my view, clearly higher than the second half of 2024.
Marc Bianchi: Okay, great. And then the other one I had, maybe this one's for Eric, but just looking at the third quarter guide for C&P, the margin reduction sequentially seems pretty steep for the revenue reduction we're getting. Could you talk about maybe some of the moving pieces there, what might be driving that margin weakness?
Eric Carre: Yes, I mean, there's the -- the margin guidance is actually a combination of what we talked about for North America, but really Q3 margins in the international business are going to be lower than Q2 as well. So there's just not too much to read into this except there's a lot of moving parts in the business. It's not just North America. It's multiple product lines as well. So it is not all related to North America.
Marc Bianchi: Yeah. Great. Thank you. I'll turn it back.
Operator: That concludes today's question…
Jeff Miller: Okay. Well, thank you. Let's wrap up the call here. I know all of you have a very busy day ahead of you, and maybe I'll give you a few minutes back before your next call. But as we close out today's call, it's important to step back and remember this. Halliburton delivered 18% margins and about $800 million of free cash flow in the second quarter. We're well on track to deliver 10% free cash flow growth this year. Our international business and its technology portfolio have never been stronger. Our strategy to maximize value in North America is working. We are committed to maximizing value, not market share, and I expect that strategy continues to deliver strong returns. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-23 09:00:00) =====
David Coleman: Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President, and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter earnings release and in the Quarterly Results & Presentation section of our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Halliburton delivered solid first quarter results that again demonstrated the power of our strategy and the strength of our execution. Here are the quarter highlights. We delivered total company revenue of $5.8 billion, and operating margin of 17%. Both divisions demonstrated margin improvement year-over-year. International revenue was $3.3 billion, and grew 12% year-over-year, led by Latin America, which delivered a 21% increase. North America revenue was $2.5 billion, a 5% increase over the fourth quarter of 2023. Finally, during the first quarter, we generated $487 million of cash flow from operations, $206 million of free cash flow, and repurchased $250 million of our common stock. Let me begin today's discussion with my views on the strength of the oilfield services market. Global energy use is on the rise, with crude oil demand projected to grow between 1.2 million and 2.3 million barrels per day in 2024. This demand growth is greatest in non-OECD countries, where we expect more per capita energy consumption, not less as they develop their economies and improve their quality of life. Globally, secure, reliable hydrocarbon production powers industries, moves people, and advances economies. In the U.S., after stable electricity demand for nearly two decades, we now expect it to grow more than 15% by 2030. Today, over 40% of United States electricity is supplied by natural gas, and we expect strong demand for natural gas as a base fuel well into the future. The world requires more energy, not less, and I'm more convinced than ever that oil and gas will fill a critical role in the global energy mix for decades to come. My outlook is confirmed by our customers' multiyear activity plans across multiple markets and asset types. Everything I see points towards long-term growth for Halliburton's services. My outlook for the industry is not new, and it drives our focus on oilfield services, and sets our strategy. This focus is the basis for our technology investment, capital allocation, and culture. This multiyear upcycle together with our successful strategy execution make this a great time for Halliburton. Now, let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's strategy of profitable growth delivered another solid quarter. International revenue grew 12% year-over-year with growth demonstrated by each region. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in our international business. For 2024, I expect full-year revenue growth in the low double-digits. Equally important, the international market remains tight for equipment, and people, and therefore, we expect to see margin expansion over last year. One of the many things that excites me about our international business is our technology that creates meaningful value for our customers, and drives above-market growth for Halliburton. In the Drilling and Evaluation Division, our leading formation evaluation tools such as the EarthStar X logging-while-drilling system, and our Reservoir Xaminer Formation Sampling Service, both see strong adoption and increasing levels of demand. The advanced measurements these systems provide create unique insights for our customers and drive profitable growth for Halliburton. In the Completion and Production division, our Artificial Lift technology continues to generate profitable growth throughout each of our international regions. Our electric submersible pump portfolio proved to be a market leader in the competitive North America market, and we expect to deliver similar results over time in the international markets. Our complete solution, which includes downhole motors, pumps, and surface systems with remote monitoring and automation, provides an end-to-end solution, and the ability to operate at scale. A great example is in Kuwait, where in less than three years, we captured a nearly 20% market share with over 700 ESP installs. Before we move on, I want to share an observation. I'm consistently seeing more global interest in unconventionals. I can recall over a decade ago, the global scramble to find unconventionals with limited success. Today, two significant markets outside of North America achieve scale, which serves as a proof point for what is possible, and drives interest by others. As global markets grow, the technologies and processes Halliburton developed as the leader in North America over the last three decades have broad applications to unconventional reservoirs throughout the world, which makes this a fantastic long-term opportunity for Halliburton. I'm confident in the duration of this international upcycle in 2024 and beyond. Turning to North America, our first quarter revenue grew 5% over last quarter. As expected, North America land completion activity bottomed in the fourth quarter of last year and rebounded in the first quarter as our customers quickly resumed operations after the holidays. Looking ahead for the rest of 2024 in North America, we expect steady activity levels for Halliburton. Our customers are planning for the long-term and I expect they will execute work throughout the year as planned. This is consistent with a more industrialized approach to asset development in North America. And while we expect an eventual recovery in natural gas activity driven by demand from LNG expansions, our 2024 plan does not anticipate this recovery. Overall, we expect that full-year North America revenue and margins will be flattish compared with 2023 levels. Clearly, our strategy is to maximize value in North America. We do it in multiple ways. Today, I want to talk about two of them. The first is the ZEUS platform and the second is our new North America focused directional drilling system. The ZEUS platform, its electrification, automation and subsurface diagnostics continue to advance. This quarter, we introduced Sensory, which is the latest generation of our subsurface measurement technology. Sensory provides an easy to deploy, cost effective and automated system for real time subsurface measurement of fracturing operations. Additionally, our automation technologies are at the heart of our highly efficient simul-frac and trimul-frac operations and they continue to expand their capabilities creating value for Halliburton and our customers. The ZEUS platform demonstrates its uniqueness every day. And importantly, it's deployed at scale. Our scale allows for rapid technology innovation. Each technology improvement to the ZEUS platform widens the moat around our leading position in the fracturing market. This creates outsized value for Halliburton and our customers. I am pleased with the results we see in North America from our drilling services product line, which late last year launched a new version of our iCruise Rotary Steerable System specifically engineered for the North America unconventional market. The new iCruise CX system is designed for the challenging curve and lateral applications in North America. The system's performance is driving strong uptake and this quarter, our iCruise footage drilled in North America more than doubled over last year. We also coupled this high performing system with an asset light sales and rental model that increases the addressable market when compared to a full-service model. This is how iCruise CX both participates in new market segments and increases its speed of market penetration. The key trend that I see in North America drilling is the move to longer laterals and more complex wells which customers drill to improve economics. iCruise CX is specifically designed for these applications. And its performance is why I am excited about Halliburton's growth in the North America drilling market. To close out, I would like to thank our employees. I regularly hear from our customers about the work you do. How much it means to them, and how your execution of our value proposition differentiates Halliburton from our competitors. Well done. I am excited about the business outlook for Halliburton. Energy demand growth is strong and so is demand for our services. I expect that our focus on oilfield services and execution of our strategy will generate strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. This quarter, Halliburton repurchased $250 million of our common stock, a solid start to the year and a good benchmark for our expectations going forward. Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details of our financial results. Eric?
Eric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q1 reported net income per diluted share was $0.68. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.76. Total company revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $5.8 billion. Operating income was $987 million. And operating margin was 17%; flat compared to Q1 2023. Beginning with our Completion and Production division; revenue in Q1 was $3.4 billion, down slightly from Q1 2023. Operating income was $688 million, up 3% when compared to Q1 2023. And operating income margin was 20%. Compared to Q1 of last year, these results were primarily driven by reduced pressure pumping services in U.S. land. Partially offset by higher activity in international markets. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q1 was $2.4 billion, an increase of 7% compared to Q1 2023. Operating income was $398 million, up 8%, and operating margin was 16%, an increase of 10 basis points over Q1 last year. These results were primarily driven by higher drilling-related services in the Middle East and North America as well as improvements across multiple product lines in Latin America. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q1 international revenue increased 12% year over year. Europe/Africa revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $729 million, an increase of 10% year over year. This increase was primarily driven by higher completion tool sales in the region and fluid services in Norway and the Caspian area. Middle East/Asia revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $1.4 million, an increase of 6% year over year. This increase was primarily related to improved activity in multiple product service lines in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Oman. Latin America revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $1.1 billion, an increase of 21% year over year. This improvement was primarily related to higher drilling-related services and increased software sales in Mexico, improved pressure pumping service and fluid services in Argentina, and increased activity in multi-product service lines in Brazil and Ecuador. In North America, revenue was $2.5 billion, representing an 8% decrease year over year, but a 5% increase from the last quarter. This year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower pressure pumping services in U.S. land as well as lower wireline activity. Moving on to other items, in Q1, our corporate and other expense was $65 million. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect our corporate expenses to be approximately flat. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and is on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q1, we spent $34 million, or about $0.04 per diluted share, on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For the second quarter, we expect SAP expenses to be approximately flat. Net interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. For the second quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly flat. Other net expense for Q1 was $108 million, higher than expected, primarily due to impairment of an investment in Argentina and currency devaluation in Egypt. For the second quarter 2024, we expect this expense to be approximately $35 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for Q1 was 21.5%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter 2024 effective tax rate to increase approximately 75 basis points. Capital expenditures for Q1 were $330 million. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to remain approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q1 cash flow from operations was $487 million, and free cash flow was $206 million. During the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of our common stock. For the full year 2024, we expect free cash flow to be at least 10% higher than 2023. Now let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the second quarter. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be up 2% to 4% and margins to increase by 25 to 75 basis points. In our drilling and evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to increase 1% to 3% and margins to increase by 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.
Jeffrey Miller: Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton delivered solid first quarter results. I am confident in the strength and duration of this up cycle. We expect our North America business to deliver flattish revenues and margins year-on-year despite lower activity levels. We also expect our international business revenue to grow at low double digits year-on-year. I'm excited about the outlook for Halliburton and expect Halliburton to deliver strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. And now let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question, and it comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Please proceed.
David Anderson: Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. I want to ask you about a couple of things that you talked about in your prepared remarks. And the first is on the ZEUS fleet. You had an impressive 5% sequential increase in North America this quarter, despite the flat rate count. I have to think it's probably attributed to these e-fleets being rolled out. It's pretty clear, this is a big step change in efficiency for your customer, and demand seems to be exceeding supply at least for the next couple of years, but I guess, the question is what prevents the industry from building out? And can you talk about your competitive advantage today and how you maintain that? You were first to market, establish leadership, but is there differentiated technology? Is it more about relationships? I guess, the question is really on the moat on this business as you see it over the next few years.
Jeffrey Miller: Yes. Thank you, Dave. Look, the most important point is this is a comprehensive platform. ZEUS is a platform. Clearly, it's electric. Yes, it drives efficiency, but the embedded automation actually really changes the dynamics of how it performs. And then, also the subsurface measurements with Sensory that are embedded in this system, and uniquely embedded. And so, that widens the moat. And I think equally important is being at scale. So, it's one thing to do a research project around a thing, but when we're working at scale, these are solutions that can be pushed to the platform at any point in time. So, it's really the ability to grow the moat on existing equipment as well as any new turns on the science as it goes forward. So, I'm super excited about it. Yes, obviously lowest TCO, but it's the technology differentiation as well that widens the moat.
David Anderson: And then, just to touch on something else, you had talked about some unconventional fields in international markets. Clearly, one of the big stories this year has been the Saudi shift in CapEx from offshore towards those unconventionals, specifically around Jafurah. You have a toehold in that field with that liquid mud plant facility, but this is just starting development. My understanding is there's a bunch of tenders on the way more coming. Can you talk about sort of the opportunity set for Halliburton on this field in the near-term, maybe incremental growth you see in '25? And how do you support these build-outs? You said capacity is really tight in the market. Is this a market maybe you bring some diesel fleets in there? Is there other equipment in the region, or how do you think about that, the tightness and the capacity as it relates to building out to some conventional field?
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you, David. And I'm really excited about it. And there's a lot of opportunity for Halliburton around unconventionals, as you know. How we address it, we've got a lot of ways to address it, including some of the technology we've talked about today. We've got a good position in there, but I think with even more opportunity to grow, particularly with drilling technology that continues to advance. You mentioned mud, but also other aspects of that where we'll be very competitive. So, I think that's a big move forward. And I think more broadly, so good for Halliburton, but I think that more broadly, just the discussion around unconventionals internationally, what can you see today are two markets, at least outside the U.S., that are truly at scale. And I think that serves as a bit of a template for how that can be done, because it was really unclear a decade ago, as you recall. But I think we're in a different place with unconventionals today. And so, we do hear more discussion around, hey, this is possible, and how Halliburton would play a more meaningful role in that in additional markets, so super encouraged.
David Anderson: Thank you, Jeff.
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. One moment, it comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Neil Mehta: Good morning, Jeff, and team. Jeff, you've talked about wanting to drive your free cash flow per share higher. And so, it's great to see the share repurchases for a couple quarters run rating at this $250 million mark. Can you talk about why you think that's the right number to use going forward? And how does share repurchase fit in the seriatim of capital allocation?
Eric Carre: Yes, Neil, it's Eric. So, the baseline that we use is the framework that we announced several quarters ago to return a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. We actually returned over that at just about 60% in 2023. So, when we look at the improvements in free cash flow year-over-year, which we mentioned to be about 10%. So, when we think through that, we think that the $250 million of buyback is a good base load for us to be repurchasing shares. So, expect more buybacks in dollars, expect more overall returns to shareholder dollar-wise, and then, we see where the overall percentage lands, but it should be pretty close to what we did last year. Yes.
Neil Mehta: Okay. That's really helpful. And then, the follow-up is, we are seeing signs of industry consolidation, certainly more in E&P and services, but we start to see some in services as well. Halliburton always struck us as more of a organically driven business, but be curious on how you're thinking about M&A as you plan to go forward for the business?
Jeffrey Miller: Look, Neil, no change to our strategy. You're correct. We like bolt-on M&A technology acquisitions. We think about M&A in terms really of research and development. Is it something that advances research? Does it move it more quickly so that we get to market more quickly? But we see significant organic growth in the businesses that we're in. And so, we like where we are and we see plenty of growth. And we also, I believe that organic growth generates more value for shareholders. And we've seen that with other things that we've done in the past in terms of small acquisitions that we're able to then grow and push through our channel. But we like the space where we compete and we like the technology and how we develop that. And so, you shouldn't expect any change from Halliburton.
Neil Mehta: All right. Thanks, team.
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan Securities. Please proceed.
Arun Jayaram: Yes. Good morning, Jeff. I wanted to see if you could characterize your thoughts on the future prospects of the OpEx versus the D&C cycle on a go forward basis. Can you talk about your current leverage to OpEx and production? And is this an area strategically you'd like to grow either organically or inorganically over time?
Jeffrey Miller: Yes. Well, I want to answer the second part of that first in terms of organically. Yes. So, we don't see a change to our strategy or approach to markets. So, yes, we do see quite a bit of organic growth for us in the OpEx part of the market. We're in that business today. We've got strong, I mean, strong lift business today. We're in the chemicals business today. And we're in the intervention business today in a pretty big way. And we continue to develop technology similar to as we've done in the past. And so, it's my outlook for OpEx cycle. We've got plenty of exposure to that and have had. Now, I want to be careful and say the D&C cycle is very strong and continues to grow. And I suspect that it continues to grow also. So, I think we're well balanced across really all elements of this, whether it's exploration, development, drilling, and OpEx today. Some of the things we've done in the past, again, we bought smaller businesses that we've grown into bigger businesses. And so, again, a strategy that works for us and it delivers the organic growth that we believe is really good for our shareholders.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Jeff, second question is, I wanted to see if you could give us your perspective on any potential impact to how from the changing mix of activity in Saudi Arabia, which looks to be a little bit more onshore versus shallow water. And maybe you could just talk about the year over growth in MENA, which at 6% seemed a little bit lower than we were expecting.
Jeffrey Miller: Well, I think the first part of that in terms of Saudi growth, '24 is still growing, by the way. We expect growth in Saudi in '24. And the rebalancing, the gas and unconventionals is very good for Halliburton. We've got a very strong onshore business in Saudi Arabia. We participate in all aspects of that market. And that market remains tight for equipment. So, I feel good about that market. And I'm very confident in the long-term growth of that market. The rebalancing again to gas is, we're meaningful players in that part of the market and expect that will only be good for Halliburton. Pivot to growth, look, a couple of things. Number one, international business grew 12% overall. So, I want to start there. Clearly, I'd expect more growth in the region, but here's what we're doing. I want to be really clear that profitable growth has been our primary focus. We see a good pipeline of opportunities. We expect to continue to see growth in MENA. But at the same time, we want to make certain we're building a foundation shipment for growth. That means that we are delivering the technology, we're making the investment while expanding margins and growing, and that's been sort of our mantra, our strategy is profitable international growth. And that's what we saw this quarter.
Arun Jayaram: Thanks, Jeff.
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Roger Read: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Jeff, I'd like to get back in on the international growth. So, double digits, what you've delivered, double digits, where you're guiding or where you're headed. How much of this would you describe as due to new products or products and services or new markets and how much of it to just underlying expansion? Why don't you get kind of an -- you've talked about a lot of the new stuff you're putting in, just how effective that is in driving some of this growth?
Jeffrey Miller: Yes, thanks. Look, I think the growth is broad based, but the technology matters. It's not necessarily new products. It's actually an expanding market. A couple of things are happening at one time, yes, activity is growing, but we're participating in a larger share of that growth than maybe in the past based on some of the technology I described. So, we're competing differently technically, and so we get a bigger part of that growth. We've added some new things, yes, like Lift internationally, that's a new product for growth, a new product that's a whole business, but it's growth end markets, and we're really pleased with the progress that that's making. And then, obviously, pricing in the tight market internationally helps us well because that's helping growth all around. But I would not overlook the importance of the improvement in drilling technology, particularly just because it's more access to a larger market and at a much better rate of return for us given the improvement over legacy technology. The capital efficiency of the new technology is probably is right about 40% more capital efficient than the legacy tools. So, getting sort of improvement along several dimensions there, growing market, bigger share, better pricing and better capital efficiency.
Roger Read: Thanks for that. And then, just to pivot back real quick to North America, you mentioned not really anticipating or certainly not built into the expectations for recovery in gas this year. Presuming that that's kind of a well completions way you're thinking about it, at what point of the year would you have to see an increase maybe in activity spending rig count in gas to think that there was a chance that you could outperform I say you, but the market could outperform your expectation. Like if we get to the third quarter and we haven't seen an improvement, we should close the books on '24 having any improvements to dig about '25?
Jeffrey Miller: Yes, look thanks. I think that's the next big leg of growth in North America. It's a question of timing, but it is no question going to drive a lot of growth in North America. And I expect it will drive market growth '25 and beyond. And I think what's overlooked, look through the current timing and look forward to what's coming, attrition has really shrunk the fleet. The fleet for the market is shrinking to meet the demand that is there today and that happens every day. Equipment is not being built, new equipment. So, when we get to that point in time, it will be an incredibly tight market. And so, I'm actually quite excited and confident about what gas means to the North America market. Just saying, yes, the leading indicators of that will be well construction, it will be offtake contracts for LNG. There will be a number of things that sort of happen, but it will happen just given the capital has been invested on the export side. There's no question that the gas will be developed to meet that.
Roger Read: Great.
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it's from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.
James West: Hey, good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Eric.
Jeffrey Miller: Good morning, James.
Eric Carre: Good morning, James.
James West: So, Jeff, one of the areas that we haven't discussed in detail yet in the Q&A is really deepwater where you guys have an advantage position this cycle, I think relative to prior cycles even though you've been strong there for a while. But the technology enhancements that have happened at Halliburton puts you in a unique position to have more share, better profitability. And I'm curious kind of where you're seeing right now the biggest growth? And I think we know kind of Brazil and some other places, but where do you think we're going to be surprised as we go into kind of probably '25 and '26?
Jeffrey Miller: Look, I think the surprise will be West Africa and North Sea in terms of '25 and beyond. I think really we're planning work now. There are great opportunities today that are being planned by clients with the full expectation that we see a meaningful step up as we go into '25 and beyond. And these are all long-term type projects that will extend into the end of the decade. So, but I do think that's where we'll see a lot of activity.
James West: Okay. Okay. That makes sense. And then, maybe just back to North America to pivot back there. Again, I don't want to beat a dead horse, but you guys are dramatically outperforming some of the peers in North America. And where do you hold the line, I guess on kind of pricing? And where do you sacrifice utilization in a market that may be down a little bit? Is it -- we just we'll give up the utilization to keep our pricing, or do you -- are you willing to give some discount to keep utilization high?
Jeffrey Miller: Yes. Look, James, do we see some pressure? Yes. But does that affect our strategy? Absolutely not. We've got a strategy with maximized value in North America. 40% of our equipment is contracted under long-term contracts, and we're not terribly exposed where we do see that pressure. And I think maybe more answer than you want, but I think it's important that we keep central as our strategy is delivering unique technologies that create real value for customers. And so, that's what lowest TCO looks like and that's why we're also work solving for recovery with ZEUS platform and Sensory. We think those two things alone create significant value for customers and so we keep that central.
James West: Right, right. Totally get it. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you, James.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please proceed.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning.
Jeffrey Miller: Good morning, Scott.
Eric Carre: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Gruber: Well, it's getting later in the call, so I'll give you a chance to mention AI a few times. Not that it's needed. But are global customers starting to discuss additional demands from power for data centers? And do you think this has the potential to pull forward additional gas developments over the next few years around the world? Or is this still off the horizon?
Jeffrey Miller: I think gas is a critical fuel. And look, yes, I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that the growth in demand for gas or gas and electricity and that being the most effective way to deliver power certainly today in the most reliable. So, I think that this is almost becoming, it's one of those things that you don't see it until it's on top of you. And I think that right now that demand is on top of us. And so, I think that can only be additive to demand. I have no question that will be additive. And clearly, AI consumes more power than traditional data centers. So, I think all of that combined, there's almost it's not almost, it is a secular trend towards demanding more power and that can only be good for our industry and for Halliburton.
Scott Gruber: Yes, it'll be interesting to watch. Just turning back to the near-term, Latin America was a big outperformer versus our expectation. Can you just provide some more color on the details of what drove the outperformance in Latin America? And overall, what type of growth would you anticipate from the market this year?
Jeffrey Miller: Look, Latin America performed very well. It's broad based growth in Latin America. So, really it's several geographies and types of markets, whether Argentina, Mexico, Caribbean, Ecuador. So, we saw strong growth all over. And important to say, our team in Latin America is doing an exceptional job. I'm very appreciative and pleased with the work that team does. And I think it also demonstrates how oil and gas is critical to economies. Those are economies that require oil and gas. They view oil and gas as critical to both security and economic growth, things that are important in Latin America. And so, I expect there's more to come.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate it, Jeff. Thank you.
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.
Luke Lemoine: Hey, good morning. Jeff, you've reiterated your full-year international revs up low-double-digits with margins expanding this year. But could you maybe talk more specifically about how you see the D&E margins unfolding on a full-year basis? And then also, as we kind of look over the next couple of years as international continues to unfold, you roll out new products and services like iStar and iCruise, what are kind of the aspirational targets here in D&E?
Jeffrey Miller: Yes. Look, I like the trajectory that we're seeing in D&E. And I say that because we're growing the business, but we're growing the business at a pace that's profitable and building the kind of foundation that we can use the technology in markets where we know we've got solid growth and profitability and then be able to reach out from there. But clearly, it is a balance of growing margins while opening for example, new businesses. So, we've opened a few new markets while growing profitably. And I think that's sort of the foundational part of our D&E trajectory. So, I expect to continue to see it aspirationally, continue to expect it to go up and expand quarter-over-quarter, year-on-year. And in the first quarter, we actually saw flooding in some markets. We saw weather in some others, maybe more than we would have expected. Though I expect that we continue on the trajectory in spite of all of the things that sort of come along and businesses that are open. So, should expect to continue to see that moving up.
Luke Lemoine: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thanks. And one moment for our next question. And it comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Please proceed.
Stephen Gengaro: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
Jeffrey Miller: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Gengaro: Two from me, the first, you mentioned the strength in iCruise in North America. I think you said more than double a year ago footage drilled. Is that displacing competitors? Is that organic growth? Is that replacing all technology that you're offering? Can you give some color around that?
Jeffrey Miller: Look, it's performing very well and the uptake has been strong. And so, it is different technology than what we've ever had in the past. It's designed for this market. It's built on the iCruise platform. So, how it gets to market is really customer driven and there's been just more uptake on the technology self. Yes, it's all organic. In terms of it, we developed the technology ourselves. We've worked on it for some time. We built a platform that has been very effective internationally and now we've gotten to the North America part of it. So, it's early days, but stay tuned. I mean, we're really pleased with the advancement that it's making, but it's really customers will drive the uptake for that. So, the increase in footage drilled is indicative of customers gaining confidence in the performance of that technology, particularly in the curved lateral.
Stephen Gengaro: Great. Thank you. And I know this may be a little harder for you to answer directly, but when we think about the CHX, SLV deal and what's going on in production chemicals, I would imagine it's an area that would have interest to you. But my question is really, you had a great amount of success with Summit and what you bought and built over the last, I guess five, six years plus and the strength of that business. Is that something that you can replicate in production chemicals if you went down that road?
Jeffrey Miller: Look, I think, I'll revert back to strategically we like to grow things organically. We own the kernel of a business there. We continue to make progress. We've got the plant. The capacity is filling up in the Middle East. So, the trade-off is speed, but I think also the trade-off from our perspective anyway has been, we know how to do this and we believe it generates a lot of value for our shareholders when we go about it this way. And so, we're going to continue to grow our chemicals business around the world on the back of some assets that we built ourselves. And so, I'm pleased, I think there's opportunities for organic growth in chemicals, organic growth, and strong growth in intervention, a whole lot of different areas.
Stephen Gengaro: Okay, great. Now, thank you for the call.
Jeffrey Miller: Yes. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, and it comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please proceed.
Marc Bianchi: Hi. I wanted to circle back to the discussion on pricing for North America just because you made the comment that you've seen some softening, but you're not changing your strategy. Could you just comment on how sort of the market has evolved over the last 90 days, if anything has changed. We've had a competitor out there saying that they're going to go after share at the expensive price.
Jeffrey Miller: Look, I don't comment on competitors, but from a strategic perspective we haven't changed. What we're doing and I like where we are. A big part of our fleet is contracted today. We focus on delivering top-notch efficiency, sort of record-setting efficiency, and also lowest ECO. And so, that's where our primary focus is, and we plan to stay with that.
Marc Bianchi: Okay, great. Thanks for that, Jeff. And then, on the second quarter outlook, you gave the C&P and D&E, should we assume that that's a similar profile for international in North America or anything that we should be contemplating there?
Jeffrey Miller: In terms of -- I don't --
Marc Bianchi: Yes. Go ahead Jeff.
Jeffrey Miller: Look, in terms of growth, I think the margin growth I expect will continue. I mean, I think that we talked about expanding margins and D&E and also C&P is continuing to grow. And I think we're solid. We're in a number of very good businesses around C&P.
Marc Bianchi: Okay. Maybe just to clarify, the question was more on revenue, so I guess what I'm wondering is to get to the low double digits for international, it would seem that you need a pretty healthy growth in the remaining -- all three remaining quarters of the year sequentially.
Jeffrey Miller: Oh, yes, sorry, I --
Marc Bianchi: Could you talk about where that's coming from?
Jeffrey Miller: Yes. So, that's pretty broad-based. I mean, and so for C&P that's completion tools around the world. It's production enhancement around the world. So, in a very strong position, and we see a number of things growing, not the least of which would be lift, for example, and some things like that. So, I had heavy lift, I don't see it as a -- I see it as a very middle of the fairway, very doable from where we sit today. And again, equipment's tight. I think that we'll continue to see strengthening there as well, expanding margins in price.
Marc Bianchi: Very good. Thank you.
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, and it comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please proceed.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for slotting me in here. So, Jeff you've been at this a long time. You referenced on more than one occasion, not just today, but in other calls about increasing level of visibility, especially on the international front and talking about opportunities that could extend out to the end of the decade. I think a lot of investors are wanting to kind of get inside the room with you, if you will, and try to get the same sort of conviction you have with respect to that duration. So, I'm just kind of curious if you could give us some perspectives and insights on how those conversations are taking place, how much lead time your customers are asking for, and effectively, what two or three things are you seeing that continue to underpin this confidence and conviction that this cycle is going to extend through the end of the decade?
Jeffrey Miller: Yes, thanks. Look, some of its work that will begin in '25 that is planned to go through the end of the decade. So, I feel very confident about that. Others are work that we're working on planning with clients that again are the types of projects that extend that far. I think just the price of the commodity and the tightness and the rising demand for oil and gas gives me confidence and it gives our clients confidence. And clearly, we've seen a bit of a return to oil and gas and its importance in a lot of places, but the type of work that we're starting, the type of offshore work that we're starting is takes time to get started and it takes a long time to do, and so, very confident about that broadly. And I would include, anyway, the outlook for North America is similar in terms of duration. I mean, this is the kind of investments that we've seen in North America that are not for a quarter or two. These are decade-long investments that we've seen happen. And the next leg on gas and the demand for gas, it's already been talked about on this call. I feel very confident in the resilience of this cycle.
Kurt Hallead: That's great. I appreciate that. So, the other dynamic you referenced was approving margins, right? So, you've booked contracts that tend to last, I don't know, two to three years on average in the international market, so those will roll through this year and next year and so on. Just curious in the context of that margin improvement from here, right, if you were to try to rank and order it. Is how much of the pricing how much is it? Is it volume? How much is the technology value proposition? Can you give us some additional sense on how you see that? What's driving that margin improvement?
Jeffrey Miller: Look, I think it's a combination of those. Some of it is certainly tightness in the market and pricing, but at the same time we've talked about our R&D investment over the last eight years has all been directed at better capital efficiency, and that drives margin also. That drives margins in our drilling business, it drives margin in our frac business. But these are deliberate choices that we've made to drive down or to improve capital efficiency and return. And I think that's evident, probably most evident in our drilling technology and our ZEUS technology. But at the same time, that's been a practice in all of our business. And so, anything that we're producing today, sort of its first criteria has to be improved capital efficiency and better returns out of R&D. And so, I'm really pleased with the success we've had there. And so, I would say all are contributing today, in addition to having sort of more market access, more opportunity to compete on the back of improved technology.
Kurt Hallead: I appreciate that. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, and it comes from the line of Doug Becker with Capital One. Please proceed.
Douglas Becker: Thanks. Jeff, would you expand a little bit more on the drivers behind the sequential margin expansion in D&E? And really, the question is just a function that the last several years D&E margins actually declined in 2Q from 1Q.
Jeffrey Miller: Look, I think that's, again, I'm back to the foundation building that I described. So, we've got a better foundation, broader-based work, and so I expect to continue to see expansion, certainly year-over-year. And then, also as that foundation gets stronger, that gives us more ability to grow the business profitably, but from a sound base.
Eric Carre: I think Doug, it's Eric here, that the typical drop in margin in Q2 happens with the reduction in our software business. The way we recognize revenue in our software business means that it's essentially taken in Q4 and in Q1, so we see a bit of a drop there. You see that being more muted this year because, as Jeff mentioned, the D&E margins were softer than we were expecting in Q1, as we had much more significant weather issues in the North Sea in Norway, in Alaska, and then the flooding over in Indonesia. So, the combination of the muted effect and the more traditional software impact moving from Q1 to Q2 results in margins going up here.
Douglas Becker: That all makes sense. Maybe switching to North America, U.S. more specifically, last quarter you were talking about ZEUS e-fleets would represent about 40% by the end of the year, going to maybe 50% in 2025. Is there a reasonable or realistic or probable scenario where you would accelerate this deployment? The results certainly suggest the outperformance and there might be a case for that.
Jeffrey Miller: No. Look, this is a market push. The whole strategy behind e-fleet for us has been build the best technologies and clients demand it, and we've built to the demand that we see in hand, and therefore, they are not built on spec, they are built for customers that plan to use them. And we don't plan to change that. And so, in some ways that adds central to maximizing value in North America. When we maximize value in North America, we are not going to build things, we don't have home. And so, I expect to continue to see market demand for this equipment. 2024 is actually already in hand. It's just delivering the units themselves. They already have homes. And in '25, we actually have some deliveries. And I expect that we will see more as we go forward. But I think that important to remember that that our approach is to build to contract.
Douglas Becker: That makes sense. Thank you.
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you.
Eric Carre: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And with that, we conclude our Q-and-A session for today. I will pass it back to management for final comments.
Jeffrey Miller: Okay. Thank you, Carmen. Let me close out the call with this, I am excited about the outlook for Halliburton and expect Halliburton to deliver strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Let's close out the call.
Operator: Thank you everyone for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-01-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Halliburton Company Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
David Coleman: Hello and thank you for joining the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available for 7 days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter earnings release and in the Quarterly Results & Presentation section of our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a great year for Halliburton. Both of our divisions achieved their highest operating margins in over a decade, and we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders. Here are the highlights. We delivered full year total company revenue of $23 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year; and operating income of $4.1 billion, an increase of 33% compared to 2022 adjusted operating income. Our international business demonstrated strong growth with our revenue up 17% year-over-year despite our exit from Russia in August of 2022, completing 2 consecutive years of high teens growth. Our North America business showed strength with revenue up 9% year-over-year despite rig count declines. Completion and Production revenue grew 18% year-over-year and margins expanded 312 basis points. Drilling and Evaluation grew 7% year-over-year and margins expanded 171 basis points. Turning now to Q4, where Halliburton delivered exceptional margin performance supported by better-than-anticipated completion tool sales globally, strong performance across multiple high-margin product lines and favorable weather in North America. Completion and Production margins finished the year almost 100 basis points higher than Q4 of 2022. International revenue grew 12% year-over-year, led by the Europe-Africa region, which grew revenue 17%. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash from operations, $1.1 billion of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $250 million of common stock and $150 million of debt. Before we continue, I want to take a moment and thank the Halliburton employees around the world who made these results possible. Our success last quarter and throughout 2023 was a direct result of your hard work and dedication. Thank you for your relentless focus on safety, operational execution, customer collaboration and service quality performance. Let me begin with my views on the strength of the oilfield services market. As we look past the new cycle and near-term commodity price volatility, the fundamentals for oilfield services remain strong. Here are 2 reasons why. First, we see an increase in service intensity everywhere we operate. Whether it's longer laterals in North America, smaller and more complex reservoirs in mature fields or offshore deepwater, customers require more services to develop their resources, not fewer. Second, long-term expansion of the global economy will continue to create enormous demands on all forms of energy. I expect oil and gas remains a critical component of the global energy mix with demand growth well into the future. With this positive macro outlook, I believe Halliburton's strong execution, leading technology and collaborative approach will drive demand for Halliburton's products and services around the world. Now let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's performance delivered another year of profitable growth. Halliburton's full year international revenue grew 17% year-on-year, and our quarterly revenue grew 12% compared to the same quarter of last year. Each region delivered year-on-year revenue growth throughout 2023, and both divisions delivered improved international margins year-on-year. Our results in 2023 demonstrate the effectiveness of Halliburton's profitable international growth strategy, the strength of our global competitiveness across product lines and the power of our value proposition with customers. In 2024, we expect international E&P spending to grow at a low double-digit pace and foresee multiple years of sustained activity growth. Although we anticipate regional differences in growth rates for 2024, we believe the Middle East/Asia region will likely experience the greatest increases in activity with other regions closely behind. As we look out to 2025, we expect Africa and Europe, among others, to demonstrate above-average growth. Beyond 2025, we see an active tender pipeline with work scopes extending through the end of the decade, which gives me confidence in the duration of this multiyear upcycle. While we expect overall activity growth, we also see above-market growth within our well construction product lines, where customers choose Halliburton to improve the reliability, consistency and efficiency of their drilling operations. One such technology is LOGIX' autonomous drilling platform, which is now used on 90% of our iCruise runs worldwide. Customers also rely on Halliburton's subsurface expertise to develop today's most complex reservoirs. This requires technologies to reduce uncertainties, such as our DecisionSpace 365, unified ensemble modeling and advanced formation evaluation systems like our iStar logging well drilling platform, and reservoir Xaminer formation testing service. These technologies enable customers to target small reservoirs, identify bypassed reserves and gather reservoir properties in real time. We see reservoir complexity increasing worldwide, and I expect the capabilities of these systems will continue to deliver customer value and lead in overall growth within our formation evaluation portfolio. For Completion and Production, we also expect increased adoption of our technologies like intelligent completions, multilateral solutions and artificial lift. Our intelligent and multilateral completions enable customers to produce, inject and control multiple zones in a wellbore, which is critical for offshore developments, a segment we expect to outpace the overall market. In artificial lift, our strategy targets markets like the Middle East and Latin America, where our differentiated performance and existing footprint create a solid foundation for profitable growth. We also expect strong demand for our services in carbon capture and storage, where Halliburton's leading capabilities to design, deliver and validate reliable barriers play a crucial role. As our customers invest in carbon storage, our tailored cement designs and casing equipment technology enable them to address the unique challenges of long-term carbon sequestration. With this activity growth, the availability of equipment and experienced personnel remains tight. We expect asset-intensive offshore activity to increase, which will further tighten the market. As offshore represents over half of our business outside North America land, we expect this activity to drive improved pricing and higher margins for our business. I am confident in Halliburton's strategy for profitable international growth, and I am excited about our performance in 2024 and well into the future. Turning to North America. Halliburton's strategy yielded strong results in 2023. Our full year North America revenue of $10.5 billion was a 9% increase when compared to 2022 despite sequentially lower rig count. Fourth quarter margins in North America land were relatively flat quarter-over-quarter despite lower revenue. Our full year and fourth quarter results demonstrated the strength of our differentiated business and the successful execution of our strategy to maximize value. The dynamic North America market continues to evolve with larger customers and stable programs, elevated quality expectations and greater demand for technology to improve recovery and well productivity. This evolution fits perfectly with Halliburton's value proposition. Our Zeus electric fracturing solution is highly sought after in this market, where its seamless combination of electric frac, automation and real-time subsurface measurements uniquely address customer requirements. We believe customers demand Zeus because it provides the lowest total cost of ownership and it's shown to be the most proven and reliable solution in the market. The market pull for this technology has been strong. The combination of Zeus fleets working in the field today and Zeus fleets contracted for 2024 delivery represent over 40% of our fracturing fleet. I expect well over half of our fleets will be electric in 2025 with all of these e-fleets on multiyear contracts generating full return of and return on capital during their initial contract terms. Consistent with our strategy from the beginning, we plan for our Zeus deliveries in 2024 to replace existing fleets rather than add incremental fleet capacity. This is how we maximize value in North America. The growth of Zeus and our commercial approach has transformed the North America completion services market. Technology is only transformative when adopted and is only adopted at the rate of Zeus when it works and creates meaningful value for our customers. Zeus' rapid adoption, both by new and repeat customers, tells us our solution is the right one for North America. Turning to our 2024 North America outlook. We expect a continued strong business with the combination of stable levels of activity in the market and the contracted nature of Halliburton's portfolio. We expect this results in a flattish revenue and margin environment for Halliburton. To close out, I am confident in our strategies to maximize value in North America and for profitable growth internationally. In 2023, Halliburton demonstrated the power of these strategies, the consistency of our execution and the value of our differentiated technology. We generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow during the year, retired approximately $300 million of debt and returned $1.4 billion of cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends, which represents over 60% of our free cash flow. Today, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved an increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share. Our outlook for oilfield services remains strong, and I expect we will deepen and strengthen our value proposition and generate significant free cash flow. Now I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?
Eric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. 2023 was a strong year for Halliburton. Multiple financial and operational metrics showed the best business performance in recent memory, any one of which are worthy of highlighting. More important than any single metric, however, the overall business performance demonstrated the effectiveness of our strategy. Here are a few highlights. In our C&P division, our 2023 margins of 20.7% were the highest since 2011. In our D&E division, 2023 margins of 16.5% were the highest since 2008. In North America, our strategy to maximize value is about structurally changing the risk and return profile of our business. We delivered steady margins through the year despite lower activity driven by the rollout of our Zeus fleet and their associated contract terms and the strength of our well construction business. Internationally, our profitable growth strategy drove revenue and margin improvement across all of our geographies. Revenue was the highest in the last 8 years, and profit margins were the highest in over a decade. Beyond pricing and activity, this is the result of the multiyear investment in our drilling business and technology differentiation across multiple product lines. Our focus on capital efficiency allowed this revenue growth and structural margin improvement, while capital spending remained within our target range of 5% to 6% of revenue. Collectively, these results generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow, the highest cash generation in the last 15 years. Let's turn now to our fourth quarter results. Our Q4 reported net income per diluted share was $0.74. Net income per diluted share, adjusted for losses in Argentina primarily due to the currency devaluation, was $0.86. Total company revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.7 billion. Operating income was $1.1 billion and the operating margin was 18.4%, a 95 basis point increase over Q4 2022. Beginning with our Completion and Production division. Revenue in Q4 was $3.3 billion, operating income was $716 million, and the operating income margin was 22%. Our better-than-anticipated results were driven by the best fourth quarter of completion tool sales in 9 years, strong performance across multiple product lines and favorable weather in North America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in Q4 was $2.4 billion, operating income was $420 million, and the operating income margin was 17%, an increase of 122 basis point over Q4 last year. These results were in line with our expectation and driven by international software sales, higher project management activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and increased fluid services in the Western Hemisphere. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q4 international revenue increased 4% sequentially, which was our highest international revenue quarter since 2015 and tenth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth. Q4 sequential growth was led by the Middle East region driven by improved activity across multiple product lines and strong year-end completion tool sales. Europe/Africa demonstrated sequential growth consistent with the overall international market with higher activity in Africa offsetting lower product sales in Europe. Latin America revenue declined slightly in the fourth quarter, where reduced completion-related activity following a very strong third quarter activity improvements in the Caribbean. In North America, revenue in Q4 decreased 7% sequentially driven primarily by a decline in U.S. land activity as a result of typical holiday-related slowdowns. However, we experienced fewer weather-related events than expected. As weather-related downtime is more expensive than planned downtime, this means our Q4 North America land margins were higher than anticipated. Additionally, completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico delivered the strongest quarter in 3 years. Moving on to other items. In Q4, our corporate and other expense was $63 million. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect corporate expenses to be flat. Our SAP deployment remains on budget and on schedule to conclude in 2025. In Q4, we spent $15 million or about $0.02 per diluted share on SAP S/4 migration, which is included in our results. For the first quarter 2024, we expect these expenses to be approximately $30 million or $0.03 per share due to the timing associated with accelerated phases of the rollout. In 2024, we expect to spend $120 million and $80 million in 2025. Net interest expense for the quarter was $98 million, slightly higher than expected primarily due to premiums associated with debt buybacks. For the first quarter 2024, we expect net interest expense to be roughly $85 million. Other net expense for Q4 was $16 million lower than our prior guidance due to the non-GAAP treatment of the Argentinian peso devaluation. For the first quarter 2024, we expect this expense to be about $35 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for Q4 was 17.9%, lower than expected due to discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our first quarter 2024 effective tax rate to be approximately 21%, slightly lower than our anticipated full year effective tax rate. Capital expenditure for Q4 were $399 million, which brought our full year CapEx total to $1.4 billion. Approximately 60% of our CapEx was deployed to international and offshore markets in 2023, and we expect this ratio to remain similar in 2024. For the full year of 2024, we expect capital expenditures to remain approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q4 cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion and free cash flow was $1.1 billion, bringing our full year free cash flow to about $2.3 billion. For 2024, we expect free cash flow to be directionally higher. Now let me provide you with some comments on our expectations for the first quarter. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of significant year-end product sales. As a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be flat to down 2% and margins lower by 125 to 175 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to decline between 1% to 3% and margins to be lower by 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.
Jeffrey Miller: Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. 2023 was a great year for Halliburton. We generated about $2.3 billion of free cash flow and returned over 60% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We're committed to return over 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2024. For our international business, we expect low double-digit growth driven by the power of our value proposition, global competitiveness across all product lines and our profitable growth strategy. In North America, we expect a continued strong business driven by stable activity, our differentiated technical position with our Zeus electric frac solution and the increasingly contracted nature of our business. And now let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. First question comes from David Anderson with Barclays.
David Anderson: So a question on the C&P margins that held flat during the quarter, and you said U.S. land was holding flat. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the influence of your growing e-frac fleet on the bottom line. We know the operational advantages, but I was wondering if you could talk about how it impacts financially. How does e-frac, say -- compared to, say, your Tier 4 dual fuel, the diesel fleets just in terms of pricing and operating costs, trying to get a sense of how accretive the new equipment is. And sort of secondarily on that, with E&P consolidation well underway and we look out, say, 12 to 24 months, would you expect the majority of your e-frac fleets to be with these larger operators under multiyear contracts?
Jeffrey Miller: Yes. Well, thanks, Dave. Look, e-fleets are accretive. They're accretive for a couple of reasons. Number one, highly efficient to operate from our standpoint. And so that makes them more accretive. Clearly, the are bringing a lot of value to clients, and therefore, they're priced and thought about differently in the marketplace. And so look, I expect that, that will continue into the future. But I think what's most important is the contracted nature of the fleets, which mean a couple of things also. Number one, that the pricing is sticky, but it's sticky because it's contracted over time and the value is thought about. And so sophisticated procurers can look at that and model that, and we can model it as well and comfortable with the value created. But I think the second thing, as we think about what types of customers look at e-fleets, these aren't a spot market solution. I mean the companies that are interested in e-fleets are those that have steady programs, work through cycles, have a clear vision of where their business needs to go and are willing to commit to the technology to deliver that over the long term. And so -- and really, it's an entire system. If we think about an electric fleet, it's -- obviously, it's an efficient, lowest-TCO electric solution, but it's also automated, which drives the level of precision around fracking that I've never seen before. And so the clients know that they're delivering what they expect to deliver, and then finally, the subsurface measurement. But I bring all of that up because that's part of what drives it being accretive: a, it creates a lot more value, therefore, is more accretive than a Tier 4 diesel fleet clearly; and then also a different set of conditions, which also changes the return profile of these assets as we go into the market. I hope that helps, Dave.
David Anderson: It does. A clear differentiation there. So a separate question here. I noticed in your release, you announced 2 new collaborations with other service companies: one in reservoir analysis, the other MPD. It sort of effectively fills a few of your weaker spots of your portfolio. And if I just think back to last cycle, we saw a number of acquisitions, but I don't recall too many collaborations out there. I mean, on the one hand -- I guess, from my point of view, on the one hand, maybe you're testing the waters a bit, but on the other, it seems like it's a pretty good way to fill product lines without spending a lot of capital. I was wondering if you could talk about the strategy and why it's different during the current cycle. And would you expect to enter more collaborations in the coming years?
Jeffrey Miller: Well, look, I think it's more a function of the technology that we have and when we see -- we've developed some things around digital cores and the ability to evaluate them digitally, for example, but trying to buy our way into the entire core space. We'd rather partner with who we think the premier core analysis company is. And so we're able to bring our technology to that. And effectively, it's a complementary strategy where we make better returns doing the things that we've developed and know how to do. And obviously, we believe Core Labs is a fantastic company. And so we're able to bring something to that, that we believe creates more value rather than trying to enter into a different type of arrangement. You mentioned the other one was Oil State. Similar kind of thing, got terrific technology, but we don't know that we want to try to plow that much capital into the rest of their business. But we do know where we can generate outsized returns for Halliburton. Yes, I would throw in another similar type thing is subsea with TechniqueFMC, who -- I really believe TechnipFMC is the absolute premier subsea company in the world. And we work closely with them, developing joint IP, delivering on electric completions, all electric completions. And so there are a lot of things we're able to do where we can mine what I think is our core competency or competitive advantage along with others without trying to broaden our way into things that aren't really strategically fit. Hope that helps, Dave.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: The first question is around a more macro question, which is one of the things that surprised us last year was the exit to exit of U.S. oil production, which came in above, I think, where consensus expectations were. You have unique visibility into U.S. completion and volumes. What do you think happened there? And as we think about 2024, how do you think about exit rate of U.S. growth? And maybe talk about the moving pieces, including DUCs.
Jeffrey Miller: Yes. Look, if I'm thinking about production growth in '24, production is a function of service intensity. So simply put, more sand, more barrels. And we saw peak levels of service intensity throughout last -- really in the first half of last year, and a lot of that comes on in the latter half. And I think some of this is efficiency in the sense that we are delivering more sand to the reservoir. And that comes in a lot of forms. E-fleets are part of that and some of the technology that we brought to market. But I also think that the market that we see for next year, it's hard for me to forecast at this point exactly what operators will do because every operator plays their own game. But at the same time, I would probably be over on rigs because I think that we'll run out of DUCs at some point. I think I would take the under only production only because whatever you think it is, I'll take the under only because what we see are stable customers delivering to their plans. But what we don't see as a lot of the smaller companies coming into the market in an effort to really ramp up production. So I think from our perspective at Halliburton, very stable market. But from a production standpoint, as we watch it unfold, it will be a matter of how much incremental sand gets pumped to overcome what is clearly going to be a decline rate that comes with when we add barrels rapidly, obviously, they fall off rapidly.
Neil Mehta: Good color there. And then you made a comment that you feel like you have international visibility through the end of the decade. Can you expand there and help give the market a little more confidence about what the post 2024-2025 file looks like?
Jeffrey Miller: Well, look, I mean we are working on tenders today for work all of next year and the following year. I mean when we talk with customers, I think about what's going to happen. Really, I don't think the North Sea and West Africa even really wake up until 2025. We've seen strong in those markets. However, the real growth we're working on planning today doesn't even start until '25. And all of these things are 3- and 4-year-type efforts. I mean these aren't individual wells in places like that. These are programs. And so we spent -- we're actually on contract with a client working on just the planning of logistics for '25-'26 and beyond. And so I've just got a lot of confidence in terms of what we see in hand, the tender pipeline and then the pipeline of work that we are planning with customers that may or may not even be tendered. It's just more a matter of it will be done. And we've got clarity on that in '25 and beyond.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram: Jeff, you mentioned that 40% of your contracted fleets this year will be Zeus going to 50% or more in '25. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how your commercial model for Zeus has evolved. And one of the things we get questions on is just the significant amount of completion efficiency gains that the industry is generated. And what is the sharing of that between E&P and service company?
Jeffrey Miller: Well, look, I think, number one, it's the value created by Zeus is what drives the contracting nature. A couple of things. When we started to develop Zeus, we started, like I said, quite a while back, our view was we want to maximize value to North America, number one. And in order to do that, we just had to -- we believe that the technology created enough value, so much value that we aren't going to build it unless it's demonstrated for customers. And I think the contracting nature of the longer-term contracts, 3-year-type contracts is because we let the market pull rather than trying to push thing into the market. It is that different and special. And as that system continues to develop and evolve, meaning automation, measurement, all of these things that drive really meaningful value, that is what's creating, I think, the different dialogue around Zeus with our customers because it will become more and more integral to how they create value as well. And then from an efficiency standpoint or like volume standpoint, our equipment is very efficient. So as we go from zipper frac to simo frac to, in this case, trial frac with the customer, that is not a one-to-one increase in horsepower requirements. So we become more efficient as those volumes go up. But that is also a unique feature, though, of Zeus and its ability to scale up, but it's not 1 one for one. And so from Halliburton perspective, we do create outsized value for Halliburton and also for our clients because we're using less equipment than we would had we gone at it in a traditional fashion. So I think that the combination of reliability but also automation, because it's -- as those fracs -- as fracs get larger, the precision gets more important. There are a whole lot of things that start to happen. And so very collaborative efforts with our clients to utilize that technology. In the case of a trial frac, really groundbreaking type work, super excited to do it with this customer.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Jeff, my follow-up, natural gas is on people's minds in North America. Just given the contango in the market, 2024 is just above 2 50. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of your activity is levered just to dry gas. And what are some of the risks to the earnings picture from a soft market for gas this year?
Jeffrey Miller: Look, we've got very little gas exposure in our business. Today, the ones -- the exposure that we do have is contracted under -- is sort of the Zeus solution somewhat and then we've got, I guess, a little bit of other things. But look, the gas work that we have is not a significant part of our overall portfolio. And so we plan for what we can see. I think legitimately, there could be equal upside on gas as LNG comes on. But we haven't baked it into our outlook today. But I would say that's clearly one of the upsides to North America, maybe more so than a downside to North America.
Operator: Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: And actually, to last week to visit a tribal frac site and saw the e-fleet. So pretty impressive setup. One of the things the customer mentioned was a slightly different, I guess, sort of price-to-value contract structure. Looks like from a margin standpoint, you're doing fine on that. But is there anything you can kind of enlighten us on, on maybe how we thought about traditional pressure pumping contracting and a lot of spot exposure versus kind of how this is going through? What does it mean in terms of sharing gains with the customer? What's the right way for us to think about that on kind of a price...
Jeffrey Miller: Look, from our standpoint, our -- Roger, thank you. We won't create value for our customers. I think you have to create meaningful value for customers in order to be a long-term supplier and partner to a customer. So we start from that position. And as you said, solid contract for us over the very long term. We went into this focused on maximize value, which in our view, means maximize returns, which we're able to do under these types of environments. And so rather than play sort of the spot -- we don't intend to play the spot game. That spot game is kind of a -- it's a win-lose on either side of the market. Really, when the market is getting tight, probably operators are losing. When it's going the other direction, service companies lose a lot. And our strategy is to stay out of that. And so right contracts with customers that, in our view, are fair and deliver a lot of value both in terms of pumping value and also recovery value. And I think that we're uniquely positioned to do that. And so improving recovery per foot or production per foot is a long-term game, and we want to play that long-term game with customers that are working on that long-term game. And we're ecstatic about the customers we have and who we get to work with, try to solve what we think are the real pressing issues of the future in North America frac. And so we don't get to play that game. That game doesn't get played successfully if it's the frac is sure. We need to be part of that process, and our clients allow us to do that.
Roger Read: Appreciate that. The follow-up question I have, it's unrelated, but I think kind of critical to the announcement this morning raising the dividend. What is the right way for us to think about your uses of free cash flow between, as you did in the fourth quarter, sort of elective repurchases of debt as opposed to maturities? But as we're thinking debt, dividend is pretty fixed here and then share repurchases. What way do you want us to think about the return of free cash flow?
Eric Carre: Yes. Thanks, Roger. It's Eric. So think about it in a fairly similar way as what we did in 2023, except higher. So we increased the dividend 6%. We're now back to about 95% of where we were pre-COVID. In terms of buyback, we intend to continue buying back share. Our intention today is to buy back more share in dollar terms in 2024 than we did in 2023. At the same time, as we did also in 2023, we intend to continue to retire debt and continue to strengthen the balance sheet. So overall, fairly similar structure in '24 as what we did in '23 but kind of bump up everything a bit higher.
Operator: Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: So Jeff, it -- you talked about West Africa, North Sea not awakening until '25. A lot of tendering or just conversations about '25-'26. I know some of the -- your partners like FTI are bidding for deliveries that wouldn't happen until '29 and '30. The offshore rig companies, they're getting locked up into '26-'27. I mean the visibility this cycle seems to me to be somewhat unprecedented. And I'm curious if that's consistent with your view of how things are playing on how customers are behaving and how your conversations are going. Because it seems like the industry is on board with -- is it going to be a long cycle? What we recognize, of course, macroeconomic events could derail things. But at least for now, with this oil price range that we're in, it's kind of all systems go for a long time.
Jeffrey Miller: Look, I'm careful speaking for the entire industry. But I would say I have this, including Halliburton, very focused on running return -- businesses for strong returns over the long term, which is precisely what we all do. And I think that's good for our clients and it's good for us as well. And so that level of visibility is not inconsistent with companies planning a future around how to make money for shareholders. And that's what we're doing as well. And so I think it's a very good setup for the rest of this decade, quite frankly, just because, a, we know there's demand; b, we are able to -- our whole value proposition around is how we collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. And this type of setup allows us to do that. The other thing that happens, though, when we run a business for returns is we don't overinvest in the business. And so we've told you kind of where our CapEx will fall and level of growth that we're looking at. And so we're very thoughtful about the growth because we are keeping profitable international growth firmly in hand. And so I think assets are tight and they'll remain tight for those very reasons. It's very natural economic reasons for an industry that's running their businesses for return, which is clearly what we're doing. And then I think our level of CapEx, the way that structured drives that level of thoughtful investment and manages the contracts that we win indirectly. And it also maximizes returning cash to shareholders. So it's a very good environment in my view.
James West: Okay. That's -- we certainly agree with that. And then maybe a follow-up for me and potentially, I don't know if Eric is going to take this one. But the D&E margins, which I know are more levered towards international, where a lot of the volume growth is certainly going to come from, and you're going to have natural operating leverage from that and inflation. It seems to be cooling somewhat so you should -- incremental should improve here. Where are you anticipating? I know you gave this quarter guidance, but that's seasonal. Where do you anticipate margins? Or maybe if you want to talk about incrementals, however you want to discuss it for D&E going forward as we go through '24 and into '25?
Eric Carre: Yes, Jim. So to your point, if you just look at Q1, obviously you get seasonal effect. So -- but more importantly, looking at the year-on-year and the general trend of the D&E margins. So first, I think it's worth noting, as Jeff mentioned in the script, that we had our best D&E margins in 15 years. So it means that a lot of the investment we have done in the last few years are paying off. So what to watch really is the general trajectory of margins in the business. And for us, it's a matter of balancing revenue growth, improvements in margin, improvements in returns as we continue to invest in the D&E business. So all of that to say that expect margins to continue to firm up as we get into '24. And we're expecting our margins to be materially higher in D&E in 2024 than they were in 2023. Now there might be some bumps along the road from 1 quarter to the next, et cetera. It's a business that typically tends to have a lot of moving parts. But directionally, margins will be higher in 2024 than they were in 2023.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup.
Scott Gruber: So Jeff, as I step back and think about the outlook for your U.S. business, it appears that you're on a pathway to establishing a business that will deliver more consistent and better free cash flow in the years ahead than we've seen historically, in part that's given the e-frac investment investment across the portfolio. So I'm wondering if you'd just give some color kind of around that. We're seeing the consistency now. If I heard correctly, the CapEx color doesn't suggest a material reduction in domestic CapEx into '24. So curious kind of around kind of bending that curve lower and just kind of overall helping this business model that's much more consistent and less CapEx-intensive ultimately.
Jeffrey Miller: Yes. Thanks. And that is precisely what we set out to do, and that's what's playing out now. And so in terms of a consistent business that generates strong free cash flow through the cycle, and that's been our intent all along. With the way we bring Zeus fleets to market, the way we invest in North America broadly, we are very deliberate about how we maximize value over the long term in North America. And I think you saw that play out in the last 2 quarters as we've seen the market moving around. But nevertheless, steady drumbeat of execution and cash flow delivery by Halliburton. And I expect to continue that because that is precisely our strategy. And so when it comes to cash flow, our capital allocation of our capital budget, we're going to allocate it to those things where we see that opportunity, which we certainly see that with Zeus fleets. But remember, that's a demand pull, not a push strategy. So we don't build fleets until we have contracts for fleets. And so that's a different -- completely different environment than maybe we would have seen in prior cycles from Halliburton, anything else we do in North America. Like we've developed some very good, in my view, fit-for-purpose drilling technology for North America. But we're not going to overbuild it. We're selling it into the market as the market will take it. It's a lot of excitement about it, but our approach is still going to be consistent delivery of margins and free cash flow in North America. And so I think you'll see us continue to do that. And that means we put e-fleets in the market, we retire sort of the fleets that are at the bottom of the stack and continue that march forward.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Okay. Appreciate the color. Unrelated follow-up here. Leverage is down to about 1x now, which is good to see. And it sounds like the cash return could step up a bit. Can you just kind of walk us through your thoughts as you move forward in time, the cycle continues, you'll generate more free cash flow, leverage continues to come down. Outside of any M&A, should we think about that shareholder return as a percentage of free cash flow moving higher given that you will be trending somewhat on leverage on a go-forward basis?
Eric Carre: Yes, yes. I mean just starting with free cash flow, I think that you can expect 2024 free cash flow to be at least 10% over '23. So that is going to basically help us return -- increase returns on a dollar basis. Now in terms of the percentage, we're still guided by our overall 50% return to shareholder. But directionally, it would make sense to believe that we'll do at least what we did in 2023 in terms of the percentage return.
Operator: Our next question comes from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.
Luke Lemoine: Jeff, your North America rev significantly outperformed the U.S. land rig count in '24. And I would guess some of the factors were Zeus fleet, service quality, more stable customer base and a pickup in the Gulf of Mexico. But could you talk about any other factors that drove this? And then with the U.S. land rig count most likely down in '24, do you think North America revs could be up in '24 for you?
Jeffrey Miller: Yes. Look, the outperformance is just the stability of the business as I described it. And so a big part of that is 40% of our fleet by the end '24 under long-term contracts. That creates a steady environment. So the rig count is going to move around and do what it does, but our largest part of our business, very stable. And the reality is the North America business is very big. We saw growth Gulf of Mexico and other offshore environments. However, a very large, stable North America business -- land business is going to mute some of that. And as we go into '25, I expect the same kind of performance out of our North America business sort of in spite of what rigs do. Now I do believe a repoint where DUCs are drawn down, they're largely drawn down. And I think that we'll see rig count increase only because it's supplying the inventory of DUCs required to run a very smooth, stable-type business. And I would say our customers largely plan their business around turning wells into production more than they do numbers of rigs in the air. And so I think there's a lot of planning that goes on to deliver a very stable business of completing wells. And so I think one of the reasons I would say I'd take the over on rig count, I don't think -- I won't try to forecast rig count at this point. But I do think there's upside in North America. We plan the business for what we can see, and we expect it to be stable. But that being said, I think there are obviously factors that could push that up. Like gas activity is clearly out there and I would pull the pace at which LNG plants come online, but we know that they will. Is it '24 event or a '25? I think we'll get to that point and see that Halliburton participates in that upside, and that could happen this year. But at this point, we're planning the business around returns.
Luke Lemoine: Okay. And I guess a follow-up with this more stable North American business, you talk about your North American land margins you're ascribing flat in 4Q. Could you talk about how you see this progressing in '24 kind of with that stable business?
Jeffrey Miller: Well, look, let's just leave it at steady and stable moving forward. I think that we've got a very strong international business as well that contributes, and I think that continues to grow and expand margins. But we're really pleased with where we are. But U.S. revenue and margins flattish through any cycle, I think, is where we wanted to get this business. Clearly, there's upside. And I do expect from a C&P standpoint, we're going to see the benefit of our market leadership positions in PE, cementing, baroid and other things that we do around the world. So I think that we're going to continue to participate in that meaningfully, particularly from a margin standpoint. But again, our key in North America is stability through cycles. And I think we're demonstrating -- I don't think, I know we're demonstrating that now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel.
Stephen Gengaro: Two for me. Wanted just to follow up on the prior question around sort of margins in C&P and the Zeus fleets. When you talk about these assets being contracted, are there any difference in sort of the pricing dynamic versus sort of prior cycles and price openers quarterly? And how should we just think about the pricing for those assets in an environment where maybe there's a little excess capacity near term from some, quite honestly, maybe not as competitive assets but older assets in the market? Does it matter -- is pricing pretty stable? Can you talk about that a bit?
Jeffrey Miller: Look, these are long-term deals that we go into knowing the cost of the asset and knowing what the return needs to be. So now it just becomes a bit of a math problem around duration. And so there are variable costs in the market that we don't control and we don't try to own. We just pass through to customers, whether it's sand cost and many other things. But for -- where we create competitive advantage for our equipment is we go into these long-term vehicles. We don't need price opener and all of that sort of jazz. There's no reason for it. We literally sit down and work through what is the return for client, return for Halliburton, and then we fix that and move forward. That doesn't change over time. And so -- well, the rest of the market, the spot-type market, all of that is going to do what it's going to do. But I think that's when we take a long view of the market in value creation, that's math that both clients and how can do. And I think that's what makes it so very different, our approach in North America. It's not particularly differentiated, if at all, in the spot market. And as a result, it's just kind of does what it does. It's on a free for all. But I would say, in the market where we want to play, which is technology-driven, lowest total cost of ownership and working on, I think, most important, which is productivity per foot. That's a different game. That's a long-term game.
Stephen Gengaro: Great. And then just one quick one, probably for Eric, on the cash flow statement. Anything we should know about working capital parameters in '24 versus '23 that would be much different as we kind of build out the models, whether it's DSOs or payables, et cetera?
Eric Carre: No. I think what's important around free cash flow is, as I mentioned earlier, is we're expecting the free cash flow to be at least 10% over '23. That's going to be on the back of improved income. It's going to be on the back also of improved efficiencies around working capital. So we spend a lot of time working on improving DSOs, working on improving DIOs. And when I speak like this, I don't mean just pushing the organization, I mean implementing different initiatives. For example, I'll give you a couple of examples on DSO. We spend a lot of time on automating the invoicing process on integrated services. For example, invoicing on integrated service is extremely complicated. We have multiple product lines, multiple parts of our organization, customer organization, so it takes a lot of time. And to the extent that you can automate that and then remove -- reduce cycle time, then you improve DSO. We just rolled out 18 months ago a company-wide demand planning software, which when combined with the rollout of S/4 in the future is going to give us totally different capabilities to plan our business and reduce inventory while not increasing the risk from an operation perspective. So these are the things where we're spending a lot of our time to basically structurally improve the efficiency of working capital. So that's going to be the other component of why we're expecting our free cash flow to improve next year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen.
Marc Bianchi: I just wanted to first clarify on the North America outlook that you provided for it to be flat. That's a comment for the full year. Is that correct? Or was that a comment from where run rates are today?
Jeffrey Miller: Look, we think that Q1 is up from Q4. So there's activity that comes back to seasonal in Q4. As we look at the balance of the year, I think that there are -- as we plan the business for what we got visibility of and we can see our fleets are largely contracted for '24, that's what we know. Are there factors that may add to that? I think -- if you have to do that, I think if production levels are low, clients may speed up. There's a lot of variables that could happen that, I think, are to the positive. But nevertheless, as we look out to '24 and we plan a business that generates the kind of returns we expect to generate, that's what we see.
Marc Bianchi: Okay. The other question I had was on D&E in the first quarter here. I think historically, there have been some onetime sales that continue for D&E in the first quarter. And then margin could be down in the second quarter. Is that sort of the base case outlook here? Or is there something unusual going on this year versus the prior years?
Eric Carre: No, there's nothing unusual. I think if you -- actually, if you were to go back and look at the Q1 '24 over Q4 '23 guidance that we just gave, it is very much in line with the typical Q4 to Q1 seasonality that we saw prior to COVID, so you go back to 2020, 2019, 2018. So what we're seeing here is really a business that's fully in line with historical trend. What's happening on the D&E side, the influence of software sales in Q4 typically is maintained in Q1. But we're having a lot of weather-related issues in the Eastern Hemisphere and the North Sea, et cetera, that is influencing our D&E margins. But again, very much in line in terms of quarter-on-quarter guidance as we have had historically in our business, nothing unusual.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with Benchmark.
Kurt Hallead: A lot of good stuff to digest here to make. Jeff, appreciate all that color. I think my question here, kind of what piqued my curiosity was, again, a couple of things that you -- one of which you put in the press release, which was a kind of AI-driven dynamic that you have going on with ADNOC. And maybe start with that one in the context of how you are seeing AI evolving as a tool for the customer base as a tool for your company. The -- how do you see the adoption of that? And how do you see the financial impact of that evolving over the course of the next couple of years?
Jeffrey Miller: Yes. Thanks, Kurt. Look, I think software and automation, and I say it that way because software business is strong and focused on enterprise solutions, which will adopt all sort of AI and generative AI as we continue to move forward. And that will create efficiency and [indiscernible] in a lot of ways for our customers. Internally, as we adopt automation and AI into our tools and service delivery, I expect that it will have a meaningful impact. Probably over the next 2, 3 to 5 years, just as those things are adopted, it's going to reduce service costs, it's going to drive demanding. And it's also going to improve service quality, and I think will actually improve the capability of tools, which I think is so fundamental to how we generate long-term returns.
Kurt Hallead: Appreciate that color. Also just that Halliburton Labs entered into a venture to some direct lithium extraction. So curious as to how you might see Halliburton involved in that process as well.
Jeffrey Miller: Well, look, that's one of our labs companies. We're excited to have them here. We make a very, very small investment in companies that join our labs, but it's very small. It's around $100,000. So it's -- we're a tiny piece of their Series B, which we're excited for them. But Hal Labs continues to attract, in my view, more quality investable companies over time. We're watching them enter Series As, and in some cases, Series B. And it's a journey. We're doing a lot different industries, but we're careful. This is clearly not corporate venture capital. We are not investing in the companies that join Hal Labs other than small 3% to 5% stake that we get from them generally for the services that we provide to them as a member of Halliburton Labs. So super excited about where that's going. But we just need to let that continue to progress on its own.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Jeff for any closing remarks.
Jeffrey Miller: Yes. Thank you, Josh. Let me close the call with this: I'm excited about 2024. I mean our outlook for oilfield services is strong, and I expect Halliburton will generate significant free cash flow for shareholders in 2024. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Let's close out the call.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Halliburton Company, Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
David Coleman: Hello! And thank you for joining the Halliburton third quarter 2023 conference call. We will make a recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other securities and exchange commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. Our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. I am pleased with the stability of our North America business and the profitability of our international growth. Let's jump right into the highlights. Total company revenue increased 8% year-over-year, while operating income grew 23%. International revenue grew 17% year-over-year with strong activity in all geographic markets. North America revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Our completion and production division grew revenue 11% year-over-year, while margins expanded 280 basis points, margins expanded 105 basis points sequentially driven by international operations, while North American C&P margins remained approximately flat the last quarter. Our drilling and evaluation division grew revenue 4% year-over-year, while margins expanded 168 basis points. Finally, we generated $874 million of cash from operations, $511 million of free cash flow and repurchased approximately $200 million of common stock and $150 million of debt during the quarter. To our over 45,000 employees globally. Thank you for another outstanding quarter, you executed our strategy and delivered excellent financial results. I'll begin with what I see in the macro environment. Reliable and affordable energy remains at the very center of global economic growth and security. The most recent world oil outlook from OPEC expects 10 million barrels of oil demand growth before the end of the decade and further demand growth through 2045. Maintaining production while adding incremental supply requires meaningful long-term investment in both short and long cycle barrels to meet demand. This challenge is reflected in our customers' activity levels and future development plans. Consistent with this outlook, we expect continued demand growth for oilfield services in 2024 and beyond. Everything I see today strengthens my conviction in the long duration of this upcycle. Against this backdrop, I believe the execution of our strategy will deliver strong free cash flow, growing margins and more cash return to shareholders. Starting with North America, Halliburton performed exactly as I expected, delivering our strategy to maximize value in North America. Our North America business has changed. Despite the U.S. rig count decreasing around 20% since Q4 of 2022, Halliburton delivered strong revenue and margin performance during this period. That's quite a different result from what Halliburton would have delivered in prior cycles. Since 2015, we changed our strategy. We changed our operating model, and the market structure changed. Our strategy in North America is to maximize value. Executing this strategy made many of our decisions over the last few years crystal clear, including our decision to invest in differentiated and value-added technologies, such as our Zeus electric fleets, automation, and our fiber optic downhole fracturing diagnostics. We know that in a competitive market to capture value, you must first create value. Our decision to derisk returns and maximize free cash flow by only building fracturing equipment under long-term contracts. And finally, our decision to retire old equipment when returns are not sufficient rather than to pursue market share. Maximizing value means just that, do the things that improve returns and stop doing the things that lower them. Next, we fundamentally changed our operating model. We removed $1 billion of fixed costs from our business in 2020. Those cost reductions were structural and remain in place today. As a result, today, our cost structure is more variable and less fixed. And it's one of the reasons we have the flexibility to pursue returns rather than market share. Our commitment to continuous improvement drove significant changes in the way we work, which delivered efficiency improvements in our operations. This resulted in a 68% improvement in hours pumped per crew in just the last four years. Finally, the E&P and services markets fundamentally changed. Today the market is more consolidated, more focused on returns, and more focused on free cash flow generation. We see the benefits of this change. Customers assign value to technology and efficiency, and the service industry is rewarded for returns rather than growth. Never before as the success of our North America business been better aligned with the success of our customers who make significant long-term investments in the region. I expect the combination of our value proposition and strategy will deliver a more profitable business that generates more free cash flow for years to come. Now let's turn to international markets, where Halliburton's revenue grew 17% compared to the same quarter of last year. In the third quarter, we saw activity increase in both divisions, though particularly in our completions and production division. Our results clearly demonstrate Halliburton strong global competitiveness in both divisions and the successful execution of our strategy for profitable international growth. We execute our profitable growth strategy through our differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins, and our unique collaborative approach with customers, all of which build on our foundation as a leader in service quality and execution. I expect the market for oilfield services will further tighten as asset intensive offshore activity increases. More importantly, I expect that pricing returns will serve as the mechanism to allocate scarce equipment. This is a great market for Halliburton to execute its strategy for profitable international growth. I'm excited about our international business and we're on track to deliver high teens year-on-year growth in 2023. Looking ahead, 2024 is coming into view and I expect to see international activity again directionally higher, with market growth in the double-digit range. I'd like to take a few minutes and talk more about our global offshore business. Let me start with some color. Offshore represents more than 50% of our business outside of North America land. About 25% of our C&P revenue is generated offshore. More than 40% of our D&E revenue is generated offshore. All of our regions contribute materially to our offshore revenue. All of our product lines operate offshore and Halliburton leads in many well construction product lines key to offshore development. Customers choose Halliburton because we collaborate and deliver impactful results. The combination of our leading product lines, and our collaboration from design through well delivery is what drives superior results for our customers. One example is in Norway, where according to IHS Rushmore data, the Aker BP Alliance where Halliburton provides well construction services consistently represents the top quartile of drilling performance. This performance matters even more in a market where offshore rig rates and spread costs are rising. With our customers, we deliver some of the most technically complex wells in our industry. We provide leading solutions in many areas including high pressure, deepwater completions, complex multilateral junctions, ultra deep reading LWD tools, narrow margin drilling fluids and tailored lightweight cement. These solutions enable our customers to efficiently and reliably develop their offshore reserves and maximize the value of their assets. Execution of our value proposition has created a strong offshore business underpinned by efficiency and differentiated technology. Our ability to compete in all parts of the offshore business including exploration, development and intervention has never been better. Let me close with this. I'm both excited and confident in the outlook for our business, the duration of this upcycle the clarity and depth of our strategy and the strength of our execution. Now I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?
Eric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Our Q3 reported net income per diluted share was $0.79. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.8 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $1 billion a sequential increase of 3%. Operating margin for the company was 17.9% in Q3, a 207 basis point increase over Q3 2022. Beginning with our completion and production division, revenue in Q3 was $3.5 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $746 million, an increase of 6% sequentially. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 21%. These results were primarily due to increased stimulation activity internationally, higher cementing activity in the eastern hemisphere, and improved completion tool sales globally. These increases were partially offset by lower pressure pumping services in North America. In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue in Q3 was $2.3 billion flat sequentially, while operating income was $378 million, which was also flat from Q2. D&E delivered an operating income margin of 16%, an increase of 168 basis points over Q3 last year. Sequential changes were driven by higher fluid services in Middle East Asia, and Latin America, and increased wireline activity in Latin America and Europe/Africa. These were offset by decreased drilling related services, lower project management activity and software sales in Mexico. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our Q3 international revenue increased 3% sequentially. Latin America revenue in Q3 was $1 billion, a 5% increase sequentially. This increase was primarily due to increased pressure pumping services, and drilling fluids in Argentina, improved completion tool sales in Brazil, and higher project management and drilling related services in Colombia and Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were lower software sales, decreased project management and lower well construction services in Mexico. Europe/Africa revenue in Q3 was $734 million, a 5% increase sequentially. This increase was primarily driven by improved well construction services, higher completion tool sales and improved wireline activity in Norway, and higher completion tool sales in the Caspian area. These were partially offset by lower activity in Africa across multiple product service lines. Middle East Asia revenue in Q3 was $1.4 billion, which was flat from q2. These results were driven by higher well construction in Iraq, increased drilling related services and completion tool sales in Qatar, and higher pressure pumping and fluid services in Asia. These were offset by decreased activity in multiple product service lines in Kuwait, and India and lower drilling, testing and well intervention services in Asia. In North America, revenue in Q3 was $2.6 billion, a 3% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased pressure pumping services in U.S. land, and lower well intervention services in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these decreases was improved completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. Moving on to other items, in Q3, our corporate and other expenses were $64 million. For Q4, we expect our corporate expense to increase by about $5 million as a result of timing and special items. In Q3, we spent $23 million, or about $0.03 per diluted share on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our results. For Q4, we expect these expenses to be approximately $14 million, which makes our spent approximately $50 million for 2023 as planned. Net interest expense for the quarter was $93 million, which was flat from the prior quarter. For Q4, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Other net expense for Q3 was $28 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For Q4, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Our effective tax rate for Q3 came in at 21%, based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to remain approximately flat. Capital expenditure for Q3 were $409 million, we anticipate that for the full year, capital expenditure will be approximately 6% of revenue. Our Q3 cash flow from operations was $874 million, and free cash flow was $511 million. We expect to generate over $2 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2023. Finally, consistent with our capital return policy of returning at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $200 million of our common stock during Q3. Additionally, during Q3, we repurchased $150 million of debt. Now turning to our near-term outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see Q4 unfolding. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate revenue to decrease by 3% to 5% sequentially, while operating margins are expected to decrease 25 to 75 basis points as a result of lower North America land activity due to holidays and lower winter month efficiencies, partially offset by higher year-end completion tool sales. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate revenue to grow by 4% to 6% sequentially, while operating margins are expected to increase 75 to 125 basis points due to seasonal software sales and higher global activity. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. Our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. I'm pleased with the stability of our North America business and the profitability of our international growth. Our North America business performed exactly as I expected, delivering our strategy to maximize value in North America. Our international results clearly demonstrate Halliburton's strong global competitiveness in both divisions and the successful execution of our strategy for profitable international growth. Execution of our value proposition has created a strong offshore business, and our ability to compete in all parts of the business has never been better. And now let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Dave Anderson with Barclays. Please proceed.
Dave Anderson: So Jeff, the duration story internationally is very compelling with the capacity expansion in Middle East, offshore FIDs and offshore work that you were talking about. So I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how that translates into the cadence of international growth over the next 12 to 24 months. International sale looks a little sluggish this quarter, MENA was flat. I know Kuwait's been a bit slow, but I'm just wondering, should we start to see the region accelerate in 2024?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thank you, Dave. And look, I expect that it will. And I've talked about growth for 2024 double digits. But to frame that, our strategy is profitable international growth. And we've grown 20% in '22, high teens this year, double digits next year. So I'm comfortable with the growth and expect we will continue to see strong growth, certainly above market growth. But we're doing that while improving margins and expanding margins. And so I think that our strategy is crystal clear around what we're going about. There's plenty of market there to do that and expect we will continue to do that in '24 and beyond.
Dave Anderson: And if I could just shift over to kind of one of the big topics out there is M&A, Chevron, Exxon, [indiscernible] EPs in North America. Can you talk a bit about what this means to Halliburton. On the one hand, I'm thinking this should provide you really significant visibility on your development programs. On the other hand, perhaps your pricing levers might be a bit compromised if you only have a handful of large customers. Could you just kind of big picture, talk about what's leading to your business, please?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Big picture, good for Halliburton. I think it does a couple of things what we're seeing. Certainly, it demonstrates the long-term importance of oil and gas and more specifically, worldwide and more importantly, the long-term importance of North America. I mean what we're seeing are big players that take a really long view, and these are the kind of customers that clearly work through cycles. And so I think we'll see a much more stable North America I really like our position with our customer mix today is clearly biased. Most of our work is with very large privates and publics. And so I like our position there. And then more importantly, these are customers that care about the kinds of things we work on at Halliburton. So when we work on, I think important things like productivity, efficiency and recovery. And we talk about all 3 of those in our business. And I think we're unique in the way that we approach those. So I think it will be good for Halliburton.
Dave Anderson: And what this accelerated adoption of e-frac, you think, with both of those two customers?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think that's exactly the kind of tool that customers like this want to have in their hands, and we're seeing pretty good adoption. I would say north of 60% of our business today are repeat customers. So these aren't science projects. This is things that are being baked into workflows.
Operator: It comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Neil Mehta: One of the notable things about the quarter was the return of capital, the $200 million of share repurchases. Maybe you could just frame out for the market, how you're thinking about your share repurchase strategy and setting us up for your framework as we go into 2024?
Eric Carre: Yes. Good morning, Neil. So look, dividends and it's clearly part of our return strategy. But directionally nothing has changed in our overall policy of returning about 50% or over 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. I mean right now, we like the flexibility that buybacks give us, and we're thinking similarly as we get into next year. If we look at what we've done this year, we've returned $1 billion already to shareholders so far this year. As our business continues to grow and our margins continue to improve as well. I would expect that these overall returns would be higher as we get into 2024.
Neil Mehta: Okay. That's helpful. And we appreciated a little bit of color on 4Q, but I was wondering if you could kind of unpack some of that guidance a little bit more, talk about what you're thinking about from a regional perspective? And any comments that we need to keep in mind as we think about the next quarter sequentially.
Eric Carre: Yes. I think, Neil, we're typically giving guidance on a division basis, which is the way we report numbers, and I think we will leave it at that.
Jeff Miller: Well, maybe just a little bit of color around North America, we're going to see some seasonality as we've described it in the last few years. We've had really strong tailwinds into Q4. I would expect this year, we'll see what I would describe as more normal seasonality. And then, clearly, there will be completion tools and other sales in there that help internationally, we'll probably see software sales in Q4, probably Q1 and more activity and more pricing. And hopefully, that's helpful color.
Operator: And it comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: If I could, I'd love, Jeff, as you would talk a little bit about the competitive environment that you see in front of you now. It seems to me that we've had a big change in the overall market over the last decade or so with one competitor kind of dropping back, one moving into other non-oil and gas businesses and so kind of leaving the oil and gas side is somewhat about a duopoly for yourself and your main competitor but both of you are focused on returns. And so it's not a pricing fight or a market share fight, it's kind of, hey, we're in the same game, let's generate cash, let's generate free cash flow to get back to shareholders. Let's get pricing up for returns. Is that kind of how you see '24, '25, '26 unfolding or am I mistaken in my view, we've got a different competitive environment.
Jeff Miller: Well, James, it's highly competitive in the marketplace. And we are absolutely focused on our strategy at Halliburton and I've been really clear about that. And so independent of what anyone does in the marketplace from a Halliburton standpoint, we are maximizing value in North America. We are growing profitably internationally and driving capital efficiency. And I think some of the cash flows that you see and improving cash flow that you see is driven out of our fundamental strategy to develop R&D that is more capital efficient. And so this has been a strategy underway for probably 5 or 6 years, maybe longer. And today, we're seeing the fruits of that. But from a competitive perspective, highly competitive marketplace and we're always continuing to lower total cost of ownership for our customers and also drive the three things. And the outcome of that is clearly better free cash flow, more cash flow return to customers, but it starts with that basic strategy.
James West: Right. Got it. Okay. And then, if we think about North America as this cash machine, as I think about it for you guys, with some seasonality here in the fourth quarter, do you anticipate pricing degradation? Or do you think that everything kind of holds up here and we're in just kind of this continued harvesting period.
Jeff Miller: Well, look, I think that North America, as we look forward into '24, the consolidation activity that we've seen is clearly a demonstration of how important North America is. In the kind of environment that we're in today, it's hard for me to imagine operators who want to be smaller rather than bigger given the $85, $90 commodity price. So I think that will drive certain amount of activity up from here. From our perspective, we see largely a steady market from as you described it, just partly because we are focused on retiring diesel fleets and transitioning to electric. We've got a very clear strategy around North America. And we believe that our service quality performance and technology, those get better every day, and they drive margins. So this is an important component. They drive margins. And I think our customers understand the level of investment required in order to deliver service quality, performance and technology. So we've seen what this market looks like when we burn up equipment at very low returns that don't allow for that reinvestment, probably we've seen that, that's not a good outcome certainly not for service companies, but it's also not a good outcome for operators. So I think that's what gives me confidence in sort of the stability of this. And to that point, we're mostly I'd say, mostly contracted for 2024.
Operator: And it comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
Roger Read: Yes. Good morning. Probably just to follow up on a couple of the questions already been asked, maybe slightly differently. As you think about the outlook here for the fourth quarter and maybe in the first half of '24, I was just curious where you feel like you're being properly cautious, maybe slightly overly cautious and where you think things actually need to come through to sort of hit the numbers, right? I'm just sort of looking for some guidelines maybe of what to pay attention to as the quarter unfolds.
Jeff Miller: Look, I think the guidance we've given you is fairly clear, and we've got a lot of confidence in the way we looked at the market. And as I described, seasonality in North America, it's something we've certainly seen before and we know what that looks like. I expect our international business continues to do, continues to grow, and we've already sort of laid out what we expect this year to look like. So I feel confident in our outlook. And then, as we go into the first half of next year, I think that we're going to clearly see North America up from here. Maybe that's the color that wasn't clear when I answered the last question. But in terms of sort of where the commodity price is and also not as dependent on that, but really what we're seeing in terms of customers' plans. And also, just the decline rates in North America. So the reality is you have to do more work in order to stay flat. And so I suspect that we'll see some of that as well. As the rest of next year plays out, it's too early to call that. We don't have budget numbers from customers but the customers operating in North America today are the kinds of folks that execute their plans and so those plans will be executed. I hope that's helpful.
Roger Read: Yes, it is. My follow-up question is a little bit different tack. But it gets back to some of your opening comments about adjusting your cost structure and less fixed, more variable, we've typically thought of the way to measure performance with service companies in Halliburton, off the incremental margins. But if the fixed costs are becoming more variable, then maybe we don't see quite the same change in the incremental margin, but we'd still pay attention to the absolute margin. So maybe just as a way to ask about where you think the absolute margin can go relative to what we've seen over the last several quarters, any expectations there. I mean, is it -- these margins with revenue growth or margin expansion from here?
Jeff Miller: Well, look, I tend to always think more about margin expansion just because it's sort of core to how we're operating the business. But I think that the cost reductions have been super important. And I think a lot of what we've seen has been off the back of that but that's critical to how we run the business. And as I've said, maximizing value in North America is our fundamental strategy, and that will translate into strong incrementals, which we've seen. And I don't expect those have gone away, but that's partly because of the type of equipment we're putting in the market as much as anything. And so as we continue to pivot from diesel to electric, I would expect to see over time as those go into the marketplace, stronger incrementals. I would also say the same about what we're doing sort of quietly but equally important with drilling tools in North America. So we have been able to put together much better capital efficiency around our drilling business, and it's gaining traction. So those are the kind of things that drive incrementals even off of a fairly low fixed cost base.
Operator: And it comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please proceed.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning. Jeff, the trends in the U.S. certainly seem positive for Halliburton. So my question is, if we experience just a half recovery in market activities, so let's just say we get back about 50% of the rigs that we lost in the U.S. In that scenario, can Halliburton get back close to operating your peak frac fleet count from earlier this year. Can you get back close to peak numbers in that scenario?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. So I mean, look, we've got a really good position in North America. And I think as we look at '24, a couple of things, even beyond activity is, I view we have asymmetric sort of opportunity in North America. So I've said, I expect activity to be up, not down as we go into '24, just given where we are and as you described it. But the opportunity is around demand we see for [indiscernible]. So that's an opportunity that is largely unique to us in terms of the way we're approaching that. And certainly, our drilling business is equally an asymmetric opportunity for Halliburton just given the fundamental change in technology and the ability to put that to work in North America. And I think that will benefit on its own just from the technology, but equally so, maybe from any growth in rig count will only accelerate the uptake on that technology.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And another unique opportunity for Halliburton has been on the production side of the business, particularly outside of the U.S. as you take in the [indiscernible] business internationally and build the chemical facility in the Middle East. Can you just update us on the outlook for continued share gains within production outside of the U.S. in 2024?
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks. The lift business continues to grow. I mean, this is a fantastic technology. And the reason it's leading in North America is because of its execution and its technology. And those are the same reasons that we're seeing the growth internationally. And so also an initial really solid contract in Kuwait that has continued to expand in the Middle East with trials and opportunities and actually getting meaningful traction. Similarly, in Latin America, where we had quite a bit of success in a variety of countries, including Ecuador and others. And look, lift is becoming -- our ESPs are becoming more resilient, the technology continues to improve. The summit team is at the leading edge of that. And so look, very high expectations for where they go and expect that, that is, again, another unique international growth opportunity for Halliburton, very resilient in the North America sort of independence of activity rig count activity. And then, the chemical business is it continues to get traction. We're on pace, we're on plan, I would say, with the plant in the Middle East. So it's doing what we had expected it to do. And so pleased with where we are.
Operator: And it comes from the line of Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.
Luke Lemoine: Jeff, you talked last quarter about a record number of these fleets that you signed in 2Q. I wanted to see if you could give us a qualitative update on incremental these fleets maybe interest from customers and how you see your, this program shaping up for 24? And then, if you could provide any commentary on conventional equipment displacements, that would be helpful, too.
Jeff Miller: Look, we've continued on the track we were on. We've continued to see very strong demand. Yes, we've signed up new fleets. This quarter, we put a couple of work. I believe that trajectory is unchanged. And so very pleased with the trajectory that we see around e-fleets and they're performing very, very well. So that continues to sort of build up the confidence of the market and that technology. I think that the fact that they are lower TCO than existing equipment is a big part of why they are successful. From a displacement standpoint, we've described as we bring out electric equipment, we would retire diesel equipment. And I've always said, it's not a perfect science of 1:1. But we've had an opportunity this year to retire diesel fleets, which we've described. And by doing that has effectively accelerated the marketplace. And what we're really pleased to see a repeat customer. And I think that's an important component of confidence in the technology, customers come back for a second one.
Operator: And it comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Please proceed.
Stephen Gengaro: Two things for me. The first, when you think -- you mentioned this I think a little bit earlier, Jeff, but when you think about U.S. production levels, where do you think frac fleet activity needs to be. Are we around that level, do you think to keep production flat under or over.
Jeff Miller: Look, I think that's going to be unique to different and certainly the different operators and levels of efficiency and many other things. Look, I think that we'll know a lot more as we go into next year and start to see where production levels are. Clearly, this year saw a lot of broad activity by a lot of operators early in the year, and I suspect North America is getting the benefit of that right now. The private market was super busy the first part of the year 2023. You saw that group not really drill wells as we got into the late summer, which is the time they normally would. And so I think that will weigh on probably production as we go into '24. That said, we've got a commodity market that is probably quite supportive. And so it'd be hard to imagine less, not more. But in terms of production going into 2024, it would seem that a big chunk of what was added in '23 is not repeating right now with good weigh on production. That said, as I've said before, I think we'll see activity up, not down from here for those reasons.
Stephen Gengaro: Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up question was around sort of the maybe lesser Tier 1 acreage out there and sort of the impact that you think it has on how's business from both the pressure pumping but also across C&P in North America as far as, does it help, do you think efficiencies are slowing on the completion side. So how does that phenomena play into sort of demand and service intensity of sort of on a per production or per well basis.
Jeff Miller: Look, it drives service intensity up without question. And that's good for Halliburton. It also drives technology in terms of things like our downhole diagnostics, which we call SmartFleet. But I mean I think addressing productivity per foot which comes in the form of efficiency, and placement, reconciling all of those things between well design and production, having the tools to do that, and that's precisely what we introduced to the marketplace in the form of SmartFleet, which is a critical building block in my view, solving for that. And I think that's why we're seeing uptake on that technology. So I think that never bet against this industry ever. I mean our customers in North America are very smart, very good, very competitive. And the history of this industry broadly is improving recovery factors, whether it's through process and methodology or automation or in many cases, just physics and science. And I think that what that does do is it drives more reps for Halliburton. It will drive more sand in wells that will do a lot of things. But I also expect, as we've done for so many years, that we'll see the actual breakeven cost or the cost of producing oil and gas in North America continue to come down on the back of technology.
Operator: It comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please proceed.
Marc Bianchi: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the C&P performance here in the third quarter and the outlook for fourth quarter. If I look at sort of the original guidance for third quarter, it was for margins to be flat, but they ended up growing by 100 basis points. And then as we look to fourth quarter, the decline is kind of guided to 100 basis points. Was there a pull forward of some completion tool sales that would usually occur in the fourth quarter? Is that explaining it? Or are there some other elements that we should be thinking about as we bridge from where we were in the second quarter?
Jeff Miller: Look, I expect to see strong performance from C&P, Q4 and beyond. Look, I think that I've described some seasonality. But I think what you're really seeing is the quantity and the quality of the development work that's happening around the world. I mean, you saw equipment is clearly tight moving up. We've got a leadership position. And several things in C&P whether it's production enhancement, which is very important internationally as well, cementing and completion tools. And then, certainly, it helps that North America executed very well. So we've seen flat margins despite the rig count being down.
Marc Bianchi: Okay. Thanks for that Jeff. The other one I had was on kind of the international growth. So if I look at your Middle East and Africa, it was flat this quarter. I'm curious how you're thinking about that region and maybe the other regions if we're going to get to sort of a low double digits for the year. are any regions leading that or would you expect them all to grow at a similar type rate?
Jeff Miller: Well look, as I said, I expect we finished this year at high double digits, not low double digits. And so look, expect to see growth, but we're seeing growth everywhere. I mean, growth can be lumpy at different times. It depends on what's happening in a particular region on any given day or set of quarters. But I would say this quarter, we've grown 17% overall and would expect to see solid growth in '24. And so that will be in bright region, but I am not concerned at all about quarter-to-quarter where growth happens to be. We've seen very strong in Middle East earlier this year, and we'll probably see growth for the full year. So I think that quarter-to-quarter, trying to measure that is not as impactful as sort of year-on-year. And I think we take a set of assets and we put them to work where we see the best returns on them. And some of those C&P margins that you're seeing are at the root of that.
Operator: It comes from the line of Jim Rollyson with Raymond James. Please proceed.
Jim Rollyson: Jeff, I just had one question. On the pricing front, you've talked about this, obviously, over the past few quarters. And my recollection historically is international pricing kind of takes a longer cycle to roll over. I'm kind of curious what you think -- what inning you think we're in from a pricing perspective if we're truly in this longer duration cycle and just how you think about that impact from here on margins since your margins are pretty strong relative to historical cycles already.
Jeff Miller: Look, I think that continue to strengthen. [Technical Difficulty]. We expect margins to continue to strengthen. The asset feedback, let's see. We expect margins to continue to strengthen internationally because they tend to move 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. However, what's important is, we're also seeing growth in offshore at the same time. And so we've got a tightening of capacity that sort of comes at a higher rate from offshore work just because it requires more capital offshore than it does onshore. And so the type of activity that we're seeing is continuing to tighten the market. At the same time, so that's driving pricing to a large degree. And I think the type of activity that we see planned that is either underway or being tendered or just being planned that clearly extends well into the decade is going to serve to drive our pricing.
Operator: And it comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please proceed.
Kurt Hallead: I'm kind of curious here, Jeff, right, you given mentioned a number of different positive factors, right, that are driving your business, both internationally and domestically. And on the domestic front, right, your fleet mix, technology, service quality, et cetera. So with that dynamic and with that kind of mix, right, are you confident or comfortable enough to suggest that you think your North America revenue could grow in 2024, even if overall activity is flat or down?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Yes. I mean, again, I think we've got some unique opportunity. Asymmetric sort of positioning with Halliburton in terms of electric fleets that we're able to do that the market wants and that we can produce that is unique to Halliburton. And also, as I've described, our drilling technology as that grows in North America that will be, again, an opportunity for growth for Halliburton that probably won't be consistent across the broader piece of that. So yes, I am confident that Halliburton has the ability and will grow.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. Good. Great. Now I have a follow-up. I think in your prior conversations, I understood this correctly that when you're being approached by customers to talk about e-fleet opportunities. You guys are kind of looking at contractual commitments that maybe could be as long as 3 years. Is that still the case?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, it's a very good technology. We've talked about maximizing value in North America. That is what we're doing. And part of maximizing value in North America is building technology that customers want and creates value for customers. And for that, this is a fairly low risk decision by an operator realistically. The operators that we're talking to about e-fleets are the kind of operators that will always have equipment working. The reality is the first question is describe a scenario where you won't be fracking at all and the answer to that is there is no scenario where a large operator will not be fracking. Then it becomes, why wouldn't you want that one fleet at least to be your lowest cost operating fleet because it's burning natural gas, it's emitting less and it's working at the highest performance. At that point, this becomes a much easier discussion because it is the lowest cost operating fleet. It is extremely high efficiency and it lowers their overall cost. And so all of a sudden, that type of commitment isn't a huge hurdle to get over for customers that are committed to the long term in this business and that's been our experience. And I think that new capital should earn a return as part of maximizing value and we've got something that creates value for customers.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A answer period. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff Miller.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Carmen. Before we close out, Halliburton delivered an impressive third quarter. And our margin strength demonstrated the power of our strategy. Everything I see today strengthens my conviction and the long duration of this up cycle. So I look forward to speaking with you next quarter, Carmen will close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. And with that, we thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-19 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Halliburton Company, Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. 
David Coleman : Hello! And thank you for joining the Halliburton Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. We will make a recording of today's webcast available for seven days on Halliburton's website after this call.

Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. 
Jeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter Halliburton once again delivered strong results driven by service quality, outstanding execution and strong global demand for high quality and high performance oilfield services. Let's get right to the highlights.  Total company revenue increased 14% year-over-year. Operating income grew 41% compared to second quarter of 2022 adjusted operating income. International revenue grew 17% year-over-year with strong activity in all markets. North America revenue grew 11% year-over-year.  Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 19% year-over-year, while margins expanded by 320 basis points. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 7% year-over-year, while margins expanded nearly 300 basis points. Finally, we generated $1.1 billion of cash from operations, $798 million of free cash flow, and repurchased approximately $250 million worth of shares during the quarter.  Halliburton delivered an impressive first half of 2023. I'd like to thank our employees for these outstanding results. Thank you for executing on our mainstays and strategy delivery.  Now, let's turn to what I see in the markets and what I believe is driving this multi-year upcycles duration. Demand for oil and gas is strong as demonstrated by demand growth of 2 million barrels per day in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. Oil and gas continues to demonstrate its critical role in the global economy and meeting long term demand requires sustained capital investment.  Commodity prices remain attractive. When I talk to customers they expect to work more, not less, and many of their activity plans extend into the next decade. Customers are settling in for a long duration upcycle. Overall, I expect upstream spending to grow in 2023 and beyond. For this year, I expect International and North America customer spending growth in the high teens and around 10% respectively compared to last year, despite reduced rig count and completion activity in the U.S.  Now let's start with our performance in the international markets. Revenue in the second quarter grew 17% compared to the same period of last year with strong activity across both divisions. Today more than 20% of our tender pipeline represents incremental activity, which is as high as I can recall.  Equally important, in addition to strong growth in the Middle East and Latin America, we see steady growth in activity across the globe. In this environment, I expect quality services and equipment to remain tight and pricing to continue to improve.  Halliburton's strategy is to deliver a profitable international growth. We are clear in how we do this, through differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins, and a unique collaborative approach to working with our customers. Our differentiated technology and digital portfolio deliver high quality and high performance to our customers in all markets. Here are some examples.  Our drilling and LWD technology platforms deliver better reliability, data capture, and efficiency for our customers, while structurally expanding our margins. We build and deploy leading-edge drilling equipment that requires less capital to build and operate, compared to the prior generation of equipment. One example, for a customer in the Middle East, Halliburton achieved a world record for the longest well ever drilled, with a measured depth of over 51,000 feet, using Halliburton's iCruise, iStar and LOGIX Technologies.  Our leading position in Completions Technology is unlocking production for customers. We recently set another world record with the successful installation of the first 12 ZONE intelligent completion for a Middle East offshore customer using Halliburton's SmartWell technology on our eCompletions Platform. In our digital business, Equinor joins several other customers in selecting Landmark’s DecisionSpace 365 as their standard subsurface data interpretation tool.  During the second quarter, our Landmark software business closed on the acquisition of Resoptima, a leader in advanced ensemble modeling at the reservoir level. I'm excited about Resoptima's technology, both standalone and how it accelerates Landmark's roadmap for next-generation reservoir modeling technology.  Now, turning to collaboration. Our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers and our mainstay processes define how we consistently differentiate our services. This is the source of our competitive advantage. Our value proposition creates an environment where our customers and Halliburton collectively perform better.  A recent example of this is Halliburton and Vår Energi's announcement of a long-term strategic relationship for drilling services. I expect we will demonstrate with Vår, as we have with other customers, that our collaborative approach creates significantly better operational and financial performance for both the customer and Halliburton.  Our international strategy works. Our differentiated, cost-effective technologies and collaborative approach with customers empower us to strategically target work where we see a competitive advantage and a clear path to outperform financially.  Turning to North America, we delivered a solid quarter. North America revenue grew 11% versus the same period last year, and margins were sequentially flat versus the last quarter. Looking ahead into the second half, I expect overall market activity in North America will be slightly lower than in the first half.  More importantly, I expect Halliburton's North America margins to remain strong for the balance of the year. Our results in North America clearly demonstrate the success of our strategy to maximize value. We do this through capital efficiency, differentiated technology, and alignment with high-quality customers.  During our last call, I outlined the steps we took in North America land to maintain pricing and deploy service capacity to attractive return opportunities or retire old equipment to further accelerate Halliburton's transition to our electric fleets. Executing on our strategy during the second quarter, we deployed additional Zeus fleets on multi-year contracts, while retiring additional diesel equipment.  Demand for our Zeus e-fleets is strong. In fact, during the second quarter we signed more multi-year Zeus contracts than in any prior quarter. The multi-year duration of these contracts provides both stability and secure economic returns, which furthers my confidence in the strength of our margins. I continue to be impressed by the performance of our Zeus e-fleets and the optimization and efficiencies that come with scale. Our current system is the result of multiple iterations over several years and our continuous improvement processes. Every element of the value chain, from design and manufacturing to operations and maintenance, is continuously improved. Our advances in pump technology and system design result in higher horsepower density and pump efficiency.  With Octave, we are automating equipment operation for consistency and reliability. We work to be the best at getting better. Today, Zeus is a fully integrated system. We deliver new equipment on time that works right out of the box and on average this year our e-fleets pumped over 10% more hours than our high-performance diesel fleets.  For our customers, these improvements mean better performance and even lower total cost of ownership. For Halliburton, these improvements mean we further widen the moat around our growing e-fleet business. In all markets, international and North America, I believe our strategies yield improved financial results.  Let's look at the steady growth and margin expansion in D&E. This is the result of a structural change and technology overhaul that began several years ago.  Our leading drilling platforms are lower cost and higher performance than the prior generation, which drives higher asset velocity and higher returns. In our testing business, our FloConnect Surface well testing service provides a safe, efficient, and automated platform to our customers, while lowering our overall operating costs. In our Wireline business, our Xaminer platform provides high quality reservoir data, reduces subsurface uncertainty, and allows us to win high-value exploration work.  Finally, across all product lines, automation and remote operations are beginning to transform service delivery, driving higher quality and reliability, while lowering total cost of service delivery. Looking through any quarterly fluctuations and seasonality, I fully expect D&E margins will continue to expand over time. Our strategy also generates strong free cash flow, and our capital return framework returns cash to our shareholders. I expect over 50% of free cash flow will be returned to shareholders this year.  I am pleased with where we are today. In the last 18 months we retired $1.2 billion of debt, strengthening our balance sheet; twice increased our quarterly dividend, which forms the stable foundation of our capital return framework; and finally, repurchased approximately $600 million worth of shares, including approximately $250 million this quarter. I fully expect that the execution of our strategy in this long duration upcycle will deliver better returns, more free cash flow, and more cash back to shareholders.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric. 
Eric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Before I begin the financial review, I'd like to discuss one item. In the second quarter, we kicked off our SAP S4 upgrade and recorded a $13 million expense, or about $0.01 per diluted share, in our Q2 operating results. Future expenses will be both included in our operating results and in our quarterly guidance. Here are a few more details on the upgrade.  This upgrade will take place over the next 2.5 years, concluding around Q4, 2025. We expect it to provide efficiencies, cost savings, and advanced analytics that will benefit Halliburton and our customers. The total project investment should be approximately $250 million, $50 million this year, and $100 million in each of the next two years. Upon completion, we expect significant ongoing savings, which will pay back the investment in about three years.  Now, let me move on to our quarterly results. Our second quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.68. Excluding the effect of the transaction in Argentina, our adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.77.  Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.8 billion, a 2% sequential increase, while operating income was $1 billion, a sequential increase of 4%. Operating margin for the company was 17.4% in the second quarter, a 329 basis points increase over second quarter of 2022 adjusted operating margin. These results were primarily driven by strong international activity across both divisions, along with improved pricing.  Beginning with our completion and production division, revenue in the second quarter was $3.5 billion, a 2% sequential increase, while operating income was $707 million, an increase of 6% sequentially. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20%. These results were due to increased activity from multiple product lines in international markets and higher artificial lift activity in North America.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the second quarter was $2.3 billion, a sequential increase of 2%, while operating income was $376 million, a sequential increase of 2%. D&E delivered an operating income margin of 16%. These results were driven by higher drilling activity and increased fluid services in key regions including Middle East and Latin America, partially offset by seasonal roll-off of software sales across multiple regions.  Now, let's move on to geographic results. Our second quarter international revenue increased 7% sequentially due to solid product sales, activity increases and pricing gains across multiple product lines. These results were impacted by lower software sales in the eastern hemisphere.  In North America, revenue in the second quarter was $2.7 billion, a 2% decrease sequentially. This decline was primarily driven by decreased stimulation activity in U.S. land, partially offset by increased artificial lift activity in U.S. land and higher activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico.  Latin America revenue in the second quarter was $994 million, a 9% increase sequentially, resulting from higher completion tool sales in Brazil and improved activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico and Argentina. Partially offsetting this increase is reduced activity in the Caribbean across multiple product service lines.  Europe/Africa revenue in the second quarter was $698 million, a 5% increase sequentially. This improvement was primarily driven by increased fluid services across the region and higher completion tool sales in Angola and Norway.  Middle East/Asia revenue in the second quarter was $1.4 billion, a 6% increase sequentially, largely resulting from higher completion tool sales in Saudi Arabia and higher Wireline activity, drilling services, and stimulation activity in the region. This improvement was partially offset by decreased project management activity in Saudi Arabia.  Moving on to other items. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $59 million. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to increase by about $5 million to $10 million.  As noted earlier, in the second quarter we spent $13 million or about $0.01 per diluted share on SAP S4 migration, which is included in our operating results. For the third quarter, we expect these expenses to be approximately $20 million or about $0.02 [ph] per diluted share.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $92 million. The increase this quarter was primarily related to the reduction of interest income as a result of the Argentina transaction. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $32 million. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat.  Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 21.3%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to increase by approximately 50 basis points. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $303 million. We anticipate that for the full year, capital expenditure will be approximately 6% of our revenue. Our second quarter cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $798 million. We expect to generate free cash flow for the full year 2023; that is 30% to 40% higher than last year. Finally, we repurchased $248 million of our common stock during the second quarter.  Now, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the third quarter unfolding. In our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be essentially flat with the second quarter and margins to remain approximately flat. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue to increase in the low single digits and margins to increase 25 to 75 basis points.  I will now turn the call back to Jeff. 
Jeff Miller : Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Our international business is growing at a strong pace across all regions. I expect our differentiated technology offerings, selective contract wins, and our unique collaborative approach to working with our customers to deliver higher international margins and growth for Halliburton.  Our strategy to maximize value in North America is driven by capital efficiency, differentiated technology and alignment with high-quality customers. I expect this will allow us to generate solid financial performance. I expect that the execution of our strategy in this long-duration upcycle will deliver better returns, more free cash flow, and more cash back to shareholders.  And now, let's open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. 
David Anderson : Hi! Good morning, Jeff. 
A - Jeff Miller: Hey!
David Anderson : So, North America's slowing down a bit. International's starting to accelerate, to be expected. But I was wondering if you could perhaps take a bit of a step back and talk about how you see the primary markets trending in the next kind of 12 to 24 months in terms of NAM [ph], Middle East, and offshore. Maybe set LATAM aside, which has been a steady growth market.  I guess my question is, in terms of the cadence, how do you see the trajectory of each of these markets playing out? You lowered NAM spend. I think you were saying 10% up from down from 15%. So is that kind of flattish in the second half of the year? And then how do you see the ramp up in the Middle East and then the timing of offshore? I know it's a lot, but maybe kind of this bigger picture, how you see those markets trending [inaudible]? 
A - Jeff Miller: Certainly. And look, I'm as confident as I have ever been in the duration, the long duration of this cycle. And that's rooted in attractive commodity price and really the growth in demand for oil, so I'll start there.  I think the offshore piece of this, we're super excited about it. If we include Gulf of Mexico, we're eclipsing 50% of our revenues internationally are offshore, and so all of our service lines are represented there.  I think the cadence as I look over the next year, let's say year or so, I mean it just takes time to get this work underway. I'm just back from a trip and we were looking at projects that, you know they have to get rigs, get plans, get agreement from governments, but it's starting and I expect it continues to build into ‘24 and beyond. I mean, these are the kinds of projects that take a decade to do and so… You know Middle East, I see the same thing. The number of rigs being mobilized in the Middle East, that takes some time to do. But we are beginning to see it. We are seeing it, but my view is that we’ll continue to build over the next 12 or 24 months.  Coming back to North America, I gave you an outlook on the second half of the year. But I think what's most important is, when I look into ‘24, I mean commodity markets are getting more constructive, oil prices firming up, gas seems to have found its footing you know and expect that ramps. We're seeing some consolidation with customers and that means that bigger customers do more planning through the cycle. They are committed to executing plans over a longer term and service intensity in North America never lets up. In fact, it only gets harder and you can't – you got to – you got to work harder just to stand still. So all of this is constructive for Halliburton's business as I look out into ‘24 and beyond. And you know, and some of that in North America, I mean just that it’s backed up by the pace of e-fleet contracts that we're seeing. We've had more contracts last quarter. We've even signed another one this quarter, and that's really for work that starts in ‘24 and goes ‘24, ‘25, ‘26. So, there are a lot of reasons that I see ‘24 looking super strong for us. 
David Anderson : And then, Jeff, maybe we can just kind of get into the heart of kind of where a lot of the chatter has been during the quarter. Obviously, rig count has been falling. We've been hearing about pricing and pumping getting softer. Of course, a lot of this is coming from your competitors who would love to pay less for these services.  Can you give us some insight in kind of what you're seeing in the pricing trend? Is the softness kind of really stuck on the Tier 2 side? In your comments you talked about your Zeus fleets holding up. Is the Tier 4 holding up? What do you see on the competitive pricing side? If you can just kind of give us some more context here, because we just kind of hear these kind of generalized comments and I have a feeling there's more to it. I was wondering if you could provide some more context please. 
A - Jeff Miller: Well, I think that – you know I've told you what we're doing, which is retiring older equipment and transitioning to electric and so I think that's an important factor. We really don't see, we don't participate in the bottom part of that market particularly at all, really where that’s the spot type market. Most of our work, I'd say over 70% of our work is with large privates and publics and so – you know these are customers that execute their plans and they do execute their plans.  And from our perspective, the performance – we continue to see our performance improving, okay, even as we add electric, but also even on our diesel fleets. And differentiated service performance, technology is getting better. I mean those are things that drive not only margins, but they are also part of the dialogue around what's it take to actually run a high-performing business that requires engines, transmissions and people. And we really haven't seen any deflation in those things. 
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan.
Arun Jayaram: Hey Jeff, maybe just a follow-up to David's question. One question we get is, how do softer conditions called in the spot market influence pricing on your dedicated fleets or as you start some of your price negotiations on 2024 in North America? 
Jeff Miller: Well look, I think that – you know again, we've got a little exposure to the spot as I described. I would say broadly, as we look ahead, high-performance, high-quality services really matter and we see a lot of bifurcation there and we're going to continue with our e-fleet rollout, which is sort of a whole different category of service. It's actually lower cost or better performance for our clients, but also lowers our total cost of ownership. And so I would say we're planning to deliver high-quality service and we really don't see any point in burning up equipment with no margins, that's not a good direction. It actually has longer-lasting impacts if surface equipment isn't taken care of. 
Arun Jayaram: Okay, fair enough. And Jeff, I wanted to get your thoughts on offshore. Obviously, one of the trends the market has been observing is just strength in offshore markets. Could you talk about how it's positioned from a product line perspective offshore and what you're seeing perhaps in the Gulf of Mexico to mitigate maybe some of the risk of lower activity in North America? 
A - Jeff Miller: Well look, we're heavily levered towards the offshore business. In fact, all of our service lines participate in our offshore business and we've got leading positions in cementing and HCT. You know our drilling business, we've talked a lot about where we're going with drilling and Wireline and so that's an important business for us. It is higher service intensity, which means that it takes more equipment to do and so we really like that.  I expect the Gulf of Mexico continues to strengthen. And again, we talked about last quarter, sort of the percentage of our offshore international business anyway as a percentage continues to grow. And so I think that the offshore business is going to be very important for Halliburton, and the Gulf of Mexico and all around the world.
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of James West with Evercore ISI. 
James West: Hey! Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Eric.
Jeff Miller: Morning. 
Eric Carre: Good morning, James. 
James West:
-:
Jeff Miller: Look, it's not a perfect science in terms of one-in, one-out, but it’s generally one-in, one-out over time. And so the type of equipment for example that we would retire is typically higher cost to maintain, and so when we retire a fleet, we sort of blow the parts back into the current fleet and that lowers the cost or improves the margins of the existing fleet.  But we're replacing – say replacing – we're adding equipment only as it's demanded by clients, so that's the difference. We're not building it to replace it. We're building it for contracts where there is commitment to return the capital and also the return on capital inside of the contract, and so that's what's driving the pace of replacement. 
James West: Okay, okay, that makes sense. And then on the international and particularly offshore side, as these rigs are mobilizing and getting set up, governments, signing contracts, etc., and the companies your customers are sourcing, the Service Equipment and Service Products, what's the conversation like with them around pricing and kind of – or is there even really much of a concern about pricing, because they just need to get the equipment? 
Jeff Miller: Well, I think that we're seeing pricing moving up, whether it comes in the form of a tender or a dialogue, and a lot of that is around tightness, it's also around efficiency and performance of our equipment. We've just done a lot to structurally overhaul and technically overhaul a lot of our drilling business and I talked a bit about some of the Wireline things that we're doing, so you know. The dialogue is certainly price is up and it comes in a few forms, whether it's a negotiation or a discussion or in some cases we call and say we just don't have it, which is again, driving prices up. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta : Yes, thanks so much. Jeff, maybe I’ll start with you to talk a little bit about return of capital to shareholders and I'll let you go anywhere you want with this. You did buy back $250 million worth of stock in the quarter and you've been pretty steady in terms of that dividend coming back to shareholders as well. As you think about the repurchase program, how aggressive do you intend to be? Do you view this as more of a radical program versus – or an opportunistic one? 
Jeff Miller: Look, I think that we've committed to return at least 50% free cash flow back to shareholders. The reality is it's going to be more than that. I think what we do is we build a base case around what we return to shareholders and then we're able to flex up from that and I think that's you know some of what you're seeing. Eric, do you want to add to that? 
Eric Carre: I think it’s – you covered it well, I think. The – I mean, the main focus in the organization right now is to continue to generate free cash flow. That's really the first priority, and ensure that we have enough and actually we're generating enough free cash flow right now to continue to buyback share, but also to continue to work and further strengthen our balance sheet. So, if we look forward, we intend to do both, even though the buyers right now is clearly on continuing to buy back more shares. 
Neil Mehta : Thanks Eric and the follow up is for you. It's just, I hear you made some comments around this in the script, but any Q3 considerations you want us as a market to keep in mind as we think about and building this sequential model into next quarter.
Eric Carre: No, I think we covered it in the prepared remark and Jeff mentioned it, as well as you look throughout the remainder of the year. I know there's a lot of question on North America, so maybe I'll repeat what we indicated, which is H2 is going to be a little lower than H1 for North America. Q3 is a bit down compared to Q2 and we're expecting Q4 to be flat relative to Q3, considering there were some holidays and seasonality as well. So you combine that with the guidance by division and I think it gives you a really good perspective on how we see the second half of the year unfolding. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. 
Scott Gruber : Yes, I wanted to say on the second half outlook, typically frac activity does slow down into the holiday season. But the gas forward curve is actually quite encouraging today Jeff. As you mentioned in your conversation earlier, the conversations with clients today, are they suggesting that they are going to bring back some gas completion activity later this year or is that more likely to wait until next year, after the budget reset process? 
Jeff Miller: Look, I think that – I'm not going to try to call tops and bottoms, I'll let others do that. But I think that, the outlook I described for 2024 is consistent with what you just described and so when we see that, I don't have precision around the date. But there's no question that gas is firming up and that there'll be LNG takeaway and that the gas market will be busy.  It's a question of the date, but I expect that build in ‘24, could it come sooner? Obviously, it could and I would say oil price is quite constructive today as well, which may bring some smaller players back into the market. But all of these things structurally from a cycle standpoint are very, very positive and as I look at ‘24, sometime between now and there, we see improving activity. 
Scott Gruber : Got it. That makes sense. Yes, and I did want to touch on the oil side as well. Obviously last year well productivity was down and that was starting this conversation around the need just to drill more wells to kind of offset that productivity loss. This year we do seem to be at maybe a localized plateau on well productivity on the oil side in the U.S.  But is that part of the conversation here with customers that you know over time that they are going to have to be drilling more wells in the U.S. given that productivity decline? Is that kind of top of mind as they kind of start to think about ‘24 needs or is that a kind of off the horizon still? 
Jeff Miller: No, I mean let me frame that differently. I think that this is my point around service intensity, meaning it takes more work to produce the same over time unless there are step changes in terms of either efficiency or insight. And so, we talk about our smart fleet offering quite often, but the reality is that's part of our technology portfolio to help customers better understand productivity of rock and where the frac is going and how to design fracs that can be more productive over time, so I think that's an important step.  But there is no question when we think about North America and we even saw that during the COVID when the pace at which North America declined following sort of the near slowdown or near stoppage in North America and so I think those are well understood by the market and our clients.  And so when I think about the way forward in North America, that features in it and is clearly part of our view as to why (a) there'll be more activity over time, even to stand still, and further why e-fleets in our case are so valuable, because they really do help clients achieve better productivity and lower costs. So I think that that's one of the reasons we're so focused on that and I think that's how it plays out. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. 
Luke Lemoine : Hey! Good morning, Jeff and Eric. 
Jeff Miller: Morning, Luke. 
Luke Lemoine : Jeff – Morning! Jeff, nice job on that North America margins in 2Q, I mean those flat, and you talked about those remaining strong for the balance of the year. It kind of sounded like you're not expecting these to be materially different from the first half. Is that correct? 
Jeff Miller: That's correct. 
Luke Lemoine : Okay. And then Eric, 2Q D&E margins for better inter guide. Can you maybe walk us through what changed relative to your expectations? 
Eric Carre: Yes, I think, I mean there's a lot of moving parts in the D&E margins. I think we just delivered better across the board in most product lines and in all of the regions. There's really not a lot more to say about that solid execution from all product lines across the globe. 
Luke Lemoine : Okay, got it. Thanks a bunch. 
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. 
Stephen Gengaro : Hi! Can you hear me? 
Jeff Miller: Yes. 
Eric Carre: Yes. 
Stephen Gengaro : Oh, sorry. I got cut-off. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Two things to me, the first is, we've written and we've heard from others that, the consolidation in the U.S. frac business and then just the better behavior by you and many others has led to a different dynamic in the business. I’m just curious, as you've seen a little bit of obviously rig count softness and frac spreads have come off a bit, are you seeing – can you visibly see any different approach to pricing across the industry yet? Is it too early to tell? Just curious if there's any proof of concepts here yet? 
Jeff Miller: Look, I think there is quite different, and I think it's different along a couple of dimensions. Number one, quite different in the sense of the type of equipment that we are putting into the market with e-fleet. So that's a very different dynamic than we've seen in the past. And I think that the, pull for those from customers is meaningful and so that's one key difference.  And I think from the other perspective, the bifurcation and performance is an important point. And I think that we've seen quite a difference in our performance and that still matters. In fact, that matters a lot. And I think that, sort of the overall – we've always replaced our equipment, invested in our equipment and technology. But I think that, the idea that equipment runs in perpetuity or that it can be run to the ground and then somehow rebuild does not realistic. And so I think there's some understanding around that today that there probably wasn't before. 
Stephen Gengaro : Thank you. And when you – you touched on this a little bit earlier, but when we hear from E&Ps and just industry data in general, that well quality is curating a bit. Is that a net positive you think for the completion side of your business? How do you think about the impact that has or is it kind of too gradual to really jump out? 
Jeff Miller: Yes look, I mean, what that drives is more technology and more service intensity, both. I mean, that's the upshot of what you just described for our customers and we see that. And so we're – you know like you said, I'm quite confident about – I'm confident in North America's contribution to the overall oil and gas supply for the world. It's important and sustaining mass going to require investment and a lot of technology and a lot of just repetitions.  So I think it's not very well for Halliburton. 
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. 
Marc Bianchi : Hi! I just want to ask one more on sort of the North America outlook for the back half. I know it's been asked several times, but just because so many people seem to be focused on that. I think people are surprised by fourth quarter being flat quarter-over-quarter and margins seemingly holding in. Would you anticipate that overall the profit for Halliburton or the EPS should be flat to up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? 
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean, we're not going to guide Q4, but directionally everything is intact. 
Marc Bianchi : Yes. Okay, great. Thanks for that Jeff. The other one I had is just a bit of a modeling question on the corporate line for you, Eric, because we've got this new software element that we need to include. So if I take those two together, the corporate plus the software, it looks like we should be something in the mid-80’s of a negative number and then that should be sort of on a $20 million to $25 million run rate beyond third quarters. Is that the right way to think about that software impact. 
Eric Carre: Yes, I mean we guided the two separately, so as to give you clarity as to what they are. So we guided corporate going into Q3 to be $5 million to $10 million up from Q2, that's essentially a timing issue. We were a bit under guidance in Q2, so that gives you the corporate number. And then in terms of SAP which we guided as a separate line, we guided to $20 million or about $0.02 and what we'll do on that one, we give you the yearly number so $50 million this year, $100 million next year, $100 million the following year, so you can kind of run your models on the yearly basis and then we'll give you more color quarter-to-quarter. Because some of it depends on how the rollout is happening right. So we want to do that on a quarter to quarter basis. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark.
Kurt Hallead: Hey! Good morning Jeff and everybody. Hey Jeff, I'm kind of curious. On the international front right, just are you seeing the prospect of maybe an acceleration in an activity whether that be in the Middle East or Latin America, maybe relative to the beginning part of the year.  I know that there is some questions about the OPEC production cuts, and that may be having a negative impact on activity. But I'm kind of curious as to whether that – you know there's a situation in the Middle East where there's a greater sense of urgency and maybe a push to move some projects a little more quickly. 
Jeff Miller: OPEC cuts absolutely do not have an impact on activity. I’m being crystal clear around that. These are customers with plans that are meeting global demand and it is unrelated to cuts and OPEC.  I would say that the growth, I wouldn't describe it as an acceleration, I would describe it as continued growth, and that's very positive. That's a good thing, because that's consistent with the long duration nature of this cycle. So it's not a spike to come at some point in time in the future to then level out. I think what we're going to continue to see is steady growth in activity, kind of like we've seen. Although does the pace pick up? It might some in fits and starts as big projects get started.  But I think overall, this is a great setup for Halliburton in terms of timing and pacing and absolutely consistent with how we see the length of the cycle. Meaning, it's going to take quite a period of time as barrels are invested in and reinvestment is made. 
Kurt Hallead: Okay, that's great. I appreciate that color. Now, maybe then focusing again on the North American market, you've given some clear deep expectations on what you see there. With the fact that you guys are getting rid of older equipment, focusing on e-fleet, you mentioned a couple of long-term contracts. How do you see the prospects for Halliburton to continue to outpace the market if the market is just going to be flat? 
Jeff Miller: Well, I think I've described what we're going to do and I think that sort of the – we’re focused on what we're doing in terms of – you mentioned e-fleet, but that's an important thing, and that's an important opportunity for Halliburton, it's somewhat unique for Halliburton.  I also believe that it's – as I look out into the future, as I said I see, we talked to extensively about service intensity and technology and I think both of those are going to be very high demand as we get into ’24, and I would say for what we do, it's an high demand now. And so you know, I think the long term for North America clearly points towards what we do uniquely at Halliburton and so I feel pretty confident about that. 
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. 
Jeff Miller : Yes, thank you and thank you all for participating in today's call. Let me close out the call with this. Halliburton delivered an impressive first half of 2023 and I fully expect that the execution of our strategy in this long duration up cycle will deliver better returns, more free cash flow and more cash to shareholders.  I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Please close out the call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-25 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the First Quarter 2023 Halliburton Company Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
David Coleman : Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton first quarter 2023 conference call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available on Halliburton's website after this call.  Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings.  We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller : Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton's performance in the first quarter again demonstrated the earnings power of our strategy, strong competitive position and execution for our customers. Here are some highlights from the first quarter. Total company revenue increased 33% compared to the first quarter of 2022 with strong activity in both North America and international markets. Operating income grew 91% year-over-year.  Operating margin was 17%, a strong start to the year and 530 basis points over the first quarter of last year. International revenue grew 23% year-over-year with strong activity in all markets. North America revenue grew 44% year-over-year with growth across every basin. The Completion and Production division posted 20% margins, an increase of nearly 700 basis points year-over-year. The Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 17% year-on-year while margins expanded more than 100 basis points. Before we continue, I'd like to recognize the employees of Halliburton for their outstanding execution on every dimension of our business. safety, service quality and financial results. The work you do each day matters to our customers and shareholders. Thank you. I'll start with a few comments on the macro. Everything I see today validates the strength and duration of this multiyear upcycle. The world requires more energy from all sources, including oil and gas, driven by population growth and economic development.  Multiple years of structural underinvestment in oil and gas supply can only be addressed by strong activity over the next several years. The commodity price volatility experienced in the first quarter does not change our view of customer demand and a tight services market. Our customers around the world recognize this, and we expect their spending to grow in 2023 and beyond. Further, we expect much of this investment will be directed towards development activity, which is great for Halliburton as it drives outsized demand for our products and services. My view of this up cycle is confirmed by what I hear from our customers and see in the world's oil and gas markets. The Halliburton outlook for both the current year and the long term is strong. Now let's start with our performance in the international markets.  Our revenue in the first quarter grew 23% compared to the same period of last year, reflecting strong activity in all regions. Halliburton executed its strategy to deliver profitable international growth through leading technology offerings, improved pricing and disciplined capital allocation. I expect international spending to grow high teens for the year 2023, with most new activity coming from the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. I am confident in this outlook because we have a strong pipeline of awards that will commence later this year and beyond. Our completion tool order book grew 40% year-on-year in the first quarter, which generally represents work delivered within the current year. And finally, pricing continues to trend up for all product lines in all regions. I'm excited about all segments of our international business. Today, I'd like to provide more color on our offshore business. We generated nearly 45% of our international revenue in the first quarter from our offshore business.  Here are a few examples of differentiated technologies that drive a higher level of performance, service quality and reliability for our customers. Halliburton's intelligent drilling and logging while drilling platforms, iCruise and iStar in combination with LOGIX, our automation platform, delivered the longest reservoir section in a single run for a customer offshore Norway. Our latest wireline imaging technology, STRATA Examiner, delivered high resolution, borehole imaging data, allowing a customer to increase reserve estimates during a recent exploration campaign in the Mediterranean Sea. Halliburton's digital solutions allow our customers to reduce cost per barrel and increase efficiencies. Hess, Repsol and Petrobras, all recently selected Halliburton Landmark's DecisionSpace 365 applications powered by iEnergy Cloud. Our trusted science and machine learning algorithms enable customers to optimize subsurface, well construction and production-related decisions. Cognitive Halliburton's offshore automated cementing system delivers cement jobs remotely with minimal human direction and intervention. More than 30 cement jobs were completed this quarter in the North Sea alone.  Finally, I'm excited about the progress of our TechnipFMC alliance on all electric completions. I believe this technology will over time, substantially change the cost and performance of deepwater completions and subsea infrastructure. As I look at 2023 and beyond, I am excited about our international business. Our customers are clearly motivated to produce more oil and gas. Service capacity is tight and pricing is increasing. Our differentiated technologies and our execution drive margin improvements and growth across our international business. Turning to North America. As I expected, Halliburton achieved strong results despite volatile commodity prices. We delivered on our strategic priority to maximize value in North America through capital efficiency, differentiated technology and alignment with high-quality customers. I know it's on your minds. So let me briefly discuss the natural gas markets. First, I firmly believe that the gas market softness will be solved the 6 billion cubic feet per day of additional LNG export capacity comes online in the next 24 months. Second, in response to market conditions, we are moving 3 fleets from gas basins to oil basins to satisfy specific customer demands.  Finally, we retired 1 Tier 2 diesel fleet which will reduce our near-term maintenance costs and accelerate Halliburton's transition to e-fleets. These actions reduced our gas market exposure by about 30% and maintain financial returns. I reiterate my expectation that North America customer spending will grow at least 15% in 2023. At today's oil prices, I believe that our customers will execute their activity plans and the market for highly efficient equipment and quality services will remain tight. Our strategy is to maximize value in North America. Let me be crystal clear about what that looks like. First, we improved the performance and utilization of our existing fleet and we align with high-quality customers who value our operational efficiency and consistent execution. Here's what the customers are telling me. Halliburton's performance is different, not only better than your competitors, but even better than your own past performance.  Our step change in performance, safety and operational efficiency comes from our investments in new technologies, crew training and process improvements. As a result, today, we see a 60% improvement in pumping utilization across our entire North America land fleet since 2019. Second, we only deploy service capacity to attractive return opportunities. We are always finding ways to improve average fleet returns.  Finally, we invest in differentiated products and services that improve margins and asset velocity. Our patented Zeus e-fleet and SmartFleet are examples they maximize asset values for our customers and structurally improve returns for Halliburton. Our Zeus e-fleets continue to outperform for our customers and smart fleet adoption is accelerating. We delivered about 6x more smart fleet stages in the first quarter than a year ago. Halliburton's position and outlook in North America is strengthened by the uptake and contract duration of our e-fleets. The contracting structure for e-fleets, which we only deploy on multiyear contracts and our technology road map for the future, create structural strength in Halliburton's North America business. Halliburton's e-fleet technology is proven to deliver better performance, lower total cost of ownership and increased operating efficiency.  For customers with the mandate to produce barrels over the long term, and maximize the value of their investment dollars, the attraction to e-fleets is self-evident. To summarize, I believe Halliburton is uniquely positioned to deliver financial outperformance, our strong execution culture, differentiated technology portfolio and collaborative approach with customers give us a strong competitive advantage. I am confident that we will execute our strategic priorities and deliver shareholder returns by maximizing value in North America, delivering profitable international growth and driving capital efficiency. Before I turn it over to Eric, I'd like to leave you with 2 financial points. First, given my outlook, I expect the execution of our strategy will deliver significant and growing free cash flow. Second, while our previously announced capital return framework provides a minimum of 50% free cash flow back to shareholders, it also gives us the flexibility to return more cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. Everything I see today points towards more cash to shareholders.  Now I'll turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?
Eric Carre : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, a 33% increase over the first quarter of last year while operating income was $977 million, an increase of 91% year-over-year. Operating margin for the company was 17.2% in the first quarter which is an increase of 530 basis points over the first quarter of 2022. These results were primarily driven by increased global activity, improved pricing and strong seasonal product and software sales. Our first quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.72, which more than doubled from the same period last year. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in the first quarter was $3.4 billion, a 45% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 while operating income was $666 million, an increase of 125% when compared to the first quarter of 2022. C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20%, driven by increased activity, improved pricing and service efficiency in North America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the first quarter was $2.3 billion, an increase of 17% when compared to the first quarter of 2022, while operating income was $369 million an increase of 26% when compared to the first quarter of 2022. D&E delivered an operating income margins of 16% and driven by strong wireline, testing and drilling-related services globally and an uptick in international activity. Now let's move on to geographic results. Our first quarter international revenue increased 23% year-over-year due to solid product sales, activity increases and pricing gains across multiple product lines. In North America, revenue in the first quarter was $2.8 billion, a 44% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022. This increase was primarily driven by increased stimulation activity and efficiencies, higher activity across our well construction product lines in North America land as well as higher activity across multiple product lines in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue in the first quarter was $915 million, a 40% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to increased well construction services and stimulation activity in Mexico and Argentina, and higher completion tool sales across the region. Europe Africa revenue in the first quarter was $662 million, a 2% decrease when compared to the first quarter of 2022 as a result of the sale of our Russian operations, along with decreased activity across multiple product service lines in Norway. This decrease was partially offset by increased well construction services and stimulation activity throughout Africa. Middle East Asia revenue in the first quarter was $1.3 billion, a 30% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2022 primarily due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, higher completion tool sales, improved well construction services and increased project management activity across the region. Now I'd like to cover some additional financial items. In the first quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $58 million. For the second quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to be up about $5 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $79 million. For the second quarter, we expect this expense to be about flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $69 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For the second quarter, we expect this expense to decline approximately $15 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in at approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to increase about 50 basis points. Capital expenditure for the first quarter were $268 million. We anticipate that our remaining capital expenditures will increase quarter-over-quarter into the end of the year and total capital expenditures to be approximately 6% of our revenue for the full year. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $122 million, and free cash flow was a use of $105 million. These results were primarily driven by seasonal investments in working capital. As is typical for our business, we anticipate our cash flow will be back-end loaded for the year. We expect to generate strong free cash flow for the rest of 2023. As a step toward achieving Halliburton's capital return policy of returning at least 50% of annual free cash flow to shareholders, we repurchased approximately $100 million of common stock during the first quarter. Finally, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect the seasonal revenue decline in software sales to be partially offset by further improvements in global drilling activity. As a result, we anticipate sequential D&E revenue to increase low to mid-single digits and margins to decline 50 to 100 basis points. In the Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to increase low to mid-single digits and margins to improve 25 to 75 basis points.  I will now turn the call back to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton's performance in the first quarter demonstrated the earnings power of our strategy. My outlook for Halliburton is strong. I expect international year-on-year growth in the high teens North America growth in excess of 15%. And finally, everything I see today points towards more cash to shareholders. And now let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Anderson with Barclays.
Dave Anderson : So let's just get right into it. Despite the strong numbers you put up in North America this quarter and the guide for second quarter, we kind of firmed up everything. The bear case has been heating up during the quarter with the rig count softening a bit. A&P suggesting pricing is poised to come down. On the other hand, we're hearing from you, other service companies that you don't see this slowdown. In fact, prices continue to rise. I wonder if you help kind of help us start up the disconnect here. Does the difference line to customer mix? I know you highlighted the gas market and particularly weak. Is the differentiation of equipment just a lot of rhetoric keep during the quarter. I'm just wondering how we should be thinking about your U.S. land activity and the pricing trends in the second half.
Jeff Miller: Yes. Well, thanks, Dave. Look, prices aren't moving down. And I think from our comments, I've told you what we've done and what we plan to do. Overall margin improvement comes from structurally bifurcated market, as you described, demand for high-quality services are very much in demand and hard to deliver. And quite frankly, the cost of the frac hasn't changed. I mean the engines are moving up. There's still inherent inflation in the frac business today. So there's not a connection there. And so as I look out at the rest of the year, we continue to improve the earnings power of our fleet through bifurcation, delivery of these fleets, retirement of -- it needs to be retired, be clear, not stacked, but retired. And then finally, efficiency and sort of repositioning around better pricing.
Dave Anderson : But pricing in your mind, continues to move higher. And I would assume that pricing from last year still continue to roll through your fleets?
Jeff Miller: I would say on average. Yes.
Dave Anderson : And if I could just shift gears over on the international side, your Middle East business doesn't get a ton of credit on the street, despite actually being just as big as kind of 1 of your bigger peers on a relative sense, I was wondering if you could talk about how you see the pace of activity progressing this year in the Middle East. Are you still ramping up on contracts? I think you had kind of alluded to that in your prepared remarks, but what is -- also what is your outlook on tenders in the Middle East this year? And I guess, finally, should we expect to see a lift in D&E margins next year based upon what you're seeing in pricing activity levels this year in the Middle East?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, pricing is improving. And so -- and I would expect D&E margins to improve along with that. I would still argue early innings of activity increase in the Middle East I'm pleased with our growth. So thank you for pointing that out. But I see this continuing rig counts aren't necessarily at near peak. And I think we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to run. And then broadly, international, it's beyond the Middle East, pleased with the growth that we saw in the first quarter. And just a reminder to to everyone that in Q1 of '22, Russia was 2% of our business. And so that's really pretty strong growth.
Operator: We have a question from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan.
Arun Jayaram: Jeff, just digesting service prints and outlooks thus far, we are seeing or observing more resilient conditions in U.S. frac versus drilling. I wanted to get your thoughts on why do you think this is the case? And how do you see things playing out in terms of your drilling-related segments at Sperry in North America over the balance of the year?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, I think wells drilled in North America really a function of DUC count. So as the DUCs get drawn down, more wells have to be drilled. And so I think fluctuation in drilling. And it's interesting that you see fluctuation in drilling, but a very steady march in terms of frac. And I think some of that is managing cost at the margin. but the fact is they don't produce more without fracking wells. And so I'm not surprised to see that. I think our D&E business in North America remains strong. confident on what we're seeing there. We continue to sort of make gains in the drilling part of the business. And I would say the other service lines are very strong.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Great. And just my follow-up, Jeff, you mentioned that you have some sort of relationship with FTI on the electric side. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some more details on that partnership?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, this is an opportunity to mine what the 2 companies really do well. And they're particularly areas where we overlap, and we're taking advantage of that. We've been working on a series of things and 1 of which is all electric completions for about 5 years is -- and we just signed up for another 5 years with TSMC. So great partner in this area. What we've delivered ultimately will be, I think, a revolutionary all-electric solution. They really only -- it takes the 2 of us to solve for, it's not the bulk of either 1 of our businesses. But the fact is in this narrow space, we bring some really unique synergies and opportunity to develop technology. And so very pleased with the relationship and the progress that we're making up to and including we're jointly marketing and selling some solutions today.
Operator: Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: So Jeff, I know you spend, guys, probably 60-plus percent of your time on the road seeing customers and a lot of that -- the majority of that internationally could you maybe describe the customer conversations at this point where they are with their sense of urgency, where the pushback is, if any, with pricing? Or is there more concern about availability is kind of how we're thinking about the cycle as it takes off from here. And just curious to hear what you're hearing on the ground.
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, James. The discussion is more around availability than anything else. Whether it's services that we provide capital more importantly, availability of tools and people. And a lot of the planning, we're even doing planning today -- I mean, deep planning today for '24 activity that we expect to ramp up and so there's enough concern around availability in '24 that significant resources are committed now to solving for that. So I've got a lot of confidence in the runway internationally and the amount of work that we've won.
James West: Okay. That's great. That's good to hear. And then on North America, the 15% plus growth that you're anticipating in forecasting for this year -- is there -- how much -- I guess, could you describe how much of that you think is just kind of the pure inflation in the market, whether it's rig rates or fractured costs, that kind of stuff versus rig count or activity led growth?
Jeff Miller: Yes, James. It's -- I think it's a combination of the 2 and certainly the more activity you have, the more sort of replacing type you see. But if I just sort of look back to look forward, if I take last year, 5% production growth last year, year-on-year translated into about 50% revenue growth for us. I know in '23, the outlook is for, let's say, 3 production growth. And I think published estimates at least today around operator CapEx or 17% or so. I think it says a couple of things. Number one, producing oil doesn't get easier, meaning it demands more of our services and higher quality services. And so I'm confident that we're going to maximize value in North America. And I think that combination of activity and and price is what delivers the north of 15%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: Congrats on the quarter there. Just a couple of things to follow up on, Jeff. Your comment in the opening about 45% of your international coming from offshore and obviously talking a little bit about planning for '24, which greater visibility on offshore, a lot of times than others. I was just curious how you see that potentially changing. Does it increase as a percentage of mix? And how should we think about that in terms of enhanced visibility, top line growth and maybe margin expansion?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. Look, I'm pleased with the growth on a percentage basis of our position in offshore or the amount of offshore work that we're doing. Look, I think it continues to grow and I expect our position as we continue to bring out the types of technologies I talked about continue to help drive our growth in offshore work. And so we are levered heavily to offshore, and this is all service lines or levered to offshore. And I think that as we see that business grow, I expect, yes, it does translate into top line growth and margin growth. And I think that what's clear though, also is it higher service intensity, but it also requires more equipment to do offshore work. So it has a bit of a double effect in terms of growing revenues and margins, but it also tightens up the rest of the business by virtue of consuming backup tools and additional shifts of people. And so as offshore grows, that has a tightening effect really on everything, which again, helps to drive better margins and better growth.
Roger Read: Okay. And then mine related follow-up on that. You mentioned the Smart frac had picked up quite a bit in the U.S. I think it was up 6x roughly versus a year ago. Any thoughts to what that growth rate is going forward? And should we anticipate sort of any change in terms of margins as that goes forward, positive, negative or unchanged?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, I think that, that growth continues at sort of that pace. This is 1 of those solutions that is very affordable and scalable and provides important data to operators particularly as the focus becomes productivity per foot. And so this is really the best way, maybe the only way to meaningfully measure where the sand goes. And as a result of that, that's the building block of what produces more of what's better complexity, where is the sand, what's the most efficient solution. And so I expect that continues to grow at a very fast pace and we've continued to introduce more technology around that solution so that it's easier to deploy and ultimately -- this is 1 of those things that our target is to be the most efficient solution in the marketplace. And as it scales, it becomes more valuable to us and in my view, it's a very sticky solution because it's 1 of those things that once you have that data, and it becomes part of a working process, then it becomes very sticky over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta : First question is about the comments about moving 3 frac fleets from gas to oil basins. Can you talk about whether you see more potential for this to happen? What are some of the switching costs associated with that? And is this the beginning of a greater trend?
Jeff Miller: Well, look, I think what we demonstrated is that's what we're going to do. Clearly, gas economics are challenged today. And I don't think it's something that service prices solve. And so I think gas is incredibly important, and I expect that it continues. But -- and even get stronger as we build into the LNG capacity that gets built here in the U.S. But along the way, we see opportunities for unmet demand in oil, and we've made the moves we described. We also want to accelerate our fleet as a percentage of our overall fleet, which requires that we retire fleets along the way. And so from our perspective, that is the path that we take. Now I think it's -- gas operators are continuing to operate, and they are working and really to that end, actually just placed an e-fleet into a gas basin with an operator. So there's clearly an outlook that gas recovers.
Neil Mehta : And then can you talk about the return of capital comments. You had mentioned you could see a scenario where you go in excess of the 50% of free cash flow back to shareholders. So Talk about how you're thinking about using the buyback as a tool to create value.
Jeff Miller: Well, as I described, our outlook is strong. I expect we generate a lot of free cash flow. And yes, I believe that as we do that, we'll be able to return more cash to shareholders. And so we took a step in Q1. But obviously, the ability to the flex there is going to be with share buybacks.
Operator: We have a question from Scott Gruber from Citi.
Scott Gruber: Just to understand that same line of inquiry given the appetite to go above the 50% threshold, Jeff, is there an appetite to pursue buybacks with bigger here near term when the stock is is quite attractively priced? Or do you wait until the cash flows show up later this year and risk buying at a higher price if the fundamentals stay tied as you foresee?
Eric Carre: Yes, Scott, it's Eric. So generally speaking, how we think about cash returns today is -- I mean, obviously, we just raised the dividend. We intend to continue to do small bolt-on acquisition, technology-driven type acquisition, continue to chip at the debt as well as we go along. But clearly, today, the bias is towards increasing buyback as we go through the year. So yes, directionally, that's correct.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And then an unrelated follow-up. I'm just looking at your year-on-year incrementals in D&E, and they appear quite strong. And I would guess this is largely driven by operating leverage and mix around offshore and technology, just given previous commentary. And I would guess pricing is less impactful today at this juncture with potentially more of a price contribution in the years ahead. Is that a fair assessment? Or is pricing having a significant impact here already in 2Q if you look year-on-year at D&E margins?
Jeff Miller: Well, pricing certainly has improved year-on-year. But I think more importantly is the the depth of the technology that we're introducing is sort of the duration. And I don't want to get away from that. It's not a point in time. I think we've got pricing improving, but at the same time, we've got substantial capital efficiency happening also in terms of the technology. So the -- we've been pretty clear about the technology that we are investing in is driving capital efficiency, which means that we capture more of the value and cash flow over time. And so I would expect to see the margin improvement that you saw this quarter year-on-year to continue in terms of incrementals. And I say it that way. I've always said that our expectation is that we stack improvement each quarter in terms of margins in D&E. And expect that to continue to happen. Obviously, there's some intra-year cyclicality. But I think the key is if we look at each year by quarter, then we ought to be stacking improvements quarter-on-quarter. And I think we've got a long runway ahead of us in D&E.
Scott Gruber: But it just sounds like it's more of the kind of structural investments you made around technology and driving your asset turns and mix more than pricing today. Is that fair, Jeff?
Jeff Miller: Yes, I think that is reasonable to say.
Operator: We have a question from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Chase Mulvehill : Jeff. I guess maybe if we can kind of hit on free cash flow. If we think about your outlook, your North America outlook was maintained. And it looks like you kind of bumped up your international outlook so I'm guessing that it would probably imply a bump to your free cash flow outlook. I think last quarter, you said free cash flow should grow at least 20%, which seemed conservative when you gave it so with a better international outlook and still maintain North America. Any updates on how we should be thinking about 2023 free cash flow?
Eric Carre: Yes, This -- it's Eric. So directionally, as you said, we're very confident in the outlook of the business, the kind of profile of free cash flow. Typically, we're going to start generating meaningful free cash flow in Q2 and in H2 as we're done with the buildup of working capital we did in Q1. And directionally, -- you're right. Our outlook right now is more north of 30%, then it was 20% in Q1. So yes, we're revising our projections up.
Chase Mulvehill : Okay. Awesome. And then unrelated follow-up, you highlighted a lot of digital wins in your press release and also in your prepared remarks today. So question around this, and are you starting to see more digital adoption by your customers? And if so, what's been the catalyst for accelerated adoption I'm going to give this 1 to try and in any chance that you could speak to how material digital revenues are today for Halliburton?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I think the adoption is going to always be around business cases and what creates value for customers. And I think the idea that we're just going to go digital has started and stopped because it was proven unsuccessful. And so what we see is now more meaningful adoption around real solutions, software solutions and automation solutions -- it is a big business, but it's not one -- it's one that's sort of spread throughout the business as well. And so I think that we tend to think about it in 2 buckets. We tend to think about it as software is 1 activity and automation as another. And both are generated sort of from the same technical capacity by that, I mean the capacity to do software at scale, a lot of that resident and Landmark, the software business sort of being 1 thing and then the automation, which is many of the same tools maybe buy differently throughout the rest of the business. And it has a meaningful effect on our performance margin outlook, it's going to have -- it will continue to do that. Even in our offshore in the drilling business in terms of automation of the drilling tools can do and probably equally onshore North America in terms of what we can do with frac fleets from a maintenance and performance standpoint. It's not something we necessarily advertise, but it's very inherent in the type of performance and efficiency that we see today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.
Luke Lemoine: Jeff you reached your international growth outlook this year from at least mid-teens to high teens. Can you unpack this a little bit? And maybe just talk about what's changed, what's accelerating and what you have more confidence in?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I think I have more confidence in number -- well, really 3 things. One, the indicators that we're looking at things like completion tool order book, which has grown meaningfully and that all focuses on this year. I would say, pricing sort of improvement that we're seeing, pricing and tightness around equipment around the world internationally is another meaningful one. And then finally, just we're winning awards and we're growing. We're selective about the awards we're winning. Again, our strategy is profitable international growth. emphasizing the profit part of that statement. But at the same time, we are seeing success and we're seeing success in a lot of different markets. And so because of that, we see a path to sort of high teens.
Luke Lemoine: Got it. Good deal. And then maybe on the geo market, you touched on the Middle East growth earlier, but could you expand on what you're seeing in Asia and Latin America for the balance of the year?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I'm seeing Asia, again, pick up, particularly in terms of development type work, which is obviously right there in our wheelhouse. And then also in Latin America, clearly, we see activity growth in Brazil. But really throughout the region, we see the imperative to produce more oil and gas. And clearly, oil and gas is an important part of the economies of Latin America. And so there's a lot of motivation to be more effective and to deliver more oil and gas, partly for economic reasons and for tax revenues. But I think I'm really encouraged by what we see.
Operator: We have a question from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel.
Stephen Gengaro: So curious, when we look at U.S. pressure pumping world, a lot of the competitors have expanded services at the well site. I mean going through all things from vertical integration to well site integration. How are you seeing it from your eyes as far as how it impacts how, how it impacts pricing and your profitability in the business at the wellsite.
Jeff Miller: Well, we view all of this very strategically in the sense of we're looking at returns, long-term returns and where we create value in terms of competitive advantage. And so we don't -- vertical integration for the sake of vertical integration, in my view, is not necessarily creating more value, what we're doing in the frac space and really, in every business that we're in is focused on where do we create technical differentiation. So what our creates competitive advantage for Halliburton. And so when I think about what we've done with electric fleets, what we've done with the smart fleet really meaningful things. The inputs to the business are the inputs to the business and those are may be good businesses for others. But there are places where we create competitive advantage. So for that reason, it's not just how much volume can we capture around the wellbore. It's really where can we capture volume and create competitive advantage. And so I like where we are in our approach to it.
Stephen Gengaro: And then just as a quick follow-up, are you seeing tightness in sand? And is that a profit center for you and any material movements in that over the last couple of quarters?
A –Jeff Miller: No. Not a lot of movement in the last few quarters. And again, I view it like all inputs to our business. It’s going to fluctuate at different times, different levels. There’s a lot of sand in the world, and it’s quite available. So I don’t view that as a long-term impediment to anything that we’re trying to do just given the availability and really how to go about producing it.
Operator: And that's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Jeff Miller for any closing remarks.
Jeff Miller : Yes. Thank you, and thank you all for participating in today's call. Let me close out the call with just a couple of comments. First, Halliburton's performance in the first quarter demonstrated the earnings power of our strategy. And then secondly, my outlook for Halliburton is strong and everything I see today points towards more cash to shareholders. I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Let's close out the call. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-01-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2022 Halliburton Company Earnings Conference Call [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
David Coleman: Hello, and thank you for joining the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. We will make the recording of today's webcast available on Halliburton's Web site after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, Executive Vice President and CFO. Some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly update any forward-looking statement for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our Web site. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Halliburton finished the year strong with solid financial and operational performance in both divisions and both hemispheres. Halliburton's execution in 2022 demonstrates the earnings power of our strategy, and I expect this earnings power to strengthen in 2023 and beyond. Let's jump right into the 2022 highlights. We delivered full year total company revenue of $20.3 billion and operating income of $2.7 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 70% compared to 2021 with improved margin performance in both divisions. Our full year international revenue grew 20% over 2021, and our revenue and operating income increased each quarter in 2022. I am pleased with the international growth and margin progression Halliburton demonstrated this year despite a second quarter exit from our Russian business. Our full year North America revenue increased 51% over 2021 with improved margins driven by activity and pricing gains. Both our drilling and evaluation and completion and production divisions grew revenue and margins this year. The Drilling and Evaluation division generated full year operating margins of 15%, an increase of 320 basis points over 2021. The steady expansion of D&E margins demonstrates the global competitiveness of our D&E business. Our Completion and Production division posted 18% full year operating margins, a year-over-year increase of 290 basis points, driven by activity and pricing improvements. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.4 billion, retired $1.2 billion of debt, maintained capital spending within 5% to 6% of revenues and ended the year with $2.3 billion of cash on hand. Finally, our service quality performance excelled in 2022. Nonproductive time improved by 7% over 2021, which drove the highest ever uptime across our business. Execution is at the heart of who we are and our results are a testament to our employees' continued commitment to superior service quality. I'm pleased with the fourth quarter results. Revenue grew 4% and operating income grew 15% sequentially. Margins increased in both C&P and D&E divisions and in both hemispheres. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $1.2 billion and free cash flow was $856 million. Building on the strong foundation of execution, today, I am pleased to announce the following shareholder return actions: first, our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share in the first quarter of 2023, representing a 33% increase from last year; second, we have resumed share buybacks under our existing Board authorization of approximately $5 billion and in the fourth quarter of 2022, bought back shares totaling $250 million; finally, our Board approved a capital return framework that we expect going forward to return at least 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. These actions demonstrate Halliburton's confidence in our business, customers, employees and industry outlook. Before we continue, I want to take a moment and thank the Halliburton employees around the world who made these results possible. Our success this quarter and throughout 2022 was a direct result of your hard work and dedication. I thank you for your relentless focus on safety, operational execution, customer collaboration and service quality performance. Now let's turn to the macro outlook where everything I see today points towards continued oil and gas tightness. On the supply side, in the US, an increased spend of almost 50% and activity growth of nearly 30% yielded a production increase of about 5%. Given the increased spend required to grow and replace production, I expect activity to remain strong and service intensity to increase through 2023. I see the same supply side challenges in the international markets. One indicator being that despite OPEC's 2022 production quotas, several members did not meet their goals. On the demand side, we saw the resilience of oil and gas demand throughout 2022, even as central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. I expect oil and gas demand to remain strong. As we start 2023, I also expect China's reopening to further increase demand. It's clear to me that oil and gas is in short supply and only multiple years of increased investment in both stemming declines and reserve additions will solve short supply. I believe these investments will drive demand for oilfield services for the next several years. The unique feature of this up cycle, as I see it, is the investor driven return discipline by both operators and service companies, which I expect drives a longer duration cycle and translates into years of increasing demand for Halliburton services. Now let's turn to Halliburton, starting with our performance in the international markets. We successfully executed our strategy to deliver profitable international growth through competitive technology offerings, improved pricing and selective contract wins. International revenue grew 20% year-on-year with strong growth and margin expansion from both divisions. This gives me confidence in the earnings power of our international strategy. In 2023, we expect international activity to grow at least mid-teens with most new activity coming from the Middle East and Latin America. As this up cycle continues, I believe that we will see substantial growth in all international markets, both onshore and offshore, led by development activity and increased spend at the wellbore. This is excellent news for Halliburton. About half our revenue comes from international markets. We have leading positions in key well construction product lines and a strong geographic footprint. I'm excited about the growth and profit opportunities that will come with the adoption of our new drilling technology platforms. Our iCruise drilling technology, iStar logging while drilling platform and LOGIX automation capabilities. Each of these technologies are in different stages of implementation, and we are already seeing benefits. Our iCruise directional drilling system represents about half of our rotary steerable fleet while drilling about 70% of our global footage. It is a key contributor to increasing international profitability. Our iStar logging while drilling platform now delivers high definition measurements closer to the bit and deeper into the formation. While early in its rollout with only 600,000 feet logged, the iStar platform directly complements the iCruise directional drilling system. Finally, LOGIX automates drilling with iCruise and iStar. With more than 7 million feet drilled in 20 plus countries the LOGIX platform reduces operational risk and delivers wells reliably. Turning to North America. We had a terrific year. Our performance demonstrated our strategy to maximize value in North America through capital efficiency, improved pricing, differentiated technology and alignment with high quality customers. In 2022, our North America revenue grew 51% year-over-year, while revenue in the fourth quarter was flat sequentially due to weather related downtime late in the year. Looking ahead, we expect strong activity and anticipate customer spending to grow by at least 15% in 2023. The market for equipment is tight. Lead times for new and replacement equipment remain long and service companies remain disciplined. Our completions calendar is fully booked and pricing continues to improve across all product service lines. Against this constructive market backdrop, Halliburton will outperform with our unique strategy to maximize value. We see strong demand for our Zeus e-fleets with several repeat customers contracting additional fleets. Zeus is a proven design with a strong operational track record. Our new automated fracturing platform, Optiv, fully automates equipment operation, reduces maintenance and extends component life. We are in the early innings of this rollout, having proven it over 15,000 stages, and I expect it to drive higher capital efficiency. Finally, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system is gaining significant traction with customers. SmartFleet data helps customers answer key questions such as the existence of flow barriers, well interference, parent-child performance and depletion, all to improve completion performance. These are a few examples of how technology maximizes value in North America. Each example delivers better margins either by reducing capital cost or increasing capital velocity and in many cases, both. Halliburton is unique and is the only integrated services company to have a strong presence in both North America and international markets, a strong execution culture and differentiated technology. We will continue to sharpen our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. I am confident in Halliburton's strong long term outlook. This is the best setup and market outlook for oilfield services om Halliburton that I have seen in a very long time. Our exceptional financial performance this year is a clear result of the execution of our strategic priorities to maximize value in North America, deliver profitable international growth and drive capital efficiency. I expect Halliburton to continue to deliver financial outperformance. Now I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our financial results. Eric?
Eric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.6 billion, a 4% increase over the third quarter while operating income was $976 million, an increase of 15% over third quarter operating income. Operating margin for the company was 17.5% in the fourth quarter, a 460 basis point increase over operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2021. These results were primarily driven by increased global activity, pricing and year end product and software sales. Our fourth quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.72, an increase of $0.12 or 20% from the third quarter. Our 2022 full year adjusted net income per diluted share nearly doubled from 2021. Beginning with our Completion and Production division. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.2 billion, a 1% increase when compared to the third quarter, while operating income was $659 million, an increase of 13% when compared to the third quarter. Despite weather related downtime late in the year, C&P delivered an operating income margin of 20.7%, the highest operating income margin since 2012. This was due to improved pricing, service efficiency and activity mix in North America land as well as increased activity in international markets. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.4 billion, an increase of 8% when compared to the third quarter, while operating income was $387 million, an increase of 19% when compared to the third quarter. These results were driven by higher year end software sales and an uptick in international activity. Operating margin increased 210 basis points above Q4 2021, which demonstrates the global competitiveness of our D&E business. Moving on to geographic results. Our international revenue increased 9% sequentially due to solid year end sales, pricing gains and activity increases. In North America, revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.6 billion, a 1% decrease when compared to the third quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by weather related downtime in North America land. Latin America revenue in the fourth quarter was $945 million, a 12% increase sequentially due to higher activity in Mexico and across the region. Europe/Africa revenue in the fourth quarter was $657 million, a 3% increase sequentially driven by higher completion tool sales, drilling activity and well intervention services across the region. These increases were partially offset by lower activity in Norway. Middle East/Asia revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion, a 10% increase sequentially, primarily resulting from higher software sales and drilling and evaluation services across the region. Now I'd like to cover some additional financial items. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expenses was $70 million. For the first quarter, we expect our corporate expenses to be slightly lower. Net interest expense for the quarter was $74 million, a slight decrease due to higher yields on cash balances and debt retirement in September. For the first quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Other net expense for the quarter was $60 million, primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements. For the first quarter, we expect this expense to be slightly lower. Our normalized effective tax rate for the fourth quarter came in at approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our first quarter effective tax rate to increase roughly 150 basis points. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $350 million with our 2022 full year CapEx totaling approximately $1 billion. Turning to cash flow. For the full year, we generated $2.2 billion of cash from operations and delivered approximately $1.4 billion of free cash flow. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $2.3 billion in cash. Next, I'd like to provide a few more details about our capital return framework. First, an important pillar of our capital framework is to maintain CapEx between 5% and 6% of revenue. I believe the spending level is appropriate and supports our earnings growth and free cash flow generation over the next several years. Second, we expect to return a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 33% to $0.16 per share, effective with a dividend payment in March 2023. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased $250 million of shares and we have remaining authorization of approximately $5 billion. We were clear about our goals to reduce debt and increased cash returns to shareholders, and I am pleased that we've announced these actions today. I believe Halliburton's capital return framework provides visibility for investors and affords us the flexibility to pursue acquisitions and strengthen the balance sheet. Now let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather related seasonality and the roll-off of year end product sales, which will mostly impact our international business. As a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue to be essentially flat with the fourth quarter while margins will drop between 75 and 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect revenue to decrease in the low to mid single digits sequentially while margins are expected to be down 25 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.
A - Jeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Oil and gas is tight and only multiple years of increased investment will solve short supply, which translates into years of increasing demand for Halliburton Services. The announced dividend increase, share buybacks and Halliburton's new capital return framework provides shareholders with clarity and consistency on how we expect to return cash to shareholders. This exceptional financial performance is a clear result of our execution of Halliburton's strategic priorities. I expect Halliburton to continue to deliver financial outperformance, strong free cash flow and shareholder returns. And now let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Anderson with Barclays.
David Anderson: So Halliburton's international business is now half of overall revenue. Middle East has been a big part of that growth over the years, it was up 10% this quarter. Just wondering if you could just give us a little bit more insight into kind of your views on that market over the next kind of couple of years. So based on activity is how it's trending and the ramp up is going on, I guess, in the near term, is it reasonable to think the growth should sort of stay at these levels the next several quarters? And also, if you could highlight some of the countries where you see most of the growth coming from over the next several years, including kind of where you think you're best positioned in terms of footprints or product lines in the Middle East?
Jeff Miller: Look, I'm really excited about international growth. I think I said in my call, north of 15%, which clearly, I expect it will be north of that and should continue actually to expand, I think, over the next few years just because we will -- it takes longer to get traction internationally, get things contracted. And so really excited about what we see. With our international business being about half of our business today, that indicate or demonstrates that we have strong footprint sort of everywhere where we think it's important and our technology, as I described, rolling out. So clearly, it's got strong application in the Middle East and Latin America, which we kind of saw this year but it's the same technology that's applicable in all corners of the world. And so I think we're early in the rollout a lot of this technology and that's only going to help strengthen our international business. As we see activity grow, I expect our share of that to grow and improve margins as we focus on profitable international growth.
David Anderson: And if I could shift over on the US side, there's been a lot of recent talk about activity levels slowing down in the US. The rig count has drifted down a bit in recent weeks, been some weather, as you highlighted, and there's also some concerns out there in the natural gas market. I also know how any E&Ps have announced any spending budgets this year. So I was wondering if you can just help us out with a little bit of visibility on the market. Kind of what are your customers saying about kind of how activity is going to play out into the spring? And then based on that, kind of how do you see sort of the dynamics of that pressure pumping market in terms of capacity and the tightness for 2023?
Jeff Miller: Look, North America is going to, in my view, will surprise to the upside. Our outlook is north of 15% growth. Clearly, we outpaced that last year and that's what I said last year. I don't have any clients that are not -- that are -- that plan to get smaller, they all plan to grow. And I think that North America has a dynamic of the more -- the more you grow, the more the market has to work in order to maintain even the growth given decline curves. And so I expect we see increased service intensity throughout '23 and likely beyond, the market is extremely tight for frac equipment and the supply chain still backed up. And so I don't see -- I see discipline in the marketplace and more importantly, I see sort of required discipline based on equipment being unavailable. So the more activity we see then ultimately, the more price we will see. And so I am very positive on '23 North America. So I think the the concerns are misplaced and rig count likely moves up actually as DUCs get blown down.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan.
Arun Jayaram: Jeff, clearly, one of the themes this earnings season has been the inflection in Middle East spending in offshore. I was wondering, Jeff, if you could talk about Halliburton's portfolio and competitive position in both the Middle East and as well as offshore? And how do you think you're positioned in this cycle versus last?
Jeff Miller: Look, we're better positioned than we've ever been as Halliburton, both from a technology perspective that I described examples of that. But clearly, that's not all of the technology we've got in the market today and from a footprint standpoint. So a lot of that build out was done prior cycles, it's still there and ready to go. So I feel very good about our geographic footprint, our technology advancement that we've made and our team. I mean we've just got an exceptionally strong team today internationally. So I feel very confident certainly from that perspective. And when we look at where our business is, offshore is good for us. I think that about 40% of our international business is offshore today. And so that's a good market for us. And I think another nuance as we look out into next year, certainly and likely beyond, is the sort of emphasis on development activity as opposed to exploration that maybe we've seen in prior cycles. And I think that's very consistent with where operators are from a capital discipline standpoint and just producing more barrels sooner, which leads us to development. And that is a place where we have leading positions in a number of the service lines that allow that to happen, so meaning drilling fluids, completion tools. And so I think this is going to be a great even better market for Halliburton.
Arun Jayaram: And maybe a follow-up for Eric. Eric, I wanted to get your thoughts on cash conversion in 2023. And just wanted to think about just working capital needs to support the growth this year? And just any broad thoughts on collections, particularly for international -- some of your international and NOC customers?
Eric Carre: So I mean, broadly speaking, we're looking at the cash generation profile in 2023 as being fairly similar to 2022. So quite a bit weighted toward the back half of the year. Looking at things overall, I mean, the big buckets, obviously, we'll see significantly increased net income driven by growth in our revenue, improvements in our margins. On the CapEx side of things, we finished 2022 on the low end of our range of 5% to 6%. We were at 5%. When I look at '23, we will be at the higher end of that range, primarily driven by supply chain constraints and extended lead time in our supply chain that we talked about on prior calls. And the third element in terms of working capital, again, our business will continue to grow, so we will continue to see some headwinds in terms of working capital essentially and also the impact of growing internationally, which tends to be more bigger consumers of working capital than when we grow our business in North America. So the way all of that is going to land is a little north of 20% growth in terms of free cash flow over our 2022 performance.
Operator: Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: So Jeff, in North America, I want to start there. In North America, your customer base and the majority of the customers really have three options, you can grow, you can shrink, you can go international. Where do you see, in your conversations with the bigger shale operators -- and you mentioned earlier, you think there could be a surprise to the upside in North America. How do you think they're thinking about the North American market, especially given what's going to be inventory constraints at some point here, whether it's three years, five years, seven years, we don't really know but at some point on wells and what they plan to do over the next couple of years?
Jeff Miller: Well, I expect that within sort of expectations -- within sort of capital discipline levels, I expect growth is really the only path for most of these companies. And commodity price very supportive, the international growth, very, very difficult, and shrink, not really an option. So I think that we'll see increased -- initially increased service intensity, that's the first step and that clearly we benefit from increasing service intensity. The second, if we want to go out 10 years, that's a bet against technology and that's not a bet I'm willing to make. I mean, in fact, I'm very confident in what technology will do. There is a lot of oil in North America and we're already seeing the impact of work harder producing more barrels. And then also that's one of the reasons as Halliburton the SmartFleet, as an example, I talk about it a lot, but that's one of the tools that operators can take. I expect over time and start to solve how to make more barrels and more productivity. And so as we invest a lot of R&D dollars into North America, we're kind of unique in that fashion and we try to put those dollars into what we think are most impactful. So it's not a bigger X or a smaller Y but more a function of what is the technology that I think and the company thinks will really unlock productivity over time. And I think those kind of tools in the hands of our operators, I mean, they are incredibly competitive, smart, technically deep. And I think it's more a matter of getting tools in their hands to allow them to unlock what 10 years down the road looks like.
James West: Okay, that's great perspective there. And then if I could just switch to the international side of the business. At this point, are we in a market that is still price driven or have we switched now to a market where it's about availability and service quality?
Jeff Miller: Well, I don't think you have one without the other, James, but I would expect -- my view is service quality and having equipment, quality equipment, is more and more important every day, that ultimately drives prices well. We spend a lot of time focused on how we execute and deliver service quality and our service quality feel very good. And so we are a beneficiary of that. As the market gets tighter, they start to get to the -- the market starts to pull equipment out, but I expect that sort of where we are, we've got a very good equipment portfolio and technology that we're bringing to the market and all of that certainly benefits us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Thanks, Jeff, for the framework around capital returns, and that's kind of where I want to focus my questions here today. Can you talk about why you thought at least 50% of free cash flow was the right number? And then talk about how you -- the definition of that calculation. I think it will be cash flow from -- cash flow from operations inclusive of working capital minus CapEx before M&A, but just to make sure we're on the same page.
Jeff Miller: Go ahead, Eric.
Eric Carre: I think your view is correct, yes. And the 50%, I mean, there's nothing magic in the 50% per se. We think that it's a number that gives some level of certainty in terms of what we're going to return to shareholders while giving us a lot of optionality to continue to invest in our business, to continue to make bolt-on acquisition or to make acquisitions that are complementary to our product line business. And also give us optionality over the next few years to continue to work on strengthening our balance sheet.
Neil Mehta: And that was my follow-up around capital returns. So as you think about the buyback, how do you think about approaching it? Do you want to take a more ratable approach or do you want to be countercyclical in the way that you prosecute it? And when you talk about M&A, are we talking about bolt-on type of transactions that are -- or do you see a scenario where we could be looking at larger scale things?
Eric Carre: So let me start with M&A maybe. So our philosophy there is extremely focused on adding technology. So it's a bit of a build versus buy approach to complementing our technology budget. It is a bit opportunistic at time depending on what's available and the opportunities that we have. Over the years, we've also invested in complements like smaller businesses that we can easily add to existing product lines. So that's kind of the general view that we have on technology. From an overall strategy standpoint, and I'll let Jeff jump in. But we are where we need to be in terms of the businesses we want to compete in at this stage. So going to the other part of your question, Neil, around buybacks. So I'm not going to go into a lot of details, but generally speaking, we look at buybacks as being level loaded through 2023, which will obviously top off in terms -- in order to make sure that we meet our overall target of 50% or more. So we're thinking about buybacks really as a mechanism to return cash to shareholders. We're not really trying to trade in our shares.
Jeff Miller: Let me just add to that as well. I mean I think the -- no surprises from us, our outlook on M&A hasn't changed, and it will stay that way. As we look at the capital allocation, we also want to continue, as Eric mentioned, opportunistically take out debt. We don't want to be sloppy about it, but kind of in the current market that we see, we have the opportunities to do things that are -- that make returns for the company, but we want to be crystal clear around what our minimum return was. It's clearly -- we'll work through that. But I would expect that by setting that minimum, I think it gives clarity to the marketplace that we will only do things that we believe add meaningful returns to the company.
Operator: And our next question comes from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.
Luke Lemoine: Jeff, your 4Q EBITDA margins firmly hopped in that kind of low 20% range here, basically at 14 levels, which was the target for '23, totally get there are some year-end sales there that skewed us higher in 4Q, but you're on the cusp of hitting 14 margins on an annual basis in '23. You and Lance kind of gave us a two year outlook almost two years ago. And I just wanted to see if maybe you could refresh this or expand upon it and how you see margins evolving over the next couple of years?
Jeff Miller: When we did that a couple of years ago, when we looked at published estimates, clearly, we thought they were too low. And so we've made some clear commentary and an effort to correct that. Now as we look at the published REIT estimates today, they seem about right. And so I don't want to try to continue to do that over and over. And what I am is super excited about our outlook. Margins from here are up, revenue is up. I'm as confident in our outlook and our business as I have ever been. But I just want to be clear, in Q2 of '21, we wanted to be clear that we were pointing out what we felt was missing in the future Street estimates. And today, as I said, I think published Street estimates today are about right for the years ahead, both top line and profitability.
Operator: Next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.
Chase Mulvehill: Jeff, I guess a quick follow-up or a question, maybe we can kind of dig in a little more on the international side. We spoke a little bit about this at dinner, but we get a lot of questions around confidence in multiyear growth on the international side. Obviously, we saw a strong growth last year and expectations are for another year of strong growth. I guess, could you speak to what you see for continued growth on the international side, once you get past '23 and kind of what gives you confidence that we will continue to see growth on the international side post this year?
Jeff Miller: Well, I would just start with the underinvestment that we've seen for the last roughly eight years and really haven't caught up with that. And so if I just look broadly at kind of reserve replacement and availability, that portends a lot of years of recovery and we're in the early stages of that in a lot of ways. It takes time to get international projects up underway, a lot has to be renegotiated with different partners. And so I think that what we see building is the tender backlog and these are tender backlogs that go beyond a year, well beyond a year and that's consistent with sort of the slower recovery in spend that we typically see internationally. But I'm confident that that's basically what's required to recover and produce enough oil to meet demand. Beyond that, specifically dialog with customers, target set by countries, outlooks that nearly all international countries that produce oil have targets that are certainly above where they are today, less clarity about how they get there, which actually really does indicate more service intensity in terms of how they get there, which is more activity certainly for us.
Chase Mulvehill: If I can pivot a little bit and follow up on some of the North America questions. Obviously, here, you've stated you talked about there's probably upside to North America that you don't see pricing pressure unfolding in pressure pumping, supply chain constraints, probably upside to demand. But we do get a lot of questions around pressure pumping and the risk of pricing. And really, those questions revolve around kind of lower tier fleets and kind of investors kind of asking about who has the high end fleet to the lower end fleet. So I don't know if you could take a moment and just talk about how many -- what percentage of your fleets are kind of Tier 2 diesel where if you were to see some pricing pressure, that's maybe where you would see it if you would see any?
Jeff Miller: Look, I don't see that in our business today at any level of equipment. In fact, all equipment is called for. Clearly, we have a strong environmentally -- a low emissions fleet as well that's probably at the higher end of price deck. But even at the bottom end of the price deck, our equipment -- we've systematically replaced equipment over time. And so we're really pleased with the fleet that we have and even a Tier 2 dual fuel equipment is in demand, most certainly. But what I'm most impressed with actually is sort of the strong market pull that we see around our e-fleets. We've got strong customer demand and especially I'm seeing repeat customers, which is terrific, where it's not one but two to the same customer are all fully contracted. And I think that's just an indication of the strength of our technology, it's proven, proven technology. I believe it's a better mousetrap. And quite frankly, we have a very strong IP portfolio and I think that is going to continue to be important.
Operator: Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger Read: Congratulations and well done on the quarter. I'd like to come back to some of your guidance and expectations for the international market. As we look at '23, you said kind of 15% but bias to the upside of that. I was just curious what what finished the year strong in '22, maybe better than expectations and sort of feeds into that expectation of, let's say, at least mid-teens to higher as we think about international in '23.
Jeff Miller: Look, I think it's sort of like everything is pointing at busier '23 than '22. That comes in the form of tender pipeline, that comes in form of sort of backlog increasing, product backlog that we've seen strengthened throughout the year and all of that sort of point -- I mean all of it points to '23, maybe even into '24. Discussions with customers, sort of the intensity of customers, view of staying busy and producing more barrels sooner rather than later. It's a very favorable market. And so it just gives me a lot of confidence in the outlook for '23 and particularly from our standpoint where we sit with technology and our global footprint.
Roger Read: And then on the supply chain side, not just yours, but the one you see for the industry. Any areas you think continue to have, let's just call it, headwinds broadly as we look at '23, something that would slow project development or acceleration in '23?
Jeff Miller: Yes, I don't see anything that slows things down. Are there things that have extended lead times today, we're still working through some of that. But I don't think anything meaningful gets in the way of getting started. I think we still see inflation in the marketplace. So that's one of the ways that we saw for getting things. But I don't think that it's going to be a headwind necessarily. We're starting to see rigs come back. There will be a lot of work around getting those ready in some places. But clearly, motivated customers and there will be some -- as I said, some inflation to get all of that done, but I don't see those as headwinds.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citi.
Scott Gruber: Jeff, you mentioned a very full completion calendar here in the US. A quick question on that topic. Does that pertain to the fleets that the new e-frac fleet will be coming in to replace. My question relates to, is there work already lined up that would keep the legacy fleet fully deployed or those fleets need to be bid on to new jobs?
Jeff Miller: Look, no, we've got everything as spoken for in '23, whether replacement or not, I think over time, e-fleets, replace fleets, but they don't do it initially. And so there'll be some period of time where fleets take the place of legacy fleets, but that's not what we see in ‘23, we see everything busy in '23.
Scott Gruber: Got you, that's encouraging. And then turning to D&E margins, it's another nice year of expansion there. And obviously, you guys have had internal initiatives that structurally lift those margins, but you also have a number of tailwinds today from pricing to mix. How should we think about any incrementals this year you’re willing to provide some color there? And overall, how should we think about where you could take D&E margins over the medium to longer term. I was looking back at our model and your D&E margins basically match where they were last cycle. So think about whether you guys can get to the 20% plus margin that you witnessed back in the late 2000s if this up cycle sustains?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think that I've always said, we've invested in technology and D&E in a meaningful way. We expect those margins to continue to move up. As you just mentioned, they have consistently moved up and that's on the back of technology and footprint and where we are, and I expect that trajectory to continue beyond where we are today or where we were last cycle. And so the outlook would be to continue to stack year-on-year quarters that are better than the last year. And so I have a lot of confidence in our outlook for D&E where they could go '23 and beyond.
Operator: And our next question, one moment, is from Stephen Gengaro from Stifel.
Stephen Gengaro: So I think two things for me, if you don't mind. Can you talk a little bit on the domestic pressure pumping side. Obviously, I know you guys are pretty much sold out for the year. What are you seeing in the market as far as new build supply demand fundamentals as we look three, four, five quarters out, because I know you guys are -- you got your finger on the pulse there, I'm just curious what your take is on the overall market growth or lack thereof in supply?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think the market is certainly undersupplied today. And I think that attrition is happening every day even if it doesn't happen necessarily at the fleet level, but it does happen at the unit level. And part of the way that got solved in 2022 was through industry consolidation. So that's one method of dealing with attrition is bringing in more inventory and equipment. And then the other, as I look out throughout the year, all of '23, I mean, half the capacity additions that we've heard about are electric. And I think what's being realized in the field is electric is harder to do than it looks. And from our perspective, we have proven technology, we have technology with a track record, and we have a very strong IP portfolio around frac. And so I think that combination gives me a lot of confidence, a, in where we are and also that the market won't be oversupplied.
Stephen Gengaro: And just as a follow-up, we've seen consolidation in the US pressure pumping space. And some of the larger competitors are doing things to kind of make themselves have a higher revenue content at the well site, right, different types of vertical integration or well site integration. Have you seen any change in the competitive landscape at the well site? I mean, obviously, now everybody is busy. But just in general, has there been any change in the way your competitors are competing with Halliburton?
Jeff Miller: No, I don't see any change there. when I think about sand -- you're talking about sand, and when I think about sand, we've got very good suppliers in the sand business. We work well with them. And then I think about competitive advantage, I mean, real competitive advantage. What are things that we do to create competitive advantage. And we want to spend our dollars on things where we do have clear competitive advantage, which is in this case, pumping technology and then drilling technology, software, things where we clearly have competitive advantage. I view sand clearly as an input, it's an important input, we need access to it but at the same time, don't want to overinvest in that part of the business.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to management for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Catherine. As we close out today's call, let me just close out with this. In this strong market for oilfield services, I am confident that Halliburton will execute on its strategic priorities and deliver financial outperformance. I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. You can close out the call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-25 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Halliburton’s Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Coleman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
David Coleman: Hello. And thank you for joining the Halliburton third quarter 2022 conference call. We will make the recording of today’s webcast available on Halliburton’s website after this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Eric Carre, EVP and CFO. Some of today’s comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter earnings release and in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. Now I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Our outlook today is strong, oil and gas supply remains tight for the foreseeable future, International market activity is accelerating and North America service capacity continues to further tighten. As a result, pricing is moving up in both markets. Halliburton’s strong third quarter results demonstrate the power of our strategy. Here are some highlights. Total company revenue increased 6% sequentially as both North America and International activity continue to expand. Operating income grew 18% compared to adjusted operating income from the second quarter with improved margin performance in both divisions. Our overall operating income margin was 16% representing 45% incremental margins over last quarter’s adjusted operating income. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 8% over last quarter, driven by completions activity and pricing in North America and International markets. C&P delivered operating margin of 19% in the third quarter. The Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 3%. Operating margin of 15% increased 140 basis points sequentially and 380 basis points above the same period last year, demonstrating the earnings power and global competitiveness of our D&E business. North America revenue grew almost 9% sequentially as both drilling and completions activity improved throughout the third quarter. Pricing gains and activity increases across both divisions drove these results. International revenue grew 3% sequentially with improved activity in the Middle East and Latin America that more than offset the revenue decline related to exiting our Russia business. Importantly, during the third quarter, we generated similar incremental margins in both international and North America markets. Finally, we generated free cash flow of $543 million and retired $600 million of debt during the quarter. I am pleased with the third quarter results. I want to express my appreciation to the men and women of Halliburton whose hard work and dedication made these results possible. Your commitment to collaboration, safety and service quality everyday make Halliburton successful. Turning to our macro outlook. Oil and gas supply remains fundamentally tight due to multiple years of underinvestment. This tightness is apparent in historically low inventory levels, production levels well below expectations and temporary actions such as the largest ever SPR release. Against tight supply, demand for oil and gas is strong and we believe it will remain so. While broader market volatility is clear, what we see in our business is strong and growing demand for equipment and services. There is no immediate solution to balance the world’s demand for secure and reliable oil and gas against its limited supply. I believe that only multiple years of increased investment in existing and new sources of production will solve the short supply. The effective solution to short supply is conventional and unconventional, deepwater and shallow water, new and existing developments, and short and long cycle barrels, all of it. I expect progress towards increased supply will be measured in years, not months as behavior of both operators and service companies have changed. Operators remain disciplined. Their commitments to investor returns require a measured approach to growth and investment. Service companies follow the same discipline, delivering on their commitments to investor returns and taking a measured approach to growth and investment. What I think is underappreciated is how this results in more sustainable growth and returns over a longer period of time. Let’s turn now to Halliburton’s performance, starting with the International markets. Our third quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy to deliver profitable International growth through improved pricing, selective contract wins and the competitiveness of our technology offerings. International revenue in the third quarter for the C&P and D&E divisions grew year-over-year from a percentage standpoint in the high teens and mid-20s, respectively, which outpaced International rig count growth and reflects our competitiveness in all markets. Our year-over-year growth and the margin expansion demonstrated by both divisions give me confidence in the earnings power of our International business. Looking forward, I see activity increasing around the world, from the smallest to the largest countries and producers. I expect the areas of strongest growth will be the Middle East, led by Saudi Arabia, but with meaningful activity increases in the UAE, Qatar, Iraq and Kuwait. Elsewhere, Brazil, Guyana and many others have also signaled a commitment to increased activity. Throughout these markets, I am pleased with the broad adoption of our new directional drilling platform such as iCruise and EarthStar. Importantly, these broad-based activity increases serve to tighten equipment availability and drive price increases in our International business. Shifting to North America, we had a fantastic quarter. Our solid performance demonstrates our strategy to maximize value in North America. We achieved this through improved pricing, partnering with high quality customers and differentiated technology. Our revenue grew 9% sequentially and is up 63% over the third quarter last year. Pricing continues to improve across all product lines and completions equipment remains extremely tight across the market. Interest in eFleets is strong and customers are pleased with the superior efficiencies, operational uptime and reduced carbon footprint of our market-leading solution. Looking into 2023, I see continued growth. The inbounds for calendar slots are stronger than I have ever seen at this point in the year. More importantly, I see increased demand for a limited set of equipment and an environment where technology and performance are increasingly valued, all perfectly set up for Halliburton to maximize value in North America. Market consolidation, competitors that answer to public investors, disciplined customers and supply chain constraints, all drive the services market that I expect to remain tight for the foreseeable future. Halliburton will continue to outperform in this market. Our best-in-class Zeus eFleets have pumped over 20,000 hours for customers. Our eFleet customers know that they have a field-proven technology, which carries the full weight of Halliburton’s expertise to build, run and optimize this next-generation equipment. Additionally, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system continues to gain traction and we expect an almost eight-fold increase in stages completed this year. SmartFleet gives customers unparalleled access to data about where and how their fractures permeate, the potential for frac hits on adjacent wells and the real-time data necessary to improve completion designs. In all markets, Halliburton’s strong financial performance demonstrates its strategy and action, profitable international growth, maximizing value in North America and improved asset velocity to deliver value for our shareholders today. These strategies equip us to outperform under any market conditions, but especially to maximize returns through this up cycle. Execution is at the heart of Halliburton’s identity. We collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. You have seen that in action in today’s results. You can hear how excited I am about Halliburton’s future all around the world. The structural demand for more oil and gas supply provides strong tailwinds for our business and Halliburton is ideally positioned to deliver improved profitability and increased returns for shareholders. Now I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our third quarter financial results. Eric?
Eric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our third quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.4 billion, a 6% increase over the second quarter, while operating income was $846 million, an increase of 18% over second quarter adjusted operating income. Globally, higher activity and pricing improvement supported these strong results. Operating margin for the company was 16% in the third quarter, 164-basis-point increase over second quarter adjusted operating margin and 393 basis points over adjusted operating margin in the third quarter of 2021. Our third quarter reported net income per diluted share was $0.60, an increase of $0.11 or 22% from second quarter adjusted net income per diluted share and more than doubled the adjusted net income per diluted share for the same period last year. Beginning with our Completion and Production division, revenue in the third quarter was $3.1 billion, an 8% increase when compared to the second quarter, while operating income was $583 million, an increase of 17% when compared to the second quarter. These results were driven by increased pressure pumping services, primarily in North America land and increased completion tool sales in Middle East Asia. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue in the third quarter was $2.2 billion, an increase of 3% when compared to the second quarter, while operating income was $325 million, an increase of 14% when compared to the second quarter. These results were driven by improved drilling-related services in Latin America and Middle East Asia, and increased project management and wireline services internationally. The exit from our Russia business negatively impacted financial results for both divisions. Moving on to geographic results, in North America, revenue in the third quarter was $2.6 billion, a 9% increase when compared to the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and drilling-related services in North America land. These increases were partially offset by decreased activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue in the third quarter was $841 million, an 11% increase sequentially, driven by increased well construction services and project management activity in Mexico. Europe Africa revenue in the third quarter was $639 million, an 11% decrease sequentially, almost all of this reduction was related to exiting our Russia business. Middle East/Asia revenue in the third quarter was $1.2 billion, a 6% increase sequentially and primarily resulting from increased completion tool sales in the Arabian Gulf and higher drilling services activity in Saudi Arabia and Southeast Asia. In the third quarter, our corporate and other expenses were $62 million, which was in line with expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be up slightly or roughly in line with second quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was $93 million, a slight decrease due to higher yields on cash balances. For the fourth quarter, we expect this expense to decrease slightly due to lower debt balances. Other net expense for the quarter was $48 million, primarily related to currency losses driven by the strength of the U.S. dollar. For the fourth quarter, we expect this expense to remain approximately flat. Our normalized effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 22%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to increase slightly. Capital expenditure for the third quarter were $251 million. We expect our full year capital expenditure to be in line with our target of 5% to 6% of revenue. Turning to cash flow, we generated $753 million of cash from operations and $543 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. We expect full year free cash flow to be in the range of last year’s free cash flow. With the latest payment of $600 million, we have now retired $2.4 billion of debt since 2020. We are quickly approaching our near-term leverage target of 2 times gross debt-to-EBITDA. Given our balance sheet position and strong outlook, we now have greater flexibility to increase the cash we will return to shareholders through dividends and/or share buybacks under our existing repurchase program. Now let me turn to the near-term outlook. In the Completion and Production division, we expect fourth quarter revenue to grow in the low-to-mid single digits and margins to improve 50 basis points to 100 basis points. In the Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect fourth quarter revenue to grow in the low-to-mid single digits and margins to improve 75 basis points to 125 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. Let me summarize our discussion today. Halliburton’s third quarter financial performance shows our strategy in action, delivering value for our shareholders. Oil and gas supply remains tight, requiring multiple years of investment. Demand for Halliburton services is strong. We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities that drive free cash flow and returns for our shareholders. And now, let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Dave Anderson: Hi. Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Dave.
Dave Anderson: So first question on U.S. land, so we often hear about budget exhaustion this time of year, but you actually are saying -- you are saying you are seeing stronger inbound than ever going to year end. I am curious as to how those inbounds have changed, are the inbounds more from public E&Ps versus privates? And I am also wondering, are these customers looking for term now, with such limited equipment available and does that get a premium?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Look, I mean, we are certainly not seeing budget exhaustion. We remain sold out through the end of the year and into next year. So the market is strong and activity remains strong. And so as we look at what kind of inbounds are we getting, I’d say, it’s a mix, but it may be a little stronger towards larger companies. Let’s just say it that way just given they want to be certain they have equipment for 2023. I expect that in North America, the more you work, the more you produce, the more we have to work and I think we are seeing that play out. At term, I would say that, people would like term. We view that as -- we have term, but at the same time, flexibility around pricing, just because, I really believe and I think it’s pretty clear to us that 2023 remains extremely tight, both from an equipment standpoint, repair parts standpoint, you name it, so very encouraged about the outlook for 2023 in North America.
Dave Anderson: That makes sense. I locked in term right here. Shifting over to the Middle East, you talked about increased project management in the Middle East. I don’t know if it’s a little tricky to do, I was just curious if you could just think about all those projects collectively. Where are we on the overall kind of ramp-up, are you kind of halfway there, are you kind of -- do you -- are you in closer to fully ramped up? And I guess, secondarily, once you do get ramped up on this project management, is there another leg of growth out there in terms of more tenders or is it more likely to be follow-on potentially some upselling of these contracts. It’s been a while since we have seen an upmarket in project management in Middle East?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think that really hasn’t even begun in my view. I think we are just getting underway in terms of some of the bigger projects, discrete work starting. But I think we have got a long way to run internationally and in the Middle East in particular. And this is all consistent with sort of my earlier look on the macro in terms of, we didn’t get here overnight. We got to where we are from a supply standpoint over eight years to 10 years and that’s the kind of time frame that it takes to solve for. And I think the Middle East broadly takes a long view of this business, and as a result, when they are getting traction now, but it’s not a knee-jerk reaction. It is a methodical march towards reserve extensions and adding reserves, which takes time and money, and so I am super encouraged about the outlook in the Middle East.
Dave Anderson: Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
James West: Hey. Good morning, Jeff and Eric.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, James.
Eric Carre: Good morning, James.
James West: So, Jeff, I wanted to dig in a little more on the International business, obviously, this quarter had some mixed results just given Russia coming out. But Halliburton as a company as at least I understand it and certainly you can elaborate on this, but you have spent the last the better part of the last three decades really building out a superior International franchise and one that should be competitive with your major peers or your major competitor here. Is there any reason that we should think that you would underperform or that you would outperform over the next several years in the International arena, given the outlook is as strong as kind of you are alluding to and certainly what we see in the market. We start with the Middle East, if you want, but there’s also many other regions that are going to be showing really substantial growth. I am just curious kind of how Halliburton is set up for that?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, James. Look, we are extremely well set up for International expansion and have outgrown many quarters in the past and expect to continue to do so into the future based on our technology portfolio and our footprint internationally. Just for some context, Halliburton grew 21% internationally year-on-year, while exiting Russia this quarter, and of course, this is the quarter in Russia, where we typically see the pre-winter sort of step up in the 15% range, so that wasn’t there. But we are seeing strong growth and expect to continue to see that internationally. I think also important to recall, I mentioned in my comments, was the strong international incrementals, which were basically on par with North America, which continues to demonstrate not only growth but margin expansion internationally. If I look ahead internationally, we are only halfway through our iCruise deployment.
James West: Right.
Jeff Miller: I think that all of that left to do. So I feel, like I said, really good, our production business is new and on plan and so I expect to continue growing revenue internationally and expanding margins. So I feel really good about our international outlook, actually better than I ever have.
James West: Okay. Well, that’s a very strong statement. And perhaps to follow up on that, on the D&E side, which is an International bias, you are kind of hitting margin targets that we were anticipating for next year. So you are kind of already there. And do you think and as you see the outlook and I know you may not want to get bogged down in specific numbers, but how do you see that progression as we go through the end of this year and 2023?
Jeff Miller: Look, I expect to continue to see improvement. We are in the right markets. We have got extremely competitive portfolio. All service lines are contributing to that. I think the -- when I look out, I have always said about our D&E business that we were making meaningful investments in that business, probably, started saying that four years ago and then every year…
James West: Right.
Jeff Miller: … we wanted to stack better margins on better margins, full year margin, and obviously, there’s cyclicality throughout a year in weather and other stuff. But ultimately, the plan was to continue this march on stacking on better margins and that’s what you are seeing. And as I have already said, if we are only halfway through deployment of what I think the flagship technology is in D&E, we should continue -- I expect to continue stacking those better margins up.
James West: Right. Got it. Okay. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Arun Jayaram: Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. I wanted to talk…
Jeff Miller: Hi, Arun.
Arun Jayaram: … a little bit about the portfolio, I know one of your long-term ambitions is to grow house leverage to the production phase of the oil and gas life cycle versus just pure D&C. So I was wondering, if you could comment where you think you are on -- where you are at in terms of that journey and how you think about your potential to grow your share in things like lift and chemicals?
Jeff Miller: Look, I feel good about that. I mean it’s all marching along as planned and we continue to grow. We are still in the very early innings of that International expansion, so call it, the second inning. So, but it’s doing exactly what we had hoped. We continue to grow the footprint in the Middle East with lift and with chemicals. Chemicals is -- we put our first full scale production lot through the plant this month. That’s an important first step and a lot of work to do. But again, the infrastructure is in place and we are getting access to market and making sales. The lift bottomline just a fantastic business in North America and it’s the same technology that we apply internationally and so those guys are just dead focused on profitable market entries and growth and we are seeing that Latin America and in the Middle East.
Arun Jayaram: Great. And maybe just a follow-up for Eric. Eric, you highlighted your leverage target of 2 times. A number of your peers have announced some return of capital announcements at Liberty-Halliburton [ph] campaign. I was wondering, if you could maybe give us a little bit more thoughts on how you think about return of capital after reaching your deleveraging target and how you are thinking about future dividend growth versus buybacks?
Eric Carre: Right. So, thanks, Arun. So what we have said for the last couple of years is that, our priority number one was really to get our balance sheet in order. So with the $600 million that we have retired in Q3 that puts us at about $2.4 billion retired since 2020, $1.2 billion retired this year alone. So if you combine that with our improved business performance for all practical purposes, we are at our target and considering as well our positive outlook we see no reason for that to change. So really big picture we are starting to turn our attention now to returning more cash to shareholders. So we are working through scenarios. We are engaging our Board. So, more details to come.
Arun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey. Good morning, everybody. So, I guess, first, I kind of want to hit on margins and if we kind of look at how your pre-shale margins, so call it, 2011 and maybe going all the way back to kind of 2006 and 2008 timeframe, you did mid-to-high 20% EBITDA margins. Today, you are sitting in the low 20$s. So, Jeff, I don’t -- could you just kind of walk us through what would need to happen to get back to these type of margins and whether you even think that this is possible to kind of get back to those type of margin levels in this cycle?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think, the key thing about this cycle is its duration and it’s the right kind of cycle from a duration standpoint that I think we grow into better margins as we continue forward. So I am not going to try to put a date or a time. But my expectation is the duration of the market, sort of the behavior that I described to both operators and service companies, which is absolutely rational in terms of returning cash to shareholders, which is what Eric just talked about. This is the kind of cycle where we are able to do that and I think setting up for margin improvement, the EBITDA strengthening, all of those are the things that create the free cash flow. And I think that historically, actually, I really haven’t seen the cycle set up where we have got short supply the way that we do and the sort of runway that I see in front of us and all of the right sort of motivation by the industry. I think energy is a fantastic industry and I think what you are going to see is the demonstration from the entire industry of what returning cash to shareholders and generating meaningful returns look like over a good cycle, long cycle.
Chase Mulvehill: Yeah. Perfect. Just to follow-up on International markets. Could you just talk about how tight the markets are today, what kind of pricing momentum that you are seeing and when you think about idled or spare capacity across international markets, at least for Halliburton, do you see an opportunity to continue to kind of mobilize the tighter markets or do you have a lot less spare capacity and what did that mean for CapEx for next year on the International side?
Jeff Miller: Well, from a CapEx standpoint, we have already described that we are in the 5% to 6% range of revenues on CapEx. So what we do is deploy capital to the best opportunities, which opportunity -- which international markets demonstrate important opportunity, so we would direct capital that way as opposed to others. But I think what’s important about the market as we are just seeing customer urgency return in the sense that quality matters equipment matters. Is it tight, yes, it’s tight. I don’t think there’s a lot of spare capacity anywhere in the world. If I go back to our strategic tenants, it’s profitable growth internationally and asset velocity. And I think what you see is that asset velocity being baked into just the way that we work is creating the ability to do a lot more with less than we ever have in the past. And that’s one of the key reasons we are confident in our capital spend levels is because of the type of equipment we are putting in the market, its ability to be moved around, work longer, repair faster, and when we do all of those things, it just makes us a much better effective business internationally.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. I appreciate the color. I will turn it back over. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Neil Mehta: Yeah. Good morning, team. The first question was around North America. You mentioned that you continue to see revenue growth in North America and that there is increased demand for a limited set of equipment. Can you talk about what the moving pieces are there? What kind of equipment type -- types of equipment are we talking about and how do you think about adding frac capacity, is there a demand for it as you look out in the market into 2023?
Jeff Miller: Well, the activity we really see is, let’s just describe it as service intensity, which is increasing and that’s more reps on equipment, more sand through equipment. We are also seeing our drilling activity in the U.S. as well, so all services related to D&E. But principally, frac, and so as it works harder, it grow, I mean, that generates more value for us and so that’s probably the principal thing. When I think about capacity, we are maximizing value in North America and we are growing profitably internationally, and that automatically balances where we spend our money and how we approach markets. North America from a capacity standpoint for us, really we look at eFleets and it’s not really capacity, I view it as replacement over different time horizons. But we -- the conversations, for example, that we are having about eFleets are not anything really immediate. It’s all around late 2023, 2024, 2025 in terms of eFleet additions and so that will likely wind up replacing equipment over time. Yeah, so I am really encouraged about where the market goes. It’s extremely tight, it’s tight for repair parts, it’s tight for just everything, and we have all talked about sort of bottlenecks in the supply chain. I know that’s really going to rectify itself over any sort of short horizon. So I think that under all conditions North America is tight. I think capacity…
Neil Mehta: Yeah.
Jeff Miller: … could be added in a meaningful way even if it was desired.
Neil Mehta: Yeah. That’s great perspective. And then just some early thoughts on 2023 in terms of what you are hearing from customers in terms of activity and any early thoughts around what you expect spending increases to be both in the U.S. and internationally as a percentage, and how much do you think inflation will be as a component of that increase?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think, we have got strong growth as we look into next year. Really, we don’t haven’t even seen budgets from customers, but expect that growth to be strong. Clearly, we are going to be up from here, I guess, is how I would describe next year, up from where we are today, and obviously, that’s really strong growth that we have seen over the last year. So I think that the North America demand continues to increase and internationally we have already talked quite a bit about that. But I expect that we will see growth really everywhere in the sense that customers can be busy, they will be busy. I think the traction in the Middle East is just getting underway and I think that we will continue to see a tightening. And I continue to view this as a margin cycle as opposed to necessarily, it’s not a build cycle, it’s a margin cycle and I think that we are going to be the real beneficiaries of that at Halliburton.
Neil Mehta: Thank you, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citi. Your line is now open.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Scott.
Eric Carre: Good morning.
Scott Gruber: The smaller pumpers here domestically have discussed replacing about 10% of their fleet annually, generally with e-frac additions. As we think about Halliburton, is that a rough guide for you all, assuming returns stay positive or do you have a different framework? How do you think about that kind of multiyear replacement cycle?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Look, what we are seeing, we have a healthy fleet today and we have a healthy fleet, because we have always reinvested in our fleet through thick and thin. I mean, at the worst of the market, the best of the market, we are always maintaining a replacement cycle for equipment and we get the benefit of that all of the time. When I look at the market, I have feedback from a customer recently that a lot of the equipment out there looks just dead on its feet. Don’t know how to get it replaced fast enough. I think that the pace at which we are working, what comes with the service intensity I described for frac equipment is just more revolutions and you can’t meet physics and so I think that when we look at replacement cycle, we view it as an electric replacement cycle. And so we have focused on that. We have got leading technology. And we are seeing strong pull from our customers for that technology. And so what we are doing is, as [Audio Gap] we get -- demand and pull translates into contracts of duration that return capital and cost -- and margin and capital, the actual return of capital all happen inside the same contract. And that demonstrates for me, the strength of the technology and also what that pull looks like. But it’s not something we rush to do. It’s something we do as the pull is adequate to sign that equipment up and it’s going to be over a period of time.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Okay. No. Very well guys. I appreciate the color. And then turning to -- back to the International markets, you had impressive growth internationally even without Russia this quarter, as you highlighted. We had a few inbounds though this morning trying to ascertain exactly what the International growth was year-on-year excluding Russia. I apologize if you mentioned that number earlier, I may have missed it, but are you able to share with us what that…
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Yeah. It’s…
Scott Gruber: … growth was?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. It’s 21% year-on-year International growth.
Scott Gruber: Was that inclusive of the -- of Russia or excluding Russia?
Jeff Miller: That’s excluding -- well, that’s -- Russia -- while we had Russia and excluding Russia for the last quarter.
Eric Carre: With Russia in H1 and without Russia in Q3.
Scott Gruber: Right. Do you have the number outside of Russia, how quickly you guys grew year-on-year?
Jeff Miller: That I don’t know.
Eric Carre: No.
Jeff Miller: But it would have been substantially -- it would have been more.
Scott Gruber: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I could follow-up. Okay. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: All right. Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Stephen Gengaro: Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Gengaro: Two things for me. One just from a North American perspective, how are the conversations with customers about price? I mean, obviously, pricing has been improving for a while now, is there a pushback yet? How do the conversations go as far as 2023 pricing for frac and how do you think that plays out as you go forward?
Jeff Miller: Look, I am absolutely not going to get into details around price discussions with customers. Look, I think that, I have already said, I view that pricing strengthens. We are still below pre-pandemic levels in terms of pricing, so there’s room to improve there. Service quality and technology are both driving premiums. I have talked about sort of pull on eFleets and just general performance and maintenance of the fleet. Pricing is always going to be iterative. It’s not giant steps. It’s what I talked about like throughout the year that gets us to where we are today and I think there’s a lot of power in having a structurally advantaged low emissions fleet, which is what we have out there today.
Stephen Gengaro: Is it…
Jeff Miller: Yeah, I think, one of the things that was left out of the conversation is securing capacity for 2023, reliable capacity, obviously, Halliburton we -- we are the execution company, we do what we say and so we are very reliable in terms of delivery. And I think securing that kind of capacity for 2023 is a high priority for our customers.
Stephen Gengaro: And just as a follow-up, do you see -- is there a gap and how much in conversations the sort of cost of diesel relative to the lower cost of running eFleets play into either the gap in price or the conversations about pricing?
Jeff Miller: Again, ignoring price, the conversation around the eFleets is really that it’s a better mousetrap over the long run. Is it more efficient to operate? Yes, it is. It should -- it creates value from a price standpoint, but it also creates value from an effectiveness standpoint, the ability to pump. These fleets are extremely reliable and then we took one out of the box and it pumped 500 hours first month. I mean that’s the type of reliability we are seeing out of the equipment. So I think all of that conspires to make it sought after in the marketplace. That’s why we see the pulls. Is cost a component? It probably is. I am sure it is for our clients, it always is. But I think it would be wrong to ignore the other components of value there.
Stephen Gengaro: Great. Okay. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Roger Read: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. I guess I’d like to ask the question a little bit differently on the capacity versus investment and tightness of new equipment, spare parts and everything, as you said, Jeff. But if we were to look at, maybe work you have turned down in North America or contracts that you either don’t want to bid on internationally or bid maybe less aggressively, has there been any change in that as we look across the course of 2022 and maybe what you are seeing for the early parts of 2023?
Jeff Miller: It would be returning more not less in terms of, that’s part of how we improve margins on the overall portfolio and returns. But we have been really consistent about our strategy and maximizing value in North America growing profitably internationally and that is one of the key levers that we have to do both of those things. And so, yes, we have done both of those.
Roger Read: Yeah. But I guess I am just wondering, I mean, you are turning down more not less, is it a material amount at this point or is it still pretty much just on the margin you see a project that’s not interesting or enticing?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think, that it’s -- clearly it’s -- I don’t know how to describe that is that at the margin. It’s probably at the margin, but it is going to grow as the market continues to get tighter. We are building, I have already described, our CapEx and so we will be adding. We have been able to grow with the CapEx levels that we have had. I’d say, meaningfully, over the last year and expect that we will continue to grow because of the way that we are building equipment. So it’s not we are turning everything down by any means. But I think it’s an important point that we are much more, I mean, the contracts that we pursue and win are accretive to what we are doing and if they are not, then they probably fall out of the list, just because we want to -- even the new capital that we would have, whether it’s drilling equipment or anything else that’s going to go towards things that are of higher value.
Roger Read: Yeah. It makes sense. So glad to hear there’s better selectivity out there. And then my other question was to follow-up. You mentioned tight for kind of everything in terms of new equipment, spare parts, et cetera. I know you are very integrated on the pressure pumping side in terms of manufacturing. But as you work with subcontracts, are you trying to do anything different in terms of helping them increase capacity or are we just -- the system is tight and there’s not really much prospect for change in terms of, I am just thinking the supply chain all the way down on the types of equipment where you want to expand or where there’s a relatively high maintenance component?
Jeff Miller: Look, it will get fixed over time, but in most of these cases, there’s not a lot that can be done to accelerate their supply chain when it’s far reaching. Clearly, we plan ahead and we have been planning ahead for over a year. We have got great visibility. But that market will just be tight for spare parts and equipment.
Roger Read: All right. Appreciate that. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is now open. Marc Bianchi with Cowen, your line is now open.
Jeff Miller: All right.
Operator: Please shut your mute button. Thank you. And I am currently showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Thank you, Shannon, and thank you all for participating in today’s call. Just let me summarize with a few key points. Halliburton’s strong third quarter performance shows our strategy is delivering value for our shareholders. Oil and gas supply, shortness constraints and shortages I see today create strong and growing demand for Halliburton’s equipment and services in support of this multiyear upcycle. At Halliburton, we will continue to execute on our strategic priorities to drive free cash flow and we will support of this multiyear. Looking forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Please close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-19 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Halliburton’s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to David Coleman, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
David Coleman: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2022 conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being webcast, and a recorded version will be available on Halliburton’s website following the conclusion of this call. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Eric Carre, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter earnings release and can also be found in the Quarterly Results and Presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. This was an excellent quarter. Our financial performance shows that our strategy is working and driving value. Let's get right to the highlights. Total company revenue increased 18% sequentially as both North America and international activity continued to improve in unison. Adjusted operating income grew 35% with strong margin performance in both divisions. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 24% driven by robust completions activity in North America and international markets. C&P delivered operating margin of 17% in the second quarter, the first time it reached this level since 2014. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 12%. Operating margin of 13% was down sequentially as expected due to the seasonal drop-off in software sales but increased 270 basis points year-on-year. This gives us confidence in the strengthening margin profile of our D&E business. North America revenue grew 26% as both drilling and completions activity marched higher throughout the second quarter. Strong net pricing gains across all product service lines supported sequential margin expansion. International revenue grew 12% sequentially with activity accelerating in all international regions, particularly Latin America and the Middle East. Finally, we recorded a historic best operational performance as measured by nonproductive time for the first six months of this year. I am pleased with the strong performance Halliburton delivered in the first half of this year, and I thank all Halliburton employees for their hard work, contribution to these outstanding results and dedication to superior service quality. Before we discuss our execution in the international and North America markets, let me address recent market volatility. In the second quarter, central banks took actions and an attempt to control inflation, raising concerns about a potential economic slowdown. Despite this near-term volatility, I believe the oil and gas market fundamentals still strongly support a multiyear energy upcycle. From a demand perspective, oil and gas remains a critical component of long-term economic growth. Post pandemic economic expansion, energy security requirements and population growth will continue to drive demand. Today, oil and gas supply is tight, despite an environment muted by ongoing China lockdowns and jet fuel demand below historical norms. Meaningful supply solutions will take time, OPEC spare capacity is at historical lows, the strategic petroleum reserve release is unsustainable, and the risk to Russia supply remains high. On the industry side, despite high commodity prices, operators remain disciplined because of investor return requirements, public ESG commitments and regulatory pressure. In response, service companies invested for returns and did not overbuild. In short, this cycle has been nothing like prior cycles. This means, any economic slowdown will not solve the structural oil undersupply problem. At Halliburton, the steps we took to improve operating leverage, lower capital intensity and strengthen our balance sheet best equip us to outperform under any market conditions. Here's why we believe that. First, we used the pandemic to redesign the cost profile of our business. We structurally removed over $1 billion of costs, the most aggressive cost reductions in our history. This gives us strong and sustainable operating leverage that we see today in meaningful year-on-year margin expansion in both divisions. Second, we fundamentally lowered the capital intensity of our business and set our CapEx target at 5% to 6% of revenue compared to 10% to 11% in the prior upcycle. We advanced our technology so that new generations of equipment would have higher capital velocity. This lower capital profile is key to our strong free cash flow generation. Finally, we prioritize strengthening our balance sheet and retired $1.8 billion of debt since the beginning of 2020. This reduced our cash interest expense and put us within striking distance of our leverage targets. Now, let's turn to our second quarter performance and expectations for the rest of 2022. With energy security firmly in focus, the diversification of supply sources is the central theme in the international markets. Never has energy security been a bigger issue to governments and people all over the world. However, political agendas and years of underinvestment in many markets make it harder to address this critical requirement. As I look across the international markets, our customer spend remains on track to increase by mid-teens this year, with the Middle East and Latin America expected to grow the most on a full year basis. New project announcements across the world, including in the Eastern Mediterranean, Australia and West Africa, give us confidence in continued activity acceleration in 2023 and beyond. Longer term, we believe the international markets will experience multiple years of growth. Halliburton's international business is better prepared to benefit from the upcycle than ever before. We have a strong portfolio of well construction and completion product service lines. We greatly increased our drilling competitiveness. We are present in all the markets that matter and we have unique growth opportunities in the production space. Let me elaborate. The activity mix in this upcycle is different from prior cycles. Today, operators focus more on developing known resources and less on long-term exploration programs. This means drilling more wellbores. The products and services customers require for drilling more wellbores benefit Halliburton. For example, in one of the largest international offshore markets, over 60% of a typical well service cost goes to drilling fluids, cementing and completion hardware. This means more operators spend on services where Halliburton has a leading position. Baroid, our drilling and completion fluids business entered this cycle as the leading fluids provider globally. During the downturn, we brought the chemical supply chain closer to our international customers and localized our workforce. This improved our cost competitiveness and the margins. We introduced new advanced chemistries and now run fluid systems that make better wellbores and create value for our customers and Halliburton through higher margins and lower inventory requirements. Halliburton was founded as a cementing company over 100 years ago. And since then, we never stopped leading and innovating in cementing. Every well in the world, be it a mature producer in the Middle East or a deepwater wellbore in Brazil, must be cemented. The secret to our enduring success in cementing is our capacity and drive to innovate and develop new methods to design, deliver and validate sustainable well barriers. Our latest innovation is the Cognitive Automated Cementing Platform, which allows us to deliver cement jobs autonomously. With limited human direction and intervention, a standard offshore cementing operation typically requires over 300 commands. The Cognitive platform consolidates and automates this to only five mouse clicks by an onshore operator. We already completed over 70 cementing jobs using the system in the North Sea, delivering safer operations, improved service quality and cost efficiency. Well completion tools constitute a larger portion of well services spend internationally than in North America, and they are high tech and high value-add products and services. Halliburton is a global leader in completions technology, especially in advanced completions that include sand control solutions, multilateral wells and intelligent completions. With over 20 years of multilateral installation experience globally, Halliburton is the market leader in multilaterals, a key technical component in many development wells. They help operators increase reservoir drainage in mature fields, address limited subsea infrastructure and reduce environmental impact. Over the past few years, we've strengthened our completion tools product service line in Singapore, which is closer to our international customer base and supply chain sources. With our world-class manufacturing facilities, strong local technical support and continuous innovation, Halliburton completion tools position us to outperform in the international upcycle. Another key well construction service is directional drilling. Over the last five years, we made a concerted effort to improve our drilling technology competitiveness. Our strong D&E margin performance this year demonstrates that our investment is paying off and we expect it to continue as international drilling activity ramps up. Our iCruise intelligent drilling system delivers excellent results. It now constitutes about half of our rotary steerable fleet and has been a key contributor to year-over-year margin improvements, which reflects its higher asset velocity compared to prior generation tools. Last month, for a Middle East customer, Halliburton achieved a new world record, the longest well ever drilled at 50,000 feet measured depth. This extended reach well redefine what's possible with advanced drilling technology. In many regions, as customers face increasing operational challenges and urgency to increase production, I expect that the adoption of integrated contracts will continue to grow. Today, about 20% of our international revenue comes from integrated projects, and this percentage is considerably higher in some markets like Norway, Mexico and Iraq. Halliburton's strong project management capabilities and a proven track record, compress the learning curve and drive cost savings and efficiencies for both us and our customers. The future is without a doubt, more collaborative. Customers across the world increasingly call on Halliburton for collaboration and that perfectly fits with our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value. Geographic presence is very important in the international markets, and today, we are present everywhere that matters, which is different from prior cycles. We expect to benefit from our established footprint, geographic presence and customer and supplier relationships as international markets grow. Finally, I want to highlight the international growth opportunity Halliburton has in artificial lift and specialty chemicals, which is new for this upcycle. This month, we completed our first year of operations on our electric submersible pump contract in Kuwait. We have already installed almost 200 ESPs, built an artificial lift service facility in country and delivered excellent performance for KOC. We also have successful installations in Oman and have ongoing ESP trials in Saudi Arabia. Upon completion of trials at the end of the year, we expect prequalification to participate in Saudi Aramco's future artificial lift tenders. Latin America is another successful market for our artificial lift business, where we operate in all significant land markets and just installed our 500th ESP in Ecuador. Our new chemical reaction plant in Saudi Arabia mixed the first batch of chemicals last month and is on track to meet its ramp-up goals. This year, we expect the plant to manufacture products for our production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman and chemicals for our drilling fluids, specialty chemicals and hydraulic fracturing product service lines. Today, Halliburton is a much stronger international competitor and we expect to benefit more from this multiyear upcycle than ever before. This aligns perfectly with our strategy to deliver profitable international growth. Turning to North America. This market remains strong, steadily growing and all of it sold out. Our strategic priority is to maximize value in North America by focusing on cash flow and returns, not market share. The second quarter saw another step-up in both US land rig activity and stages completed. With the first quarter sand supply interruptions resolved, frac activity steadily increased throughout the quarter. As we look at the second half of 2022, Halliburton remains sold out. As for the overall market, I believe it will be all but sold out for the second half of the year due to service company discipline, long lead times for new fleets and supply chain bottlenecks for consumables. We expect public companies will steadily execute on their drilling and completion programs. Private E&Ps capitalized on available rigs and equipment in the first half of the year and will likely maintain a measured level of activity growth for the rest of the year. We continue to believe that North America operator spending growth will eclipse 35% this year. Our customer conversations have already pivoted to 2023 plans well in advance of the typical time frame. These conversations make it clear that equipment capacity for 2023 is tight. Today, we see a services market in North America that is almost unrecognizable from prior cycles or even a handful of years ago. I believe that the returns focus we now see in the services market is not a temporary phenomenon. The largest more publicly traded pressure pumping companies now account for about two-thirds of the market. This means that investors force discipline on the majority of the industry today. In addition, industry consolidation, structural changes to customer behavior and the requirement to self-fund capital investments all drive capital discipline. In short, it's the result of rational economic behavior and I believe that it is here to stay. Halliburton is well prepared to compete in this new paradigm in North America. We have the largest technology budget in the North American services industry and our advanced technologies deliver what matters to operators: efficiency, insight and emissions reduction. For example, today, our customers can reduce environmental impact with our proven Zeus electric frac offering and optimize completions performance by capturing downhole insight with our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing solution. We operate in every major oil and gas basin across the United States using the same design of equipment built by in-house manufacturing to our specifications. This one design approach greatly simplifies equipment maintenance and helps minimize the supply chain challenges for spares and equipment. Finally, we have global capabilities in managing supply chain and labor complexities that we believe give us a distinct competitive advantage over domestic service providers. To conclude on North America. I expect Halliburton to uniquely maximize value in the strong, steadily growing and all but sold-out market. Globally, supply chain and labor shortages are front and center for many industries as the post-pandemic recovery stressed both raw material supply and transportation logistics. I believe Halliburton manages these shortages better than competitors. Our global business development, supply chain and technology organizations closely monitor market trends and work to mitigate cost impacts through economies of scale and global procurement, technology modifications and efficient sourcing practices. For example, as chemical costs increase, we work with our customers to adjust our pricing for cost inflation. Operators appreciate that these price adjustments are required for us to continue delivering our services. Most customers expect and accept these adjustments. Halliburton's world-class technology organization gives us the ability to change formulations for certain products to avoid the most inflationary inputs. We have already implemented these design changes for some of our drilling fluids and completion tool elastomers. Finally, we have internal chemical manufacturing capabilities in the US and Saudi Arabia, which allow us to diversify supply, mitigate risk and better control input prices. In North America, we employ our global HR capabilities for managing commuter labor to hire out of basin and avoid labor shortage pressures in local markets. This allows us to secure talent from states outside of white hot labor markets in traditional oil and gas basins. At the same time, our voluntary attrition numbers remained stable, both globally and the US. This demonstrates that once we attract the right talent, we provide them with the right incentives and growth opportunities. Turning now to pricing dynamics that we see playing out in North America and internationally. As I stated before, this is a margin cycle, not a build cycle. In North America, net pricing improvements drove our strong C&P margin expansion in the second quarter, and I expect pricing gains to continue. Here's why. Existing active equipment and experienced crews are in high demand and will continue to be highly sought after to efficiently execute programs in the second half of this year and into 2023. The market remains all, but sold out. Supply chain bottlenecks even for diesel fleets make it almost impossible to add incremental capacity this year. Halliburton has the additional advantage that our fleet primarily competes at the higher end of the pricing spectrum. Our portfolio of low emissions equipment commands premium prices and our customers see value in the efficiency and emissions profile we provide. Internationally, we see structural tightness in many product lines, particularly drilling and wireline. Increasing activity soaks up capacity market-wide. And recently, some customer request for additional equipment had to go unanswered. As equipment availability continues to tighten, we expect prices will increase further. Due to the long-term nature of international contracts, only about one-third of our work re-prices every year. This means that margin and pricing inflections internationally will always materialize at a slower pace than in North America. We see evidence of customer urgency indicated by customer preference to pursue direct negotiations for contract extensions. The efficiency gains over the last several years have all accrued directly to operators, and there is still a great deal of room in customer's economics for service providers to earn a fair and durable return. So it often goes unsaid, a robust and investable service industry is a key enabler of our customers' ability to grow and maintain production to address the world's energy needs. I'm thrilled with Halliburton's performance in the second quarter and our immediate and long-term opportunities. Our team is executing well on near-term tactical objectives and the long-term strategic priorities provide real tangible value for Halliburton and our shareholders. Halliburton's competitive position is unique among our peers. We have the scale and technology to benefit meaningfully and differentially from the international market expansion, and we are the leader in the strong, steadily growing and all but sold out North American market. I could not be more excited about the future of Halliburton. Now I will turn the call over to Eric to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Eric?
Eric Carre: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter results, compared to the first quarter of 2022. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion and adjusted operating income was $718 million, an increase of 18% and 35%, respectively. Higher equipment utilization and net pricing gains supported these strong results. In the second quarter, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $344 million as a result of our decision to exit Russia due to sanctions. Now let me take a moment to discuss our division results in more details. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2.9 billion, an increase of 24% while operating income was $499 million, an increase of 69%. These results were driven by increased pressure pumping services in the Western Hemisphere; higher completion tool sales globally, increased artificial lift activity in North America land and Kuwait, and improved cementing activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. These improvements were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in Oman and decreased artificial lift activity in Latin America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2.2 billion, a 12% increase, while operating income was $286 million, a decrease of 3%. This revenue increase was due to higher fluid services and wireline activity globally, increased project management activity in Latin America and the Middle East, and increased drilling services in Latin America. Operating income decrease was driven by seasonally lower software sales globally and decreased drilling services in Brazil. Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue grew 26%, primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and artificial lift activity in North America land, increased fluid services, wireline activity, well intervention services and higher completion tool sales across the region and increased cementing activity in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 16% due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina and Colombia, increased stimulation and well construction services in Mexico, increased drilling related services in the Caribbean, improved stimulation activity in Brazil and higher project management activity in Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased drilling related services in Brazil and lower artificial lift activity in Argentina and Ecuador. In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 6% resulting from higher activity across multiple product service lines in Angola and Eastern Mediterranean, improved cementing activity, pipeline services, wireline activity, and testing services across the region and increased through its services and completion tool sales in the UK. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the wind down of our business in Russia and decreased drilling services in Norway. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 14%, primarily resulting from higher activity across multiple product service lines in the Middle East, Australia and Brunei. These increases were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Oman. All regions experienced a seasonal decline in software sales. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense was $67 million, which was higher than expected due to the timing of employee incentives. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be slightly lower. Net interest expense for the quarter was $101 million and should remain about flat for the third quarter. Other net expense for the quarter was $42 million, primarily related to currency losses driven by the strength of the US dollar. For the third quarter, we expect this expense to remain about flat. Our normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 22%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be slightly higher. Capital expenditure for the quarter were $221 million and will steadily increase for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we expect our CapEx to remain at 5% to 6% of revenue. Turning to cash flow. We generated $376 million of cash from operation and $215 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. Working capital investments grew to support the 18% sequential revenue growth. As is typical for our business in an upcycle, we anticipate free cash flow for the year to be back-end loaded and expect to generate free cash flow at or above last year's level. Now let me turn to our near-term outlook. In the Completion and Production division, we expect third quarter revenue to grow in the mid-single digits and margins to improve 75 to 125 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect our third quarter revenue to grow in the low to middle single digits. As a result of activity improvements, we expect D&E margins to be flat to up 50 basis points. I will now turn the call back to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Eric. To summarize our discussion today, we are still in the early innings of a multiyear upcycle. The oil supply and demand fundamentals remain constructive for both international and North America markets. The steps we took to improve operating leverage, lower capital intensity and strengthen our balance sheet set Halliburton up to outperform under any market conditions. Internationally, Halliburton is a much stronger competitor, and we expect to benefit more from this multiyear upcycle than ever before. This aligns perfectly with our strategy to deliver profitable international growth. In North America, I expect Halliburton to uniquely maximize value in the strong, steadily growing and all but sold out market. We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities and remain committed to driving profitable growth, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multiyear upcycle unfolds. And now let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from James West from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
James West: Hey, good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Eric.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, James.
Eric Carre: Good morning, James.
James West: So Jeff, as you think about the cycle from here, we're clearly setting up for a pretty strong and healthy upcycle where the operating leverage is really in the early days of showing up. But how do you think about the next several quarters, maybe several years if you want to take it that far, playing out in terms of the cycle, there seems to be a growing -- at least from what I can tell, growing urgency from the customer base to bring production or accelerate activity levels from here. And so we could be in a position where you see growth that moves much higher than kind of the steady growth we've seen so far, but could be at a tipping point.
Jeff Miller: James, yes, agree in terms of the outlook. In fact, what I see is a lot of duration in this cycle. I mean, obviously, it's been moving up, and I expect it continues to move up. But the reality is if operators can be busy, particularly international, they are. And the tightness around oil supply is not something that's resolved quickly after seven, eight years of underinvestment. And so while I'm excited about the inflection and the improvement in the upcycle that we see, I have to say I'm equally excited about the duration. This is multiples of years, I was a decade in the making. It's many years in the undoing in terms of producing. And so I think this is a fantastic time for operators and an even better time for Halliburton.
James West: Right. Right. Okay. That makes sense. And then from a competitive standpoint, are you seeing the discipline that maybe we hadn't seen in prior years from your competitors, but it seems now like everybody kind of is on the same page as its returns, its margin. And so are you seeing the same kind of pricing discipline that I know you guys are exhibiting the market?
Jeff Miller: Look, pricing is improving around the world. And it's a rational -- it's the allocation of assets and it's moving them to the highest returning opportunities. And that's not unique to Halliburton in terms of expectation of return. I mean, we clearly want to improve our returns and plan to do so. But that's part of this different cycle, different market dynamics in the sense that returns and return of cash matter to our shareholders. And the best way to do that is to not just improve utilization, but improved returns on every asset. And clearly, the approach we're taking and our whole strategy internationally is built around profitable growth, which is, I think, precisely what you saw this quarter and what you'll continue to see from Halliburton in the future.
James West: All right. Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our question. And our next question coming from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Your line is open.
David Anderson: Great. Thanks. Good morning, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, David.
David Anderson: Good morning. So nice increase in the North America top line this quarter, well above the rig count, wondering if you could put this into context for us in terms of the customer base that was sort of the incremental driver here? Was it the privates or the public, I guess, is sort of the core question. Along those same lines, I was just wondering, if you could talk about your customer mix and how you're thinking about it. On the one hand, with all the equipment shortages, I would think you could push pricing further with the private. But on the other hand, of course, you get the – the more visibility, the larger E&P program. So I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about that optimal customer mix today? And does a potential for any recession come into consideration in terms of that mix.
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Let me start with the first part of that question. The activity was really in both camps. We saw a lot of activity. Obviously, a lot of the interruptions in the first quarter were out of the way. And so we had a full utilization quarter, which was certainly a positive from an activity perspective, and that applied equally to privates and publics. Really from a pricing standpoint, important that, we're iteratively moving on pricing and I would argue that's again, consistent in both groups. And from a visibility standpoint, I think it's important to note, I mean, A, we love our customer mix today. I want to be clear. And it maybe slightly weighted towards publics, but that is really – the privates we work for are big privates. And there are some privates that are bigger than public out there in the marketplace and work for them. And they have terrific visibility as well. So I mean the privates, just like the publics, fully understand, A, that OPEC spare capacity is not there or they would be meeting their quotas. They have great visibility of the supply and demand for oil in our business. And that dialogue has been about 2023 capacity for Halliburton to provide either more equipment or more services, not recession. I can promise you that it's not the discussion, the discussion and what we see in our business is activity demand moving up. We see a tighter 2023 than we see in 2022. So all of these signals and in our business are extremely positive.
David Anderson: Absolutely, I agree. And also I think also noteworthy how your margins are now back to 2014 levels. That's really impressive, I would say. A separate question, Jeff, on the Middle East, you highlighted a 14% increase in revenue this quarter a bunch of contracts are starting up. You mentioned project management that Kuwait ESP project is moving well. It sounds like there's more tenders to come. Question, are we already starting to see the ramp-up in the Middle East? Maybe you could just, kind of, give us your sense of what's going on in the ground in terms of mobilization and the pace of activity. I think you highlighted kind of service discipline over there in terms of pricing. So hopefully, that's looking pretty good. But maybe just tell us what's happening on the ground today? I know we've been waiting for this for a while.
Jeff Miller: Look, I think we're still early innings of Middle East. And so more activity, yes; activity underway, yes. But in terms of supply chain or let's just think more broadly around equipment, rigs, et cetera, those don't come back to work instantaneously. And so I -- my view is there's a lot more demand for services in the Middle East certainly than we're seeing today. So I would say as equipment can be mobilized as projects get underway, I think there's a lot more of that to come.
David Anderson: Good to hear. Thanks Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Thank you.
David Coleman: Next question please.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open.
Arun Jayaram: Good morning Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Good morning.
Arun Jayaram: Jeff, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how is contracting philosophy in North America this cycle. Is it consistent with typical cycles, but I want to get your thoughts on that. You've been essentially sold out for some time now, and we're just trying to gauge the velocity of pricing gains, which could manifest in the second half of this year versus 2023 when a lot of your customers are armed with new budgets?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Look, I'd be crazy to get into all of those details on a call. But philosophically, I mean, our -- in practical -- in practice, I mean, prices are moving iteratively. And I think that's an important component of what we're seeing when market's tight like this. We ratably look at the best opportunity for assets and what that drives this approach to pricing, which is one that we've seen until now. And so as we look out into the future, in a market like this, we maintain optionality, but we also have very good customers with deep relationships. And because of that, there's a premium on equipment that is working and efficient, particularly in a market that looks like this. And so, look, our customers understand that a vibrant service industry is a critical component of their ability to deliver what they have to deliver. And so I think that as we look out through this year and really into next year, we ought to continue to see improvement in pricing.
Arun Jayaram: Fair enough, Jeff. I wanted to talk a little bit about specialty chemicals and artificial lift. You've highlighted how this provides some unique growth opportunities for how the cycle -- I was wondering if you could maybe help us think about just at a high level, what are some revenue or growth opportunities for how -- from these two segments. Again, we're just trying to estimate what this could mean for your full cycle earnings power?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I want to -- I'm going to -- it's a meaningful opportunity. I mean I think if you go look at total available market for artificial lift, for example, we have a leading position. Actually, some it's number one in the US today and we are just beginning internationally. We've got talked about the growth we've seen, but it is a drop in the bucket compared to what that total available market is out there for lift internationally. And of course, we're super pleased with the technology at Summit, and it's just a matter of growing that business internationally, which the examples I've given you are examples of us doing that. But I would say this is the -- there is the beginnings on what's possible.
Arun Jayaram: Yes. Fair enough. Thanks a lot, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you. Next question.
Operator: One moment for our next question. And our next question coming from the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is open. One moment.
Chase Mulvehill: Yes. Good morning. Real quick, just kind of a follow-up on the 2Q guide and maybe we'll just chalk it up to conservatism. But if we think about the top line, I think if you kind of blend things together from your segment guidance, it kind of implies a 4% or 5% sequential growth in top line. But if we kind of step back and think about expectations for North America and International, I would have expected both North America and international revenues to actually outpace that 4% to 5%. So just kind of help us connect the dots and maybe Russia is a little bit of a drag in 3Q, but just kind of help us connect the dots between North America and international relative to your guidance.
Jeff Miller: Well, I think the first half outperformed. It's a strong year. So I still see us eclipsing 35%. That means more than 35%. The international outlook for us includes Russia dropping out in Q3. So the guide that we have given in the 3% to 5% and that range overcomes Russia, which is exactly what we thought would happen. We thought there would be outsized spending outside of Russia likely to compensate for that, and that's precisely what we're seeing. North America, I'd describe it as steadily growing. And I think that's what steadily growing looks pretty strong on the first half, and it continues to grow. I think that the market is very positive. We got to put a number on it, but it's certainly been strong until now, and this continued to really outperform consistently, so -- 
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. Makes sense.
Jeff Miller: This is clearly not -- this is not a step back. This is a step forward in both hemispheres, both US and international.
Chase Mulvehill: Yes, makes sense. I mean, you've got a history of beating expectations, so we'll just kind of leave it there. The follow-up here, if we think about leverage ratios, obviously, they're falling pretty quickly. Your outlook remains robust. It looks like maybe early next year, you might hit 1 times on a leverage ratio. So it puts you in a position to really kind of focus more on returning cash to shareholders really over the next, call it, 6 to 12 months. So could you talk to this a little bit and how you're thinking about buybacks versus dividends and just kind of overall frame kind of the shareholder -- the cash return to shareholder framework.
Eric Carre: Yes. Let me take that one, Chase. It's Eric here. So I'll start by saying that the most important point here is that our priorities as a company have not changed. So maybe let me summarize how we think about this. So first, to your point, we'd like to continue to pay down more debt. Then we would like to continue to return more cash to shareholders. From that perspective, our buyers right now is toward increasing the base dividends but would like at some point in time to address dilution as well. And if you look at the progress that we've made, we've made significant progress actually towards these objectives since the beginning of 2020. We've retired $1.8 billion worth of debt, $600 million this year. If you look at what's ahead of us, we have about $1 billion coming up between 2023 and 2025. Once that is retired, we basically have a clean slate until 2030, which is going to give us great flexibility. The other point I would make is that in Q1 of this year, we did both. So we did retire that and we increased dividend about triple -- pretty close to triple the dividend. So these things don't necessarily need to be done sequentially. We can do them at the same time. And finally, I would say that we fully expect to continue to grow shareholder distribution as the upcycle accelerates. Yes.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. Perfect. I’ll turn it back over. Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question coming from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Neil Mehta: Yes. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, team. First question is just the 400 basis point margin improvement target, clearly making progress towards it. Maybe just talk about your views on when you think you can get there and whether there's some upside skew given the commodity macro.
Jeff Miller: Thank you. Look, our -- my long-term outlook is unchanged except that it's biased upwards. In fact, I'm more bullish than I was before. I want to be careful and not get in the business of trying to update that every quarter. But our outlook, my outlook on sort of the trajectory of the market today, the macro in terms of supply shortage, short oil in the world. And I think really importantly, not only is the price of the commodity, always important. Energy security has moved back central -- front and center for a lot of countries and continents. And so that's going to just put further support under my outlook in terms of being busy, the type of activity I described in terms of more wellbores. That's a really important point, meaning that making more barrels is going to look like a lot more development work, a lot more tie back kind of work, and I've described sort of a lot of that spend or right in areas where Halliburton leads, whether it's drilling fluids, cementing and completion tools and then the progress we've made in other parts of our business, I think sets up very well. So without trying to update that outlook, hopefully, I'll give you enough color that we feel really good about it.
Neil Mehta: Yes. That's good color. And then the follow-up is on working capital and free cash flow, to your point. Free cash flow did come a little softer than we were expecting, but a lot of that is working capital, which is consistent with an upcycle. So just talk about the back half progression in free cash flow as you see it and anything that would need to keep them up.
Eric Carre: Yeah. Good morning, Neil. It's Eric. So the headline is expect free cash flow to follow the typical upcycle profile. So, basically, very heavily loaded towards the second half of the year. And we feel very good about the outlook of the business. The working capital built in Q2 was really to support our growth. So our revenues went up 18%, about $800 million Q2 over Q1. But what was really good is that the efficiency of our working capital improved versus the prior cycle. So – and we have to do that while managing inflation, managing longer lead time in the supply chain. So we're very pleased with how our organization has managed the situation and the overall progress we're making. So as we get into H2, I think the situation will evolve, and we fully expect to deliver on the free cash flow targets despite the working capital headwinds we had in H1.
Neil Mehta: Thank you, guys.
David Coleman: Next question.
Operator: One moment for our next question. And our next question is coming from the line of Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is open.
Stephen Gengaro: Thanks, and good morning, gentlemen. Two things for me. I think the first is, when you look at the domestic frac business, and you obviously, you talked about consolidation you guys have stuck to your plans on CapEx. Are you seeing much out there as far as the new builds in the industry? And maybe talk a little bit about lead times for new equipment at this point?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Thanks. The – A, the lead times are still quite long. I mean – and so I think probably a year to meaningfully do anything. But the market has changed. And so A, we haven't had any meaningful additions into this business at all in six years. So that's a long time. And if I think about our business, I mean, we're always replacing the aging part of our fleet. That's not adding capacity. That's just simply retiring equipment or equipment that's unable to operate or gets damaged in the process of working, which that happens, too. And so at some level, addressing attrition at the bottom end of the fleet is important. And that's one of the reasons – we do that. That's one of the reasons we have Halliburton one of the healthiest fleets in the industry. The other broad thing that's happening, I would say, is this conversion to lower emission, which again is not adding capacity, but I would see it as a conversion. But the supply chain issues I started with are very real. And I think given the consolidation in the industry, the sort of lack of capital broadly to invest, I think what you'll see – I think -- I'm just going to guess others view the fleet the way that I do. And I think that what that means is that, we won't see capacity adds.
Stephen Gengaro: Thank you. And then when we think about – you mentioned the pricing dynamics that you've seen, obviously, things are strong. Has there been any pushback from the E&P side? I mean, I know they're always not trying to take a lot higher prices, but have you seen any material pushback, or just because it's so tight, it's been fairly easy discussions.
Jeff Miller: It's always a discussion, respectfully. But I also think what underpins this is how important service industry is to delivering on what our operators need to do. And I think there's clearly a recognition of that. And so always a discussion, always some back and forth, but realistically, our operators require quality services, and that means fleets that are well-maintained, fleets that are -- attrition is dealt with. And better efficiency in our case, better technology. All of that's appreciated and realized that that has to make solid returns for it to remain vibrant. And I think that's what underpins those conversations.
Stephen Gengaro: Great. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: Thank you. Next question.
Operator: One moment for your next question. Our next question coming from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is open.
Marc Bianchi: Thank you. Jeff, you mentioned you had been speaking to some customers about 2023. What kind of increases are they talking about for North America and International?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think it's consistent with making returns, but up. So let's start with surety of supply. Internationally, it's probably more around ability to supply. I think that operators, particularly in the US, understand returns and shareholder returns, and so do we. And so I think we see a steady march up, but a healthy march up in the sense that as we described, a lot of duration to this cycle, which I think is much welcome by us and I think by our shareholders are going to benefit from that meaningfully because of the duration. So the -- you look at how we've improved the capital intensity of our business, our clients view it the same way. And I think that -- so what we're going to see is more activity, no question, because there's going to be demand for the commodity. But it's -- so it's more around could you add one or do you have an extra one and really a lot of that dialogue given lead times and commitments around our own capital. And I think broadly, the industry's commitment around capital as it comes down to what's the highest returning opportunity for that equipment is more of what that discussion goes like.
Marc Bianchi: Okay. Thanks. And on D&E, do you think you can get back to first quarter margins this year?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean the D&E -- the short answer, yes. Longer answer is that I'm really pleased with the progression and the progress we've seen with D&E margins. If we -- I've always said take a long view of D&E margins and I expect them every year to be higher than last year and next year to be higher than this year. There is some seasonality in that D&E business, both where we work in the world and some of the components that comprise D&E. But the target, and clearly, the expectation by me is that we are just layering on that seasonality a step up every single year, and that's what we've seen.
Marc Bianchi: Great. Thanks so much.
Jeff Miller: Thank you. Next question.
Operator: Thank you. I’m sorry, that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jeff Miller for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Okay. Thank you, Olivia. Before we close out the call, let me just reiterate, Halliburton's performance during the strong quarter demonstrates that we're executing on the right strategy in the international and North America markets to drive value for shareholders throughout this multiyear upcycle. I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Please close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-19 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Halliburton's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to David Coleman, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with Halliburton's first quarter results. Our performance demonstrates the resilience of our unique strategy in action and the importance of our competitive positioning, both in North America and international markets. Here are some highlights from the first quarter. International revenue grew 15% compared to the first quarter of 2021, with activity accelerating across all international markets. Strong growth in Latin America and the Middle East/Asia offset the winter weather impacts in Europe. In North America, revenue grew 37% year-on-year with the acceleration of both drilling and completions activity. Higher utilization in March and net pricing gains drove margin expansion despite weather and sand disruptions earlier in the quarter. Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 26% compared to the first quarter of 2021 on activity increases in North America, Africa and the Middle East, while operating income increased 17% despite transitory U.S. land/sand delivery disruptions. Our Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 22% year-on-year, while margins expanded 440 basis points and started the year at 15% for the first time since 2010. This exceptional performance was largely driven by the strength of our directional drilling and project management businesses. We added three new companies to Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. This brings the total number of program participants and alumni to 15 companies. Halliburton Labs allows us to actively participate in the future of clean energy value chain. Finally, we retired $600 million of our $1 billion of debt maturing in 2025 and nearly tripled our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share. These actions strengthen our balance sheet and reflect our commitment to return cash to shareholders. Before we continue, I want to provide a few comments about the current situation in Ukraine and Russia. This is a tragedy on many dimensions and for us, especially for our people in both countries. As we've all seen, governments in the European Union, the United States, Switzerland and other countries swiftly enacted far-reaching sanctions on new investment and export controls on goods, supplies and technologies to Russia. In compliance with sanctions and consistent with our strategy for profitable international growth, we announced that we would begin steps toward a wind-down of our Russian operations, and we remain active in that process. Russia accounts for about 2% of our business. Sanctions and export compliance impact everyone in the oilfield and operations and supply chains in Russia are, at best, challenged. The situation is far too early and evolving to say more. Moving on to our macro outlook, we expect oil and gas demand will grow over the near and medium-term, driven by economic expansion, energy security concerns and population growth. At the same time, supply remains under structural threat of scarcity. While the war in Ukraine has created a short-term dislocation in commodity markets, the fundamental supply tightness existed before this geopolitical conflict. Current oil supply tightness and commodity price levels strengthen my confidence in the accelerating multiyear upcycle and very busy years ahead for Halliburton. In addition, I expect an important change in our customers behavior and priorities will provide structural support to oil prices throughout this upcycle. I believe supply dynamics have fundamentally changed due to investor return requirements, public ESG commitments and regulatory pressure, which make it more difficult for operators to commit to long-cycle hydrocarbon investments and instead drive investment flexibility through short-cycle barrels. The pursuit of increased investment flexibility leads operators to prioritize short-cycle projects, development over exploration, tiebacks versus new infrastructure and shale rather than deepwater. Clearly, there are important exceptions where successful long-term projects will be developed, but painting with a broad brush I believe most investments will be directed primarily towards short-cycle activity in the near and medium-term. The result of this focus is an industry-wide increase in the level of investment flexibility for operators and the subsequent support to commodity prices. With short-cycle barrels, companies make investment decisions annually and can respond more quickly to commodity price signals. As a result, when investment stops, production at a minimum doesn't grow. And in the case with unconventionals, it quickly declines. For example, when the pandemic drove the collapse of oil demand two years ago, U.S. shale companies swiftly reduced activity and production declined 2 million barrels in nine months. In contrast, long-cycle projects have two key elements: a long-time horizon and large upfront capital investment. Once these projects begin, investment continues and production cannot quickly respond to price signals. This tends to result in market oversupply. The pivot to short-cycle barrels creates the opposite effect, a perpetual threat of undersupply that is supportive to commodity price. I believe this pivot to short-cycle barrels is great for Halliburton and sets up fantastic conditions for us to outperform. Short-cycle activity results in higher relative capital spend by operators aimed directly at the wellbore for services Halliburton provides as opposed to infrastructure investments required for long-cycle projects. Our strong technology portfolio and market footprint match this activity globally. Halliburton works, innovates, and invests where it matters most for our customers. And finally, Halliburton's value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers explicitly focuses on helping operators maximize returns and cash flow. This makes Halliburton uniquely relevant for this environment. Our five strategic priorities are clear and effective and will drive our behavior in this upcycle. First, we focus on profitable growth in our strong international franchise. Second, we maximize value and cash flow in North America. Third, we accelerate the deployment and integration of automation and digital technologies. Fourth, we drive increased capital efficiency in all parts of our business. And fifth, we actively participate in advancing a sustainable energy future. As demand for Halliburton services increases, both internationally and in North America, we will execute on our five strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. As I look across the international markets, I continue to believe our customers' international spend will increase by mid-teens this year. Here are some leading indicators. First, we started with revenues in the first quarter much higher compared to the same period of last year. Second, our completion tool order book increased 50% year-on-year in the first quarter, which represents work generally delivered within the current year. And third, we have a strong pipeline of new projects scheduled to start in the second half of this year, particularly in the Middle East. We expect international activity to gain momentum in the second quarter, led by the Middle East and Latin America and further accelerate in the second half of the year. More importantly, our strong first quarter Drilling and Evaluation division margins demonstrate our focus on profitable international growth. Beyond the shift to short-cycle barrels already discussed, we expect this international up cycle to be structurally different from prior cycles and Halliburton's international business is poised to benefit from it. Here's why. National oil companies and independents comprise a larger portion of the international customer set. As a result of divestitures in the last few years, many international assets now have new owners who require a more collaborative service provider to help unlock remaining reserves and maximize value. Halliburton's collaborative approach, broad technology portfolio, local expertise, and reliable execution help customers achieve their efficiency and production objectives. Halliburton's execution of our technology roadmap has completely transformed our competitiveness in Drilling and Evaluation. We enter this upcycle with the best product portfolio in our history and we see increased customer demand for our high-end technology and a recognition of its value. For example, Halliburton recently deployed our new Strata Examiner Wireline Imaging Service for multiple customers in Norway and Morocco. Strata Examiner helped operators acquire more accurate well data in oil and synthetic-based muds, better evaluate production potential and save rig time with log-down capability and increased logging speed. Another example is the latest addition to our logging while drilling suite, the StrataStar Azimuthal Resistivity Service for thin interbedded formations. Similar to our premium EarthStar service, the StrataStar combines high fidelity downhole sensors with powerful digital inversion capabilities. Multiple customers in the Middle East, Latin America, US and Canada use it for faster, more accurate reservoir characterization to precisely place wells in the most productive zones and maximize asset value. We also see a slight uptick in offshore exploration activity albeit from a historically low base. Halliburton's increased competitiveness in drilling and evaluation resulted in a doubling of our contract win rate in global exploration work over the last two years and we expect to benefit from any additional growth in this higher-margin market. Different from prior cycles, Halliburton's investments in specialty chemicals and artificial lift create unique growth opportunities as we expand the international footprint of these businesses. Last month, I attended the opening of our new chemical reaction plant in Saudi Arabia. Multiple years in the making, this world-class facility establishes our chemicals manufacturing footprint in the Eastern Hemisphere. It is our launch path for profitable growth in the specialty chemicals industry in the Middle East and beyond. This quarter, it will start manufacturing products for our production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman and chemicals for our own product service lines. Several years ago, I described digitalization as one of the defining trends in our industry for this decade. Today, digital innovations permeate all segments of the oilfield services market. At Halliburton, our strategy to drive digital and automation creates technological differentiation, contributes to higher international margins and drives internal efficiencies and cost savings. Here are some examples. On an integrated drilling project in Southeast Asia, Halliburton deployed Well Construction 4.0, our approach to digital transformation of well construction. It improved the rate of penetration by about 40% on initial wells and reduced rig site personnel by 21%. On an integrated project in the Middle East, we combine data science, smart bits drilling automation and project management services for a more than 40% reduction in average well delivery time. We also deploy our digital solutions to advance a sustainable energy future. In the first quarter, Energean hired Halliburton to assess the carbon storage potential of the Prinos Basin in Greece, who will use our DecisionSpace 365 cloud applications to perform long-term ploom modeling, characterize the storage complex and create a conceptual development plan with performance modeling. We expect to deliver steady, profitable growth in the international markets for the rest of this year. Increased activity and equipment tightness continued to sharpen our pricing discussions with customers. Pricing is increasing on current contract extensions. In the first quarter, the percentage of contract extensions exercised almost doubled compared to the same period last year, as operators generally prefer to extend existing contracts rather than bid work in an inflationary market. Pricing is also increasing on new work. Turning to North America. We see market tightness across all service segments. In the first quarter, average US rig count increased 14% sequentially and is up 62% year-on-year. Additionally, frac activity surged in March after winter weather and supply chain disruptions occurred earlier in the quarter. Halliburton's hydraulic fracturing fleet remains sold out and the overall market appears all, but sold out for the second half of the year. The market today presents several positive elements, previously absent in North America, and they give me confidence in the continued strength of this market over the coming years.  First, in the largest service segment in North America, the hydraulic fracturing market structure has improved. Today, the largest four pressure pumping companies account for about two-thirds of the market. Second, I believe that poor service industry returns over many years in North America, ultimately resulted in a closed-loop capital system because access to meaningful outside capital, doesn't exist today, market participants must generate their own cash in order to reinvest and grow their businesses. Broad-based profitability improvements are required to fund growth, not just what appears to be good economics on a single incremental fleet.  Finally, I see greater differentiation in hydraulic fracturing equipment types. In prior cycles, fleets were relatively the same. Today, all equipment is not created equal. Significant operational, environmental and pricing differences exist ranging from electric fleets at the top; dual fuel and Tier 4 diesel in the middle; and finally, Tier 2 diesel equipment at the bottom. We have a terrific fleet composition. Halliburton is the leader in low emissions frac equipment.  Our Zeus eFleets have committed contracts, earn attractive returns and deliver improved performance. Another technology that sets Halliburton apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market is our SmartFleet Intelligent Fracturing System. Customers are adopting this groundbreaking technology and it has moved from pilot to campaign mode. We are deploying it for multiple operators across different basins and expect a six-fold increase in the number of stages completed with SmartFleet this year.  Tightness in North America is not just in hydraulic fracturing equipment. It exists across the whole oil and gas value chain, in spare parts, engines, electronics and many other inputs that cost more and are sometimes, not immediately available. While, we generally pass these increased costs on to operators, we also have effective solutions that minimize this operational impact and provide reliable execution for our customers.  For example, our sophisticated supply chain organization responded by sourcing sand from Wisconsin when local mines were down in the Permian. In trucking, our collaboration with Vorto provides us with real-time information on the market clearing price for drivers and allows us to manage inflation and significantly reduce logistics-related nonproductive time.  Years of low pricing and low returns impacted the North American oilfield services sector and the larger supply chain that supports our industry. Sustainably improved pricing is required to avoid future supply chain disruptions and to invest in the equipment, people and technology necessary to deliver production growth. I believe our customers understand this. Against this backdrop, we see a long runway for ongoing net pricing improvement across all of our product service lines. In this recovery, Halliburton is focused on maximizing value in North America. For us, this is a margin cycle, not a build cycle.  Last quarter, I shared with you my view that North America customer spending would grow more than 25% year-on-year. Today, as I look at a combination of customer activity and inflation, my outlook has improved, and I now expect North America spending to increase by over 35% this year. With respect to activity, over 60% of the US land rig count sits with private companies and they keep growing, while public E&Ps remain committed to their activity plans. Activity and demand for our services are increasing, both internationally and in North America. With our unique value proposition, clearly defined strategic priorities and global presence, I expect Halliburton will deliver profitable growth, solid free cash flow and industry-leading returns and outperform as this upcycle accelerates. Now I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our first quarter financial results. Lance?
Lance Loeffler: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our first quarter results, compared to the first quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 24%. Adjusted operating income was $533 million, or a 44% increase compared to the operating income of $370 million in the first quarter of 2021. These results were primarily driven by increased activity across all regions and improved pricing in North America. In the first quarter, we recorded pre-tax charges of $64 million. Of these, impairments and other charges totaled $22 million, including $16 million of receivables related to the write-off of all of our assets in Ukraine. The remainder of the charges totaled $42 million and was related to the redemption premium and unamortized expenses associated with the early retirement of $600 million of our 2025 senior notes. Now let me discuss our division results in more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 26%, while operating income was $296 million or an increase of 17%. These results were primarily driven by increased pressure pumping services and artificial lift activity in the Western Hemisphere, higher completion tool sales throughout the Western Hemisphere in the Middle East, increased cementing activity in Africa and Middle East Asia, and improved well intervention services in North America land and the Eastern Hemisphere. These improvements were partially offset by lower activity across multiple product service lines in Europe and lower completion tool sales throughout Asia. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 22%, while operating income was $294 million or a 72% increase. These results were due to increased drilling related services globally; improved wireline activity in North America land, Latin America and the Middle East; increased testing services internationally; and higher project management activity in Latin America, India and Oman. Partially offsetting these increases were lower project management activity in Iraq as well as lower fluid services in the Caribbean, Brunei and Mozambique. Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 37%. This increase was primarily driven by improved pressure pumping activity and drilling related services in North America land, higher stimulation, artificial lift and drilling related activity in Canada and higher completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by reduced fluid services in the Gulf of Mexico. Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 22% due to improved activity across multiple product service lines in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico; increased well construction services in Colombia; higher completion tool sales in Guyana; improved project management activity in Ecuador and Colombia; increased testing services and wireline activity across the region; and increased artificial lift activity in Ecuador. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced fluid services in the Caribbean and lower project management and stimulation activity in Mexico. In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 7%. This improvement was primarily driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in Egypt, increased drilling-related activity in Azerbaijan, increased well intervention and testing services across the region, improved well construction services in West Africa, and higher completion tool sales and cementing activity in Angola. These increases were partially offset by reduced activity across multiple product service lines in the United Kingdom, reduced well construction services and completion tool sales in Norway and decreased fluid services in Mozambique. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 17%, primarily resulting from improved well construction services in Saudi Arabia and Oman, increased wireline activity and completion tool sales in the Middle East, and increased testing services across the region. These increases were partially offset by reduced project management activity in Iraq, lower completion tool sales throughout Asia, decreased fluid services in Brunei and lower stimulation activity in Bangladesh. Our corporate and other expense for the quarter totaled $57 million, and I expect that to serve as a good quarterly run rate for the remainder of the year. Net interest expense for the quarter was $107 million. I expect this level of interest expense to drift slightly lower in the second quarter as a result of a full quarter impact of our reduced debt balance. Our normalized effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 21%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $189 million. Our expected CapEx spend for the full year remains at approximately $1 billion, and we anticipate that our remaining capital expenditures will increase quarter-over-quarter into the end of the year. Our first quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow was a use of cash of $50 million and $183 million, respectively. These results were primarily driven by investment in working capital, consistent with our strong activity growth. As is typical for our business in an upcycle, we expect our cash flow to be back-end loaded for the year. We still expect to generate strong free cash flow for the remainder of 2022. Finally, turning to our near-term operational outlook, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect the seasonal revenue decline in software sales to be offset by further improvements in global drilling activity. Therefore, second quarter revenue is anticipated to grow low- to mid single-digits. As a result of the falloff of software sales, we expect D&E margins to decline 125 to 175 basis points. In the Completions and Production division, activity is accelerating globally and scarcity will drive pricing in North America in the second quarter. As such, we expect second quarter revenue to grow in the mid-teens and margins to improve 350 to 400 basis points. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Lance. Let me summarize what we've talked about today. We believe that this accelerating multi-year upcycle is different and more sustainable than prior cycles due to operators' focus on short-cycle barrels. Halliburton's strategic priorities are clear and effective and drive outperformance. Our technology portfolio and market presence mean that we are poised for profitable growth in the international markets. In the tight North America market, we remain focused on maximizing value and improving returns. And finally, I expect Halliburton to continue to deliver profitable growth, strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns in this up cycle. And now, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.
David Anderson: Hi. Good morning, Jeff. 
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Dave.
David Anderson: Your sales force in the U.S. has been playing defense the past five or six years, returns of software, but now your customers are actually reaping record cash flows basically on the back of low service cost. And as you said, equipment is essentially sold out in the U.S., activity is ramping up, oil's at 100, fundamentals are pretty tight. I'm not sure if I've ever seen a better environment to push pricing. So I was wondering if you could talk about this process. What are you telling your sales force now in terms of pricing? And more importantly, what's the pushback from E&P? I understand the sense of sticker shock, but the situation is only going to get worse a year from today. I don't see capacity being built, E&P costs are only going in one direction. If you could kind of frame your -- frame the whole pricing debate for me, I'd appreciate that. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: Yes. Yes, I will do that. Look, I think the most important -- I mean, obviously, pushing price all of the time, so guidance to the sales force is literally -- this is the amount of equipment, we expect it to earn more. And the sold-out conditions make that a lot clearer, certainly, for our folks and I think for our customers as well. And I think the other key here is, though, it's a more iterative process and it continues to be iterative. By that, I mean, we've moved on price and we'll continue to move on prices. We work certainly this quarter, next quarter and through the year. And so, I expect to continue to move that direction with price. I think it is a bit of a sticker shock, because you're seeing inflation across the entire sector. So we've got inputs that are going up meaningfully. Our own costs are going up meaningfully, and we're outpacing those costs in terms of net pricing. And so, I would describe it, I think you're accurate. It's more around sticker shock. I described last quarter, we were moving around a little bit between customers as customers, sort of, felt around in the marketplace for what's out there, what's possible. And so, I think that, obviously, we plan to continue moving.
David Anderson: So, Jeff, I recognize it's early to talk about 2023. A lot has changed over the last 90 days, though, especially kind of, if you think about kind of global hydrocarbon movement. I was wondering, is it fair to say that your top line expectations for next year have materially increased, particularly around the international outlook that you're talking about ramping up? And kind of -- and part of that is 35% incremental margins are sort of the baseline, I guess, if we talk about double-digit growth, but could that actually be closer to 40% or even 45% on how you see pricing particularly on that -- based on what we saw in the mid-2000s? So it doesn't seem like much of a stretch.
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, Dave, I'm really excited about the outlook. And what I don't want to do is get in the business of refining a two-year outlook every quarter. But clearly, every quarter trajectory changes. And I'm very excited about those changes. And I think everything we see, including what you described as energy security, sets up a busier North America, clearly and strong growth internationally. And what's key is we're seeing them both at the same time. And that's -- it's something we really haven't seen in a very long time and sets up very well for certainly us.
David Anderson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
James West: Hey, good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Lance.
Jeff Miller: Hey, good morning, James.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, James.
James West: So Jeff, you talked a lot about short-cycle barrels, which makes a ton of sense, given the situation the world's in now being short oil in a pretty significant way that, that would be the focus today. When do you think that, if it does, that the cycle turns into one of a more balanced mix of short-cycle barrels and some longer-cycle barrels, some of the more complex, maybe more offshore or just maybe bigger development-type projects?
Jeff Miller: Well, I think that what we see offshore generally today are tiebacks or development-type activity. But I think when I look further into the future, it's a combination of sort of ESG pressure is clearly one…
James West: Right.
Jeff Miller: …capital returns, returns is another key element of that. And I don't think those are changing anytime soon. And so what I think we see is a marketplace that's going to have more optionality clearly for our clients. And in some respects, for us as well. I mean that's the approach we've taken sort of longer-term maximizing value in North America is a view that we are going to be where we need to be. But clearly, in places where we have optionality also, I think you see that in sort of CapEx spend. And I think that we've done -- everything I see, it just takes a long time to get those things underway and lots of money upfront, and I just don't really see over a longer period of time, like I don't know -- I want to give you a time, but a much longer period of time, could we see that creep back in? We probably could, but I don't see it in the viewfinder today.
James West: Okay. Okay. That's fair enough. And then Jeff, we hear a lot about and we've been talking to a lot of the NOCs, particularly the ones in the Middle East and North Africa, who are reworking their budgets or have been over the last seven, eight weeks and using a little bit higher oil price estimation. And I'm curious what they're telling you and probably your competitors as well about how these budget increases will flow through? I mean these are, in some cases, fairly bureaucratic operators. And so their ability to change and to get capital into the field and get service companies lined up in rigs and frac spreads, et cetera, takes some time. So I know you're certainly more optimistic now than you were probably yesterday, a day before and six weeks ago, but are – do you think you see a lot of this in the back half, or are we really starting to talk about a 2023, 2024, 2025 story for a lot of these big NOCs?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think we're going to see building activity sooner than that. I think it builds throughout the balance of 2022 and then probably continues to get legs in 2023, likely beyond. I think the key is that $100 oil, everything is busy. And people want to be busy, but the question is, can they be busy? And what we've seen is really seven years of underinvestment around the entire world spending about half of what we used to spend. And that's not something that's overcome in a day or a year or – that just takes time to – to get momentum. And I talked there are clearly all of Middle East, not the same. Clearly, there are NOCs that take a very long view and will build into growing production over time. But that's not the case everywhere. Lot of activity for us, but I think – and we'll see that sooner. But I don't think that you see the real long cycle-type work. It's just going to take quite a bit of time.
James West: All right. All right. Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning, everybody.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, Chase.
Jeff Miller: Hey, Chase.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey, Jeff and hey, Lance. So I guess I wanted to follow-up on the margin guidance on the C&P side. Obviously, pretty strong sequential increase, I think you said 350 to 400 bps of margin improvement on the C&P side. So Lance, I don't know if you could step back and kind of walk us through some of the moving pieces. Obviously, 1Q was a little bit softer than we all thought. But just kind of walk us through price, so maybe some costs coming out or things just to help us kind of get confidence in that big sequential increase in margins on the C&P side?
Lance Loeffler: Yeah. And you're right, Chase. A lot of noise in Q1, we've discussed before sort of the air pocket that exists as we move across the calendar year with completion tool sales and the profitability that goes with that. And certainly, the headwinds that we faced with sand supply early in the first quarter. But I think the real underpinning of the guidance is what we're beginning to see now on pricing in North America, and it really beginning to take hold. I mean, as Jeff said, we've been very careful about the equipment we've told you were sold out. So it's not like we're adding incremental equipment. This is really a pricing story for North America as it begins to turn.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. I guess, the follow-up is really on pricing. Obviously, pretty tight US market, you're really starting to gain momentum on the pricing side. And Lance, if we were to kind of squint really hard and look at leading-edge pricing, can we say that leading-edge pricing is starting to feel like its back to kind of 2018 levels, or are we kind of a long way from being able to kind of make that comparison just yet?
Lance Loeffler: I think it's a little early, but I think that we're heading in that direction, and we'll get there, we'll eclipse that as we go throughout the course of the second and third quarter.
Jeff Miller: Yeah. I think what's important, though, Chase, is that it's not the marginal fleet at the front edge of the curve, it's really the entire business that needs to get the recovery. And I think that's what we're in the process of doing. So does the leading edge makes sense, yes. But the fact is, as I described in my comments, an incremental fleet is not really the decision point here, it's the recovery of the whole business in order to generate free cash flow.
Lance Loeffler: And improved returns.
Jeff Miller: Yes.
Chase Mulvehill: Great. Makes sense. I’ll turn it back over.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta: Good morning, team. Jeff, if I heard you right, you talked about North America growing 35% in terms of CapEx this year versus your previous estimate of 25%. Can you talk a little bit about what gives you confidence around that view? Is the composition of that more of the privates, or do you actually see it showing up in public E&Ps? And is that activity-driven, or is it inflation-driven? Any color around the margin because that's a material increase in your macro expectations.
Jeff Miller: Well, a lot of that inflation that we see. It's -- and obviously, there's been a lot of inflation if we just look at the cost of inputs separate from our own, we've seen inputs ranging and cost increases from 20% to 100%, depending on what the item is. And so that weighs on it. Rig counts up 45% if we were to stop today, frac crews are up 20% if we were to stop today and the cost of each of those are more. And so look, I think really what we're seeing is public companies will stick -- are sticking with activity outlook. It's not necessarily increasing activity. And then with privates, we continue to see more activity and they keep growing. And so I think that operators all have different strategies and are very, very sharp around this. And so I expect that they will manage their business the way they plan to manage it, but there's just no question that when I see inflation and activity and clearly privates, to make clear, the private growth is an important part of that outlook. We just -- my view is that we've moved up from where we were a quarter ago.
Neil Mehta: And Jeff, we clearly build in the rig count here and we're seeing an intention for to come into 2023 a little bit hotter from a production standpoint. But when we talk to producers, the constraint continues to be around labor and pressure pumping equipment. Do you see new capacity being added into the market by your competitors? And ultimately, will that be a constraint on the US production profile over the next couple of years?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I think it will be a constraint. I'm going to go back to my earlier remarks about a closed-loop system and terms of generating cash in order to build equipment and there’s a lot of equipment repair that needs to still happen or replacement in the marketplace. So I think that will be a constraint, labor and certainly equipment. And that's one of the reasons we take a very long view of fleet health, and we've got one of the healthiest fleets in the marketplace. But inside of our capital budget, we're always replacing aging equipment, and we're looking ahead today to 2023 and 2024 in terms of what that fleet composition needs to look like. So we're unique in that regard in terms of where we sit. But I do think that we don't -- I don't see capacity and I don't see meaningful capital to support any kind of build cycle at this point. Reality is this industry is still in recovery mode.
David Anderson: Thank you, guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Scott Gruber: Yes, good morning. I just want to come back to the C&P margin outlook, especially given what's happening in the marketplace here with your improvement in frac pricing. When I look at the margins and the incrementals, obviously a lot of noise in 1Q, which you've talked about, but when I look at margins embedded in your guide versus the second half of last year, that the incremental still look pretty modest. But going forward, obviously, a building completion tool backlog, frac prices improving, but obviously, pretty stout inflation coming through the system. How should we think about those factors impacting C&P incrementals in the second half? Can we see incrementals rise into the 40s, although inflation constrained those incrementals kind of in the 30s? How should we think about it?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Well, if we look at the Q2, I mean, the way you described it, everything we're doing is driving better margins in C&P, whether it's the operating leverage in the business, moving on price, equipment is tight. I think the Q2 guide is -- puts us in that sort of range. Yes, there's a lot of inflation on other inputs to the business that we are recovering, but even recovering the cost of those other inputs will have a bit of a dilutive impact on overall margins, but that doesn't change the recovery for us and the speed and the momentum of that recovery. And so I feel very good about where we're going and expect incrementals to be at the high end of what a range would be as we move through this process.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Got it. And one of the concerns we've heard just on the capturing the next round of pricing in frac is just around timing. Your pricing leverage is improving. But I guess the question is, when do you see the next round really hitting? Is that kind of in 2Q, 3Q, or do we have to wait until kind of late in the year in the next budget season to really see a -- the next big step-up? How quickly does the next round of pricing in frac [indiscernible]?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Yes, look -- crazy to get into the strategy for different customers and where we are. But obviously, this is an iterative process, meaning it's not something we wait until next year to do again. It's something that we are doing sort of in real time on a very regular basis. And so I expect -- we're in a $100 oil environment here. And this is part of the cost of delivering $100 oil. And so, a healthy recovering industry, we will continue to iterate on price as we move through the year, not planning for next year.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Understood. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Ian Macpherson: Good morning team. The situation in Russia has shifted the paradigm not only for crude, obviously, but also natural gas and coal, both of which land on the shoulders of natural gas everywhere else. So, we've seen that strip move radically recently. What do you think the customer response will be from US and international producers of natural gas with regard to activity response to what might be a structural higher strip just like crude that maybe hasn't shown up yet in the fundamentals of your business through April?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, I think, Ian, that has to strengthen certainly in terms of activity, and I expect we'll see that in the important gas-producing countries internationally, we will see more of that activity and even likely in the US. But the fact is, there still are some important constraints in place around pipeline capacity and whatnot that is serving to keep some of that market constrained today. But look, our business in the gas basins is improving and is busy and really not too dissimilar from kind of the demand response or the activity response that we see from oil.
Ian Macpherson: Okay. And then, Jeff, just going back to the outlook on C&P margins. You -- obviously, there was significant weather and sand bottlenecks that distorted Q1 and you have a healthy recovery guided for Q2. But does your margin guidance for Q2 for C&P embed an assumption that the sand problem is sort of contained fully now, or do you -- or is that an area for remaining incremental recovery of margins from enduring bottleneck on sand as you've guided Q2 later in the year?
Jeff Miller: No, I think the sand is largely behind us. That was a good example of underinvestment in supply chain. And as it was turned back on, it had a lot of maintenance, lack of maintenance thereof, and we even participated with some of our vendors to help them get things back online and I believe that's largely behind us. Look, I think the important point here is this trend is moving up. We're going to see all sorts of things, but our guide accounts for sort of all of the things that we see. And I think that we are just in this place where we're going to continue seeing improvement sort of over whatever the labor bottlenecks happen to be, those are going to all be overcome consistently as we move through year and really beyond. I mean I think that we'll continue to power through all of that and continue to see solid incremental growth at margins.
Ian Macpherson: Super. Thanks Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Connor Lynagh: Yes. Thank you. I know it's a bit early to say precisely, but just returning to the topic of international pricing. Do you see meaningful constraints in either your available equipment in select markets or your availability of labor, or is that more of a US issue at this point?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think a lot of the same tightness discussion that we talk about in the US is similar internationally. It comes in smaller pockets generally because it's 70 countries as opposed to one. But we're seeing more tightness in tools, clearly in people, and I think that's what's driving extensions today. I described the increase in the number of extensions we are seeing at higher prices. That's a great sign. But that's really predicated on tightening markets and the importance of having services available. Equipment is getting tighter. New work is pricing better. It moves more slowly than the US, so it may be a little less pronounced, but I expect that, that continues to improve. The large tenders remain competitive, but the fact is they're soaking up noticeable equipment. And in fact, some of that tightness in the marketplace is creating opportunity for Halliburton.  There are a number of situations where, because of our supply chain and access to raw materials and products, we were able to supply when others could not. And so, I think that's a real -- that's the evidence that, that market is getting tighter. When we get a third call from a customer says, hey, do you have anything' and we're able to supply it, that's an indicator that the market is getting tighter.
Connor Lynagh: Got it. That's helpful color. Just on the supply chain side of things, there's obviously been a lot changing in the world over the last month or two here. Have you had any sort of hot spots that you're monitoring? Are there any areas that, we should think about being -- something we should be watching as you ramp activity through the back half of the year here?
Jeff Miller: No, I don't think so. I mean I think what we're going to just see is the lengthening of delivery times. Things take longer to deliver, and therefore, planning matters more than ever. Obviously planning on our part, but also planning on the parts of our customers. And again, it is creating opportunity for us. And I think along the way, the key here is, we can't and won't subsidize operators in this process. So, we've been very transparent in terms of the cost to acquire things, the timing to acquire things. And I think that, again, our supply chain organization is very sophisticated and it outperforms. And so, I put Halliburton right at the top of that when it comes to solving those kinds of shortages, bottlenecks, whatever it may be.
Connor Lynagh: Got it. Thank you very much.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Your line is open.
Stephen Gengaro: Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. 
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Stephen.
Stephen Gengaro: Two things for me. Just to start with, with the world evolving and you mentioned kind of the pull on short-cycle barrels, how do you think about CapEx? How do you think about investing in assets which have 5-year-plus lives in an environment where things have changed so dramatically?
Jeff Miller: Well, we look at that returns on that equipment inside the time that we know it will work. And so, it much of that at all. Anything that we're doing, we've got line of sight to not only the initial project, but its full cycle return, and expect that to get returned in the life of that contract. I'd use eFleets as an example of that, where our view is, they have to make a return on capital and a return of capital inside of the time it goes -- its initial contract. And we view a lot of things that way. And so, I think just as operators sort of retain flexibility – budget flexibility around what they choose to do, we're doing the same.  And that's what allows us really in my view, to confidently drive profitable growth internationally, which D&E margins are an example of that, and then also maximize value in North America, which is our approach to North America is demonstrating that also. And so I really like our strategy very much, and I think it's very consistent with the kind of market that we see unfolding.
Stephen Gengaro: Thanks. And I guess the follow-up, just when you think about -- and you mentioned the concentration of frac equipment in the hands of just a few operators now and you've seen consolidation. Have you seen behavioral change from -- in general, just from all the players in the market? Do you think it's just a function of the market being sold out? Do you think other -- your competitors are truly acting better when it comes to pricing?
Jeff Miller: Look, I can't comment there. I mean, what I see is an industry broadly that has underperformed for a long time. And I know in our own case, for Halliburton, in order to reinvest in even replacement equipment, we need fundamentals that are better and returns that are higher in order to generate the cash back to my point around maximizing value in North America. We're only going to do that if the investment is produced by the equipment that is working in the marketplace. And so independent of what others are doing, that's what we are doing. And when I look across the marketplace, I see a whole industry that has largely suffered the same thing. And so that's just pure economics at work there.
Stephen Gengaro: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Thank you, Michelle. Look, before we end the call, let me just close with these comments. I am confident in my outlook on the strength of this market upcycle. And I expect Halliburton will deliver profitable growth, strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns as this upcycle accelerates. The pivot to short-cycle barrels only confirms this upcycle staying power. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Michelle, let's close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-01-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Halliburton’s Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to David Coleman, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
David Coleman: Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2021 conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton’s website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter earnings release or in the Quarterly Results & Presentations section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. 2021 finished strong for Halliburton, and I’m excited about the accelerating upcycle as we enter 2022. We have an effective value proposition and benefit from increasing activity both in North America and international markets. At the same time, we see improving service pricing in both markets. Throughout this upcycle I expect Halliburton to grow profitably, accelerate free cash flow generation, strengthen our balance sheet, and increase cash returns to shareholders. But first, I want to take a minute and recognize the men and women of Halliburton for their execution on every dimension of our business: safety, service quality, and financial results. In spite of global complexity in 2021, you outperformed. So, to all of our employees, thank you. I believe 2022 will be a strong year for our industry and especially for Halliburton. While global energy demand and economic growth demonstrated resilience, global energy supply has shown its fragility. The impact of several years of underinvestment in new production is now apparent and the structural requirement to invest around the wellbore is crystal clear. We see increasing customer urgency and a pivot back to what creates value for Halliburton. Our customers demand reliable execution, dependable supply chains, effective technology, and a collaborative service provider to maximize asset value. And this is at the core of Halliburton’s unique value proposition. But first, I’ll highlight some of our 2021 accomplishments. We finished the year with total Company revenue of $15.3 billion, and operating income of $1.8 billion. Both of Halliburton’s divisions grew revenue and margins this year. Our Completion and Production division finished the year with 15% operating margin, driven by activity improvement, despite inflationary pressures. We expect to build on this margin growth in 2022, as global activity and pricing improve. Our Drilling and Evaluation division margins remained firmly in double digits throughout 2021 and achieved full year margins of 12% for the first time since 2014. This is a good demonstration of our steady March forward, and we are not done. I’m pleased with the trajectory of our international business. International revenue and operating income increased every quarter in 2021. In North America, Halliburton achieved 36% incrementals year-on-year as U.S. land activity rebounded, and we maximized the value of our business. We announced our science-based emission reduction targets, added 11 new participating companies to Halliburton labs and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which highlights the top 10% most sustainable companies in each industry. Finally, we generated strong free cash flow of $1.4 billion and ended the year with $3 billion of cash on hand, even after the retirement of $685 million of long-term debt in 2021. Next, let me share a few highlights from our fourth quarter performance. Total Company revenue increased 11%, and operating income grew 20% sequentially. Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 10% sequentially and operating income increased 8% with completion tool sales showing the highest third to fourth quarter improvement in the last 15 years. Equally important, our current completion tool order book has more than doubled from a year ago, signaling strong growth and profitability again in 2022. Our Drilling and Evaluation division grew revenue 11%, which outperformed the global rig count growth for the quarter and delivered over 300 basis points of sequential margin improvement. International and North America revenue grew 11% and 10% respectively due to strong year-end sales and activity increases across all regions. Building on this strong foundation of disciplined execution, today we announced two important strategic steps we are taking to further create value for our shareholders. First, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2022. This action reflects our confidence in Halliburton’s strong cash generation capacity. Second, in order to accelerate debt retirement and strengthen our balance sheet, we’re redeeming $600 million of our $1 billion in debt maturing in 2025. When these notes are redeemed in February, we will have retired $1.8 billion of debt since the beginning of 2020. These steps demonstrate my confidence in our business, customers, employees, and value proposition. As I discussed with you on recent earnings calls, I expect the macro industry environment to remain supportive, and as we saw in 2021, the international and North America markets will continue their simultaneous growth. This is momentum that I have not seen in a long time. With this momentum, we plan to execute our unique strategic priorities, deliver profitable growth internationally, maximize value in North America, accelerate digital and automation deployment, improve capital efficiency and advance a sustainable energy future. Let’s discuss how we plan to do this. First, internationally, our strategy is to deliver profitable growth. We allocate capital to the highest returns opportunities, which means we are selective on what we bid for and win. Our D&E margin performance in 2021 is a demonstration of this discipline. We continue to invest in technology, both digital and hardware, that maximizes asset value. In 2021, we brought to market over 50 new technologies, including our iStar intelligent formation evaluation platform and the next generation of our iCruise system for harsh drilling environments. Our multiyear investment in drilling technologies is paying off, and we expect to outgrow the market as international drilling activity ramps up. We have unique international growth opportunities in specialty chemicals and artificial lift. As Halliburton expands the international footprint of these businesses, we have a pipeline of opportunities that are longer cycle and should be margin-accretive. Halliburton’s size, scale and sophisticated supply chain and HR teams reliably execute for our customers in the face of supply shortages and labor tightness. Second, in the structurally smaller North American market, our strategy is to maximize cash flow, and it dictates how we approach our North America business. Strong cash flow starts with strong margins, and Halliburton’s margins are the best in class. We completed the most aggressive set of structural cost reductions in our history. We also made significant changes to our processes that drive higher contribution margin, for example, how we perform equipment maintenance and provide engineering support. These changes give us meaningful operating leverage as North American activity accelerates. We consistently replace equipment as it wears out and avoid outsized recapitalization requirements. And we have the right type of equipment. We are the leaders in the low-emissions equipment segment. We believe this gives us a structural pricing advantage as operators are willing to pay a premium for differentiated, more environmentally friendly solutions. Our second generation Zeus electric fracturing technology is working in the field today and delivers results for a growing list of customers. Importantly, in addition to emissions reduction, electric fracturing technology provides unprecedented operational control and precision. For example, Zeus makes pumping rate adjustments at least 4 times faster than a diesel pump, allowing us to respond to surface and subsurface changes more quickly than with a conventional frac spread and precisely execute the job design. We expect fully electric locations to become a larger share of the market. Halliburton has the right kit, including our Zeus electric pumping unit, the ExpressBlend blending system, the eWinch electric wireline unit and the electric tech command center to meet the market demand for lower-emitting fracturing operations. We develop differentiated technologies to focus around the wellbore. As the oil price and customer urgency increase, these technologies become more valuable to operators. For example, our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing solution helps customers optimize fracturing performance and maximize production. Several large operators will have smart fleet working on multi-pad completion programs this year. Additionally, SmartFleet delivers fully automated frac operations, which ensures more consistent fracture placement on every stage, improves cluster uniformity and manages offset frac hits. Finally, I want to highlight the importance of our well construction and production service lines. They each have unique competitive advantage and technology to maximize value in North America. Third, our strategy is to advance digitalization and automation in all aspects of our business. Our digital investments drive higher margins through customer purchases of software, smarter tools and ancillary products, and cost savings for Halliburton. Let me give you an example. Currently, 100% of Halliburton’s drilling jobs run on a cloud-based, real-time system to deliver data and visualization to our customers around the world. Close to 60% of iCruise operations are fully automated, allowing for up to a 70% reduction in headcount per rig. Automation alleviates health and safety concerns by removing personnel from rigs, accelerates service delivery improvements and reduces the environmental footprint of oil and gas operations. Our fourth strategic priority is to drive capital efficiency across the balance sheet. This positions Halliburton to generate industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow as markets grow. We will optimize the working capital required to grow our business and maintain our CapEx in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue. Our business thrives in this range because of our research and development efforts and process changes. These allow us to build tools cheaper, lengthen their run life and move assets quicker to where they make the most money. Our final strategic priority is to advance a sustainable energy future. Our clean energy accelerator, Halliburton Labs, continues to add new participants. We help these early-stage companies achieve important scaling milestones and significantly increase their enterprise value. Through Halliburton Labs, we are actively participating in the clean energy space without committing shareholder capital. Halliburton will evolve as energy evolves, and we will add to our already expanding opportunities to participate as clean energy value chains mature. However, we will do so consistent with our capital allocation strategy and mindful of our commitment to deliver industry-leading returns and free cash flow generation. We will proceed with patience, discipline and resolve. Now, let’s review our fourth quarter 2021 performance and expectations for 2022. As OPEC+’s spare capacity returns to normalized levels this year, we believe sufficient pent-up oil demand will support a call on both international and U.S. production, and lead to increased activity. International activity accelerated in most markets in the second half of the year and finished strong in the fourth quarter with a 23% rig count increase year-on-year. All Halliburton regions grew revenue, led by Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa with both of our divisions contributing to the revenue and margin expansion. I’m excited about our future international growth. Despite typical first quarter seasonality, we are starting 2022 a lot higher than where we entered 2021. I expect our customers’ international spend to increase by mid-teens this year. We anticipate projects in the Middle East, Russia and Latin America to attract the most investment with activity increases in Africa and Europe limited to a few markets. Asset owners are eager to reverse base production declines caused by multiple years of underinvestment. We expect that operators will focus on shorter cycle production opportunities to meet increasing oil demand. This disproportionately benefits Halliburton as these short-cycle barrels require higher service intensity and spending directly focused on the wellbore as opposed to long-cycle infrastructure investments. In 2022, we expect to deliver steady, profitable growth across the international markets. Our tender pipeline is strong. We anticipate higher utilization for our existing equipment in busy markets like the Middle East, Russia and Latin America. We plan to allocate our capital dollars to the opportunities that generate the highest return. Given the tool tightness that exists today in some product lines and geographies, we intend to strategically reallocate assets to drive improved utilization and returns. A tightening market focuses our ongoing pricing discussions with customers. We see pricing traction on new work and contract renewals, including integrated contracts. Additionally, we have introduced pay-for-performance models, negotiated favorable terms and conditions and applied price escalation clauses. While large tenders remain competitive, we are consistent with our strategy to pursue profitable growth. Turning to North America. In 2021, the recovery in North America was faster and more pronounced than in the international markets. In the fourth quarter, U.S. land rig count increased 84% year-on-year, and drilling activity outpaced completions as operators prepared well inventory for 2022 programs. Completed stage count growth moderated slightly due to the holidays, sand supply tightness and lower efficiency levels typically experienced in the winter months. In the fourth quarter, we finished the plant upgrade of all fracturing fleets to the next generation fluid end technology that extends the life of our equipment and helps reduce maintenance cost. We expect a busy 2022 in North America. Given a strong commodity price environment, we anticipate North America customer spending to grow more than 25% year-on-year. We believe the highest increase will come from private operators. Public E&Ps will continue to prioritize returns while delivering production into a supportive market. In North America, Halliburton uniquely benefits as the largest oilfield services provider in the largest oilfield services market in the world. We anticipate solid net pricing gains in North America throughout 2022. Here’s why. The North America completions market is approaching 90% utilization, and Halliburton is sold out. Pricing for our fracturing fleets is moving higher across the board, both for our market-leading low-emissions equipment and our Tier 4 diesel fleets. As a result, we expect to see over 30% incrementals in our hydraulic fracturing business in the first quarter. Anticipated demand growth for equipment provides a runway for us to increase pricing throughout the year. We expect some market-wide operational efficiencies afforded by completing a backlog of DUCs in 2021 to reverse as frac fleets return to the usual mode of following drilling rigs. This will further increase the call on equipment as operators add rigs throughout the year. Finally, during the tendering season, we secured net pricing increases across several different non-frac product service lines: drilling, cementing, fluids, drill bits and artificial lift. As activity accelerates, the market is seeing tightness related to trucking, labor, sand and other inputs. While we pass these increased costs on to operators, Halliburton has effective solutions that minimize the operational impact of this tightness and provide reliable execution for our customers. As an example, in 2021, we expanded our collaboration with Vorto and now benefit from 5F, the largest integrated transportation platform in the oil and gas industry. This platform has several-thousand drivers, hundreds of carriers and a chain of asset maintenance yards. It allows us to effectively manage trucking inflation and availability constraints and significantly reduce logistics-related nonproductive time. Our human resources team and systems effectively mitigate local labor tightness. We recruit nationally and hire, train and manage a commuter workforce that makes up to 80% of our personnel in some areas. There is no doubt the much anticipated multiyear upcycle is now underway. North America production growth remains capped by operators’ capital discipline, while meaningful international production growth is challenged by years of underinvestment. Energy demand has proven its resilience, fueled by pent-up economic growth and a global desire to return to normalcy. This is a fantastic set of conditions for Halliburton. In a strong commodity price environment with limited production growth options, operators turn to short-cycle barrels and increased spend around the wellbore. Our value proposition works. We have the right strategies for both international and North American markets. We are leaders in digital and automation, and we drive capital efficiency while advancing a sustainable energy future. I fully expect that Halliburton will accelerate cash flow generation, strengthen our balance sheet and increase cash returns to shareholders in this upcycle. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our fourth quarter financial results. Lance?
Lance Loeffler: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, an increase of 11%. Operating income was $550 million, a 20% increase compared to the adjusted operating income of $458. These results were primarily driven by increased global drilling activity and end-of-year product and software sales. Now, let me discuss our division results in a little more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division. Revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 10%, while operating income was $347 million or an 8% increase. These results were primarily driven by higher completion tool sales globally as well as increased pressure pumping services in North America land and the Middle East/Asia region. These improvements were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Latin America, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico; lower pipeline services in Europe/Africa/CIS and Asia; reduced well intervention services in Brazil; and decreased artificial lift activity in North America land. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 11%, while operating income was $269 million or a 45% increase. These results were due to increased drilling-related services globally, wireline sales in Guyana, improved project management activity in Ecuador and India, increased wireline activity in the Middle East/Asia region, and higher software sales in Latin America and Middle East/Asia. Partially offsetting these increases were decreased project management activity and testing services in Mexico as well as lower drilling-related activity in Russia. Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 10%. This increase was primarily driven by higher pressure pumping activity and drilling-related services in North America land in addition to higher completion tool sales and fluid services in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by reduced stimulation activity in Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, coupled with reduced artificial lift activity in North America land. Turning to Latin America. Revenue increased 7% sequentially. This improvement was driven by higher project management activity in Ecuador, increased drilling-related services in Mexico, increased activity across multiple product service lines in Brazil, wireline sales in Guyana, and higher activity across multiple product service lines in Colombia. These increases were partially offset by reduced project management and stimulation activity and testing services in Mexico. In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue increased 8% sequentially. These results were partially driven by higher software and completion tool sales across the region, improved activity across multiple product service lines in Norway and Egypt, and increased well control activity in Nigeria. These improvements were partially offset by reduced activity in multiple product service lines in Russia, reduced pipeline services and well construction activity in the United Kingdom, and decreased stimulation activity in the Congo. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 16%, resulting from higher completion tool sales and wireline activity across the region, improved well construction services in Saudi Arabia and Oman, higher software sales in Kuwait and China, improved project management activity in India, and increased stimulation activity throughout Asia. These increases were partially offset by reduced pipeline services in Asia, along with lower activity across multiple product service lines in Vietnam. Now, I’d like to address some additional financial items. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $66 million, which was slightly higher than expected due to an increase in legal reserves. For the first quarter, we expect our corporate expense to be about $60 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $108 million, slightly lower than anticipated due to higher interest income from our cash balance. Today, we announced our decision to redeem $600 million of the 2025 senior notes using cash on hand. This action will reduce future cash interest expense and reflects our desire to continue reducing debt balances. As a result of the debt retirement in late February, our net interest expense should remain roughly flat in the first quarter. During the quarter, we recognized a noncash gain of approximately $500 million due to the partial release of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets. This reversal is based on the improved market conditions and reflects our increased expectation to utilize these deferred tax assets going forward. Our normalized effective tax rate for the fourth quarter came in at approximately 23%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2022 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately the same. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $316 million with our 2021 full year CapEx totaling approximately $800 million. In 2022, we intend to increase our capital expenditures to approximately $1 billion while remaining within our target of 5% to 6% of revenue. We believe that this level of spend will equip us well to execute on our strategic priorities and take advantage of the accelerating market recovery. Turning to cash flow. We generated nearly $700 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and delivered approximately $1.4 billion of free cash flow for the full year. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $3 billion in cash. I’ve spoken before about our ability to concurrently reduce debt and increase the return of cash to shareholders, and today, we put that into action. This is a great start to a longer term goal of returning more cash to shareholders. Now, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end product sales, which will mostly impact our international and Gulf of Mexico businesses. However, we expect pricing recovery in North America to help offset these dynamics. As a result, in our Completion and Production division, we anticipate sequential revenue and margins to be essentially flat to the fourth quarter. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect revenue to decrease in the mid-single digits sequentially, while margins are expected to be flat to down 50 basis points. I’d now like to turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Lance. To summarize our discussion today, we see customer urgency and demand for our services increasing internationally and in North America. We expect our strong international business to continue its profitable growth as activity ramps up throughout the year. In the critical North America market, we expect our business to grow and improve margins. We prioritize our investments to the highest-return opportunities and remain committed to capital efficiency. We continue to play a role in advancing cleaner and more affordable energy solutions. In 2022, I expect Halliburton to deliver margin expansion, industry-leading returns and solid free cash flow. And now, let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West, Evercore ISI.
James West: So, Jeff, maybe just to kick us off here, could you talk a bit about the cadence of this cycle? You mentioned several times growth and you also mentioned a key word, which is urgency from customers. And I think that’s going to be something that’s very important when we think about pricing, margins, et cetera. Could you talk about how you see both, North America and the international markets and the cadence of the increases in activity, growth and how you and the broader industry, but you particularly, are expecting things to unfold here as we go through ‘22 and into ‘23 and beyond?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Well, thanks, James. Look, I really like the macro setup, and I have said that before. And what we really see is the fragility, as I described it, of supply and the returning demand. And so, I think, there are factors that the underinvestment internationally means that has to be recovered over a longer period of time. And I think a lot of the return expectations of this industry in North America are still in place and such that is a bit of a cap on production growth. But nevertheless, the activity, that just means a longer upcycle in my view. And I feel really good about the cadence, meaning it continues to move up this year, next year and beyond. And the way that sets up for us is we got -- we have an opportunity to take advantage of the operating leverage that’s already in our business. The pricing environment will be good throughout that period as equipment gets tighter everywhere and our technology is more valuable to customers in this kind of environment. And yes, activity, I believe, does ramp, and it’s going to be the kind of short-cycle barrels that drive the most activity for us because this is urgently trying to return barrels to market under those sort of constraints, very good for us. And so, as we look out to 2023, I’ll just start there, look out to 2023, I don’t see 2023 as an endpoint by any means. I think the road goes on well beyond that. But I can tell you what we’ve talked about for 2023 is biased higher.
James West: Right. Okay, okay. Makes sense to me. And that’s clearly in line with our expectations. How are -- Jeff and Lance, the dividend increase -- solid dividend increase, how do you think about and how are you guys thinking about shareholder returns going forward as we kind of move into -- well, we’re into, but I guess is being accelerated into this upcycle?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, thanks, James. I’ll take that. Look, those were important actions that we took to date. And we expect to continue, continue finding opportunities to return more cash to shareholders and pay down debt. And as we pay down debt, that creates headroom in our fixed payments as we pay down debt. And think about it, we’ve repaid $1.8 billion of debt since January of 2020. And we get through ‘23 and ‘25, as debt is paid. The next maturity is not until 2030. And so we fully -- I fully expect to continue growing shareholder distributions as the upcycle accelerates.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dave Anderson with Barclays.
Dave Anderson: I just want to ask about C&P margins during the quarter and then thinking about the progression for next year. Highlighted completion tool sales end, but margins kind of slipped a bit during the quarter. And then, Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you had talked about completion tool orders have doubled since last year. So, I’m just trying to understand what all that means in terms of the mix. Obviously, we have the kind of the pressure pumping price in there. If you could just kind of help us understand how that margin should kind of move.
Jeff Miller: Well, look, yes, I mean, as we look at 2021, for example, 15% margins, I’m pleased with those. We got a lot of important work done in our frac business in Q4, which I talked about in my comments, but getting fluid ends installed and then raising prices involves moving equipment around. And so, we probably had 10% of our fleet moving as we raised price and got moved to different customers that were happy with the new price. And so that’s Q4. As we look at the order book doubling in completion tools, that’s really a look ahead to 2022, and that’s very positive for 2022 to see those types of longer lead items building in our order book. I think when we think about progression in 2022, I expect to see 30% incrementals in our frac business in North America in 2022 in first quarter, but what that -- mixed in with that are the completion tools that don’t repeat in Q1. But the reality is we are filling a big hole largely with recurring pricing and the kind of sticky things that we plan to build on. And we still get the 2022 doubling of the order book at some point during the year of 2022 in completion tools. I hope that’s some clarity.
Dave Anderson: That is. That’s great, Jeff. And if I could just shift -- well, I guess, somewhat related question. I want to ask about kind of further e-frac deployment and kind of how you see that developing over the next several years. It’s pretty clear that E&Ps are increasingly looking to reduce emissions. They’re going to need to reduce emissions. E-frac is clearly part of that solution. But of course, it costs more with the power source. I think you’re at like 5 or 6 fleets today. Maybe you could just update us where you are there. But I’m just kind of wondering kind of thinking out the next 12, 18 months, is it possible you could kind of double that deployment? But I guess even more important, do you think E&Ps are willing to underwrite this with longer-term contracts?
Jeff Miller: Let me unpack that a little bit. Just from an e-fleet deployment standpoint, we view e-fleet as replacements for our current equipment. So, the pacing of that is consistent with how we think about sort of fleet management over time. And obviously, that is contingent upon getting the terms and conditions and pricing that are clearly returning above what anything else is returning, and that’s what motivates us there. All of that lives inside of our CapEx outlook of 5% to 6% of revenue. So, I just want to keep all of that sort of in the right frame. We think about power, however, that is a unique piece of this puzzle. And what I expect happens with electric broadly is, yes, it grows, our share will grow of that. I think we’ve got fantastic equipment in the market working today. But the power piece, we’re power-agnostic. And if you recall, over time, I’ve always said, the issue here was the power, who owns the power. And I think we’ve partnered with a very good firm, successful firm that has modular power such that over time, as operators can optimize power sources, meaning the grid, our partner has the ability to scale that back and sort of optimize along with clients. And so, I think that’s the sort of unique power component that we solve for with both the grid.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Jeff, I wanted to start on the 400 basis-point margin increase target for 2023. As you look at that, what do you think represents the biggest risk to achieving it? And how do you feel about upside scenarios, and what factors could drive that?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, thanks, Neil. I’m excited and encouraged about what I see, more so today than I was before, which was all the -- it’s basically the simultaneous growth, North America and international and the -- effectively, the demand for equipment that we see, which now allows both activity and price to move at the same time. So I don’t -- from a risk perspective, look, I think that we’re in a good place to manage those risks that might be out there, whether it’s a range of things. But all of those things appear to be manageable, particularly given how important producing oil clearly is to really our way of life, but also the markets see that. And so, I think that demand for activity will be there. Clearly, that’s going to be biased higher at this point as we look out to 2023. And I think we’re in a great position to take advantage of all of those things that happen, whether it’s price and tightness, it’s our technology. There’s more demand for our technology in this kind of environment because it is our technology that -- drilling technology, for example, that help operators find more barrels nearby the wellbore, helps them do a lot of things that are important to them to accelerate their own production at an effective price.
Neil Mehta: And there’s been a lot of questions about where we are in terms of frac fleet utilization. I’d love your perspective on that. How do you see this market as tight and if you’d be willing to put a number on utilization? And how should we think about net service pricing in U.S. fracs for the back half of ‘22 and into ‘23, especially as you get some of these new built low-emission frac fleets starting to enter the market once again?
Jeff Miller: Well, we see it as close to 90% utilized as a market for equipment that’s existing today. And so, it doesn’t take much increase in activity to continue to tighten that, and I see that tightening more so in the back half of next year. The electric equipment as it comes into the market, a testament to our R&D organization, but we were able to bring that technology to market very quickly. It’s best in class, and that’s one of the reasons it’s going to work. And that team along with partners solve for sort of the power dilemma. And so, I think we’re in a great place to bring equipment to market. But clearly, that is new capital into the market, which requires higher returns than what we certainly have seen. And so, I think a cap on that’s going to be the requirement for higher returns. I think capital is -- capital for building equipment, clearly in short supply and particularly because there’s a lot of repair to come for returns in North America. So, a lot of that informs our strategy of maximizing value in North America means we approach it differently. It’s not can we grow -- build the most equipment? Can we maximize the most cash flow out of that market? And we think electric fleets positioned the right way help us do that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan.
Arun Jayaram: My first question is you guys have repositioned assets, frac fleets to improve utilization returns. And I just wanted to ask is absent pricing gains, what kind of tailwinds do you think that these types of actions could provide to margins as well as we think about adoption of SmartFleet and other Hal 4.0 offerings?
Jeff Miller: Well, we move equipment to raise margins. And I expect that we will see that kind of margin improvement into 2022. You mentioned SmartFleet. I think that’s a key component of what makes Halliburton unique in the fracs business in North America, and it’s one of the unique things of being -- of our large peers, we’re the only one in the frac business in North America, and that allows our technology budget is meaningful. And I think over time, applied consistently R&D investment has always been what moves this industry both from a productivity standpoint and a return standpoint for us. And so SmartFleet being but an example of what that R&D at scale looks like when it’s applied to North America. And so, yes, I think that does contribute to margins as does electric fleets as the many other sort of technology solutions that we’re working on all of the time.
Arun Jayaram: Fair enough. And my second question is, you guys mentioned in your prepared remarks about what’s going on with DUCs. DUCs have been down for 18 months in a row, and you’re starting to see the mix of drilling increase over time. I know that DUCs have been a tailwind for operators and led to, call it, lower frac needs in last year and the year before. And I know it’s difficult to measure, but I just wanted to know if you could maybe measure or quantify what kind of tailwind do you think this could provide the frac demand if the current fleet count’s around 235 or so?
Jeff Miller: Well, you’re thinking about it the right way. And I expect that it does increase demand just because there’s going to be more disruption in the system, meaning fleets will have to follow rigs. That will then create demand for more fleet. Yes, if we’re at 90%, clearly, we sort of run to the end of that quite quickly and expect the entire market needs to get better from a price standpoint. And I expect that we will see that as it gets -- we’re seeing it now. I think that is a dynamic that will continue certainly throughout the balance of this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.
Chase Mulvehill: So Lance, I guess, maybe this question’s for you, just thinking about the 1Q guide. I guess, I can kind of connect the dots with the C&P margins being flat because you’ve got completion tool sales kind of rolling off and obviously frac getting better. But thinking about the D&E side, resilient margins as we get into 1Q, and typically, you have software sales in the fourth quarter. So, just maybe help us kind of connect the dots here between 4Q and 1Q with kind of flat to down 50 bps on the D&E side because typically, you see some seasonality in the Eastern Hemisphere and you have software sales that will be rolling off. So, do you have some -- maybe some software sales that kind of linger into first quarter? Or just kind of help us understand the resiliency of margins in the first quarter.
Lance Loeffler: We do, Chase. It’s a good question. We do. So, in our software business, the way that we recognize revenue is sort of spread now between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So, we still have some resiliency from the software sales. But I wouldn’t discount what we’re doing on the drilling side. You heard Jeff talk about it in his prepared remarks. We’re really excited about what that means for our business. I mean, clearly, we have the weather-driven seasonality that will continue, and that’s always something that exists during the real hard winter months in places like the North Sea and Russia, in particular. But I really think that we’re excited about what the drilling business and the change that we’re making and the impact that’s coming from sort of that investment that we made in rekitting Sperry, for example, is really beginning to pay off.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. And then, a follow-up, obviously, you said multiple times here, 90% utilization of frac. But there is some cold-stacked equipment that may or may not come off the sidelines. Obviously, it depends on pricing. I guess maybe could you give us some comments -- or your comments around cold-stacked equipment? How much pricing would have to move for people to spend $10-plus-million because you probably converted some of those from Tier 2 to Tier 4 DGB? So just how much would pricing have to move for the industry to start kind of reactivating and spending more on cold-stacked reactivations?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think prices would have to move a long way. And some of the conversion you’re talking about, that’s dramatic. That’s open heart surgery. Getting from Tier 2 to Tier 4 is not something that happened simply. And it’s really going against the direction the entire market’s going, which is towards environmentally friendly equipment. So, things that come off the bench aren’t going to be in that category for sure. And I think the cost of getting things off the bench for what’s there is going to be a lot higher than people think, and so I think that’s a barrier to that coming back. A lot of that equipment was consumed in the last cycle as spare parts and all of the rest of that. So, I think we underestimate -- excuse me, I think there’s a lot less of that and its cost is much higher.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup.
Scott Gruber: I want to come back to the shareholder return question. Jeff, you commented on further actions to come down the road, which is great to hear. But just given the inherent volatility in the market, is the next move likely to be a buyback or a variable dividend? And then, we’ve also seen many of your E&P customers commit to returning a certain percentage of cash flow or free cash flow. Is that something Halliburton would consider, especially in the context of a multiyear upcycle?
Lance Loeffler: Sure, Scott. This is Lance. Look, we think about it very similar to sort of the line of question you’re going down. I mean, look, today, I think this is a first step in a long line of other things that we expect to do to really accelerate cash returns to shareholders. It will come in the form of both increasing the dividend over time but doing it responsibly. And with any excess free cash flow that we would like to dedicate, we may reinstitute share repurchases. So, I think it will be a balance. We’ll see what it’s like when it gets there, not big band of a variable dividend today. Feel like we have the right things in place, and our communications to The Street are pretty clear around how we’re managing this business and prioritizing free cash flow. And we’ll be really good stewards about how we send it back to shareholders.
Scott Gruber: Got it. I also want to come back to Dave’s question on e-frac and ask a little bit broader question. We got the CapEx figure for the year, and you’re keeping CapEx below the 6% level. But there’s been this kind of outstanding question for Halliburton. As the frac market recovers, do your CapEx need to surprise and you have to go above that level? So, I guess the real question is, are you happy with the cadence of fleet renewal within the frac fleet? Are you able to kind of keep up your competitiveness with the pace of spend embedded in the budget this year? And just kind of as you think about over the medium term, do you think you can keep up your competitiveness with this -- with the cadence of renewal in the frac fleet that’s built into that 6% -- sub-6% reinvestment level?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Yes, we do, is the answer. We believe we thrive in this type of environment and managing or maintaining CapEx where it is. Look, it’s a 5% to 6% of revenues. In my view, this very much show me story and we expect to deliver returns. And we do things ratably. And strategically, we view North America as maximizing value in North America. That means managing the right level of spend, the right type of technology, the right pacing of equipment. Clearly, the right pricing for equipment and making the right cash flow from that equipment. And so, the target is -- we are very consistent around our strategy, and that strategy is actually quite exciting for us to pursue a strategy that delivers the most free cash flow and grows and improves margin. So, I view this as a margin cycle, not a build cycle. And like I said, our team is excited about pursuing that, delivering on that. And that’s why very comfortable with sort of that balance of the right level of investment, while we invest in D&E and international businesses at the same time. I mean, all of that fits together into how do we deliver and our plan to deliver accelerating free cash flow.
Operator: Next question comes from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.
Connor Lynagh: I wanted to return to the potential shareholder returns. And Lance, I wanted to just clarify a comment that you made in regards to excess free cash flow. I mean, how should we think about what that is? Is there a level of cash balance that you want to maintain in the business? Is there a sort of standard amount of delevering you want to occur over the next few years here? Basically, how would you define that for people?
Lance Loeffler: Yes. Good question. I appreciate the follow-up. I think today, a minimum cash balance for us to run our business is around $2 billion, give or take. And so, we’re always sensitive a little bit to that or mindful of it. But I would say, I’ve been pretty clear about what we want to do in terms of strengthening the balance sheet. We need to be closer to 2 times debt to EBITDA. We spent a lot of time on this call, I know Jeff has, talking about the trajectory of the denominator in that equation. And we have work to do on the numerator. So, we expect to continue to find ways to attack gross debt. And I think starting with retiring the ‘23s and what’s left of the ‘25s post this redemption is a good target.
Connor Lynagh: Got it. Maybe just switching gears a little bit here. Drilling and Evaluation margins, very strong, and it doesn’t seem like you’re expecting that much of a falloff. I appreciate the software accounting dynamics. But you’re still year-over-year looking at something 250 to 300 basis points above where you were in 2021. I guess, two parts to this. Is that a good bogey for how we should think about the rest of the year in Drilling and Evaluation? And just as we think structurally about the return of international and the like, how should we think about the potential profitability cycle-over-cycle? It certainly is trending a lot higher right now. So, I just want to make sure we understand the moving pieces there.
Jeff Miller: Well, it’s a great starting point, and we expect it to trend higher over time as we move through. So, this is the result of technology investment, an excellent drilling business, drilling technology, collaborative approach with our clients, our value proposition; and the other service lines that are in D&E, very strong service lines, drilling fluids, I won’t try to name them all here, but a very strong group of businesses. And I think what you’re seeing in the margin is a demonstration of the improvement in capital velocity that we saw from the new technology in Sperry; also the improved capabilities, whether it’s LWD or the ability to manage the data around that with the 3D inversion. So, there’s a whole series of things that we’ve been working on and actually have many more things left to deliver in that business during 2022. So, our expectations are that we’re starting at a higher point -- or we’re starting the year lower, but we are moving to a higher point. And I think we’ll see that sort of repeat. Great expectations for that business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler.
Ian Macpherson: Just sort of having to squint for concerning issues here as everything is set up pretty well for you here and executing well also. But just curious with escalating tensions in sabre rattling in Ukraine and given that Russia has been a pretty good growth market for the industry. Are you considering any risk with regard to sanctions impacting the trajectory of the business in Russia or Eastern Hemisphere on a knock-on basis at this point, or does this look like things that you’ve seen and done before?
Jeff Miller: Look, these are things we’ve seen and done before. Always unfortunate in so many ways for so many people. But from a business perspective, we’ve managed these sorts of things up and down for, I hate to say, nearly 100 years. So, these are the kinds of things that we would manage through.
Ian Macpherson: Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Lance, just looking at our cash flow calculator for this year. You obviously had some good tailwinds in ‘21 with working capital release, which we know will reverse with cycle growth. And you also had probably better than sort of ratable disposal proceeds. So, when we think about 5% to 6%, you’ll be probably closer to 5% and 6% of gross CapEx this year. How are you thinking about the other pieces? Because I did hear something in the prepared remarks about containing working capital expansion with growth, so maybe not a monster number of working capital expansion this year.
Lance Loeffler: Yes. Look, you’re right. Really happy with the way ‘21 free cash flow performed for us. And I think that we’ve talked about before how we’ve meaningfully, I believe, transformed the free cash flow profile of Halliburton and all the strategic priorities that we’ve sort of discussed are things that help drive us to that end. But you’re right. I think stronger free cash flow starts with stronger margins. And I think what you should expect for 2022 is to see that continued strength, operating cash flow less or excluding working capital to continue to drive higher, obviously. But I think that we’re running into a period of time in 2022 that the amount of growth that we expect in the business is just going to drive an investment in working capital as opposed to a release of cash. But, as I’ve always said, we are looking to put that investment back much more efficiently than when we took it out. And personally, that’s something that I’m committed to and working really hard with the organization to find those benefits.
Operator: And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Shannon. Look, I’ll just conclude that this upcycle is a great setup for Halliburton to achieve profitable growth and accelerated free cash flow generation. Today’s dividend increase and debt retirement announcements provide just two examples of what Halliburton expects to deliver throughout this multiyear upcycle. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Shannon, let’s close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-19 09:00:00) =====

Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller : Thank you David and good morning everyone. Last quarter, we discussed a longer view of a recovering market and our confidence in a multiyear up-cycle. I am pleased with the steady march of activity and Halliburton 's performance in the third quarter internationally and in North America, all reinforce our enthusiasm today, and for what we expect in 2022 and beyond.  Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of both our strategy and our execution as the market recovery accelerates. Here are some highlights. Total Company revenue increased 4% sequentially with top-line improvements across all regions. While adjusted operating income grew 6% with solid margin performance in both divisions. Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 4%, driven by increased global activity. Operating margin was essentially flat in the third quarter, as we made operational choices to prepare for higher demand for our services in 2022. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 4% with increased activity across multiple regions.  Operating margin of 11% was about flat sequentially. North America revenue increased 3% as growth in U.S. land was partially offset by a decline in our Gulf of Mexico business due to Hurricane Ida. International revenue grew 5% sequentially in line with the international rig count growth. Our year-to-date free cash flow generation of almost $900 million puts us solidly on track to deliver our full-year free cash flow objective.  Finally, we retired $500 million of our long-term debt and ended the quarter with 2.6 billion of cash on hand. As this upcycle unfolds in both the International and North America markets, Halliburton is executing on our strategy to deliver profitable growth and generate industry-leading returns.  In the international markets, third quarter activity momentum continued, and I believe it will accelerate into year end and support mid-teen second half revenue growth compared to the second half of last year. This expected outcome is better than we anticipated a quarter ago. In the third quarter, we started long-term projects across all regions in spite of the COVID-19 interruptions.  While mobility restrictions and daily precautions remain in place, business activity around the world has adjusted and continues to improve. In the Middle East, countries relaxed border restrictions and Opec (ph) members prepared for activity increases. We started to work on several rigs offshore UAE, mobilized a work-over project in Bahrain, and completed multiple ESP installations on our Artificial Lift contract in Kuwait. We expect the Middle East to exit the year with solid activity momentum. In Asia-Pacific, we launched operations on an integrated project offshore Malaysia with full implementation of Halliburton's Digital Well construction capabilities. We also ramped up for an increase in our Indonesia drilling operations where the local NOC plans to boost production from its assets. In Europe, Africa, CIS region.  The start of operations on a 23 well offshore integrated development campaign for Woodside in Senegal marked a new country entry for Halliburton. In Russia, we're mobilizing for a multiyear IOC operated project on Sakhalin Island. In the UK sector of the North Sea, work continues on several new development drilling, and workover projects for local independent operators. Finally, Latin America delivered its best quarterly performance since 2015.  We spotted the first well on a three-year integrated project in Brazil, deployed our new drilling technologies on multiple wells in Argentina and prepared to mobilize for new work in Ecuador and Columbia. In addition to contract startups, our pipeline of new tenders continues to grow.  While large Middle East tenders and Latin America projects received most of the headlines, customers in Africa, Russia and Southeast Asia, among others, are also issuing tenders for new work. All of this points to increasing international customer urgency and demand for our services. Let me describe what I'm seeing that gives me this conviction. Global supply and demand balance continues to tighten, resulting in a strong commodity price environment. In response, asset owners are eager to reverse baseline production declines caused by multiple years of under investment.  We expect that NOCs and other operators with short cycle production opportunities will commit additional capital and gain share to meet future oil demand. Additionally, new fields are smaller and more complex. More customers work harder to produce more barrels. Finally, as mature assets change hands, new owners move quickly to revitalize the assets they acquire and unlock remaining reserves.  They require service partners who can deliver proven technology and decades of experience. All of these things have one thing in common. They require higher service intensity, more dollars spent on the wellbore rather than on infrastructure. As the international recovery accelerates, we remain committed to a clear strategic priority. deliver profitable growth, and we have unique competitive advantages to deliver on this priority.  We have the established footprint, geographic presence, and customer and supplier relationships to capitalize on growth. We have a strong presence in all major international markets. The substantial majority of our workforce is local and within the regions where we operate, our supply chain spend is primarily with local suppliers. We have proven capabilities to ramp up our services as customers enter new markets. We demonstrated this in Guyana, Suriname, and most recently, in Senegal.  The Halliburton team mobilized personnel and built a multi-functional operational base to support Woodside as we embark together on a development campaign offshore Senegal. We also engineer innovative solutions, both digital and hardware to meet the complex reservoir challenges faced by our international customers.  For example, in well construction, this quarter we introduced the iStar comprehensive measurement platform. This next-generation intelligent platform provides multiple logging and drilling measurements that enabled reservoir evaluation, faster drilling, and consistent well delivery. For multiple customers in the Middle East and North Sea, the iStar platform provides insight into the impact of drilling parameters on well work conditions, and optimizes the drilling process in real-time. In completions, we're the global leader in downhole completion solutions. As our customers increase their activity, our e-completions ecosystem integrates manufacturing digital twins and technology development processes to increase our speed to market for these long lead complex systems.  In many regions, as customers drive for better performance in the face of increasing operational challenges, I expect adoption of integrated and bundled contracts will continue to grow. Halliburton has strong project management capabilities, and they've proven track record that deliver efficiencies and reduce total customer cost of ownership. Our digital innovations reframe customer project economics through greater efficiencies and improved decision-making.  For example, in the third quarter, we deployed our well construction 4.0 digital solution to deliver further operational efficiencies for our customer in the Middle East. Finally, our customers call on us for collaboration from an IOC, looking to reduce emissions on its operations in Mexico, to a European independent working to remotely monitor and control all of its global drilling operations.  Halliburton 's value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers is working for both our customers and Halliburton. Now, turning to North America, the bifurcation between public and private Company activity continued in the third quarter.  Public E&Ps remain committed to their spending plans for 2021 while private operators continue to take advantage of a strong commodity price environment. As expected, completions growth moderated in the third quarter as operator's shifted their focus from completions to drilling activity. Just like in the international markets, customer urgency and demand for our services keep growing in North America.  Drilled but uncompleted well counts reached the lowest levels since 2013 as operators depleted the surplus of ducks accumulated in 2020, we expect customers to drill and complete more new wells to offset steep base decline rates and deliver production into an anticipated attractive market next year, Completions equipment availability is tightening.  Customers have responded by starting the 2022 tender process earlier in an attempt to lock in access to quality services for next year's programs. Private companies now operate about 60% of the U.S. land rig count. And current commodity prices provide a strong incentive for their activity to expand. Our market-leading position in North America is rooted in the groundbreaking technologies we put to work in this market.  We are the only fully integrated service provider in North America, and this gives us a unique competitive advantage. We combine the full breadth of our technology disciplines, geo -sciences, physics, chemistry, material science, and mechanical, electrical and software engineering to deliver innovative solutions at scale around the world, and uniquely in North America, to maximize production and minimize costs, Our smart fleet intelligent fracturing services transitioned from pilot to campaign mode. Several large operators today have smart fleet working on multi-pad completion programs.  Smart fleet for the first time allows operators to measure treatment placement in real time, which among other things, has demonstrated up to 30% improvement in cluster uniformity. In the third quarter, we introduced the IsoBond Cement System and pumped it for multiple customers in the DJ Basin and in the Marcellus shale. By removing liquid additives, this dry-blended cement provides significant operational efficiencies and lower capital requirements for land operations. Taking advantage of the increasing demand for our services require strategic execution on many fronts, particularly in the current environment of stressed supply chains, tight labor, and inflationary pressures. Against that reality, I believe that Halliburton is best prepared to provide reliable execution for our customers. Our sophisticated supply chain organization translates Halliburton size and scale into real savings for us and our customers.  We are seeing that in action as our supply chain delivers what our customers require for their projects. The labor market is tight today. We've seen the situation before, and our human resources team knows how to navigate it. Over the last few years, we compressed our onboarding time, strengthened our national recruiting network, and used digital solutions to significantly reduce our field personnel requirements. Despite real challenges, we have the scale, speed, and systems to recruit talent nationally and quickly deploy it for our customers. In logistics, we have ready access to a fleet of drivers to make deliveries to the job site. We expanded our collaboration with Vorto, an artificial intelligence supply chain platform. Our early adoption of Vorto's platform that connects drivers, asset owners, and maintenance yards allows us to effectively manage trucking inflation, and availability constraints.  Now let me spend a few minutes on our activity and pricing outlook for 2022, first in the international markets and then in North America. Next year, we expect international activity momentum to accelerate, and international leading edge pricing to move upward in pockets as a result of higher activity. This is what we're seeing today.  Large tenders remain competitive, but we're already seeing modest price increases on discrete work in underserved markets. We see increasing customer demand for Halliburton's high-end technology and the recognition of its value. Finally, as a result of lower spending by service companies for more than half a decade, international market face tightening equipment supply.  To meet these demands, we are strategically reallocating assets to drive, improve utilization and returns. Let me be clear. Halliburton prioritizes profitable growth internationally and this will drive our capital allocation decisions to the best returning product lines, geographies, and contracts.  In North America, we expect customer spending to increase in and around 20% next year, including solid net pricing gains. Many factors drive that spending and pricing, including customer urgency, equipment tightness, handed desire to align with a reliable and differentiated service provider like Halliburton. Last quarter, we highlighted the pricing traction that exists for low emission equipment.  Today, as we tender for 2022 work, we're seeing price increases for the rest of our fracturing fleet as well. Net pricing has also increased across different non - frac product service lines, drilling, cementing, drill bits, and artificial lift. To generate the highest returns as this market grows, we are taking steps to maximize the value of our North America business.  Specifically, we are repositioning our fracturing fleets to customers in areas where we can maximize returns in 2022, securing longer-term, premium pricing contracts for our existing and planned electric fleets, and accelerating fleet maintenance and deployment of the next-generation fluid in technology, which extends the life of our equipment.  Halliburton has committed to North America and I expect we will benefit more than others as activity and pricing momentum accelerates across the board. Next, let me turn to how we are executing on our strategic priority to advance a sustainable energy future. As we are witnessing now and saw in the third quarter, the worlds requires a greater supply of oil and gas. As an oilfield services Company, we have the core competency to help our customers to deliver this supply in the most efficient and technologically advanced ways possible.  With our customers, we are bringing our technical expertise and over a century of industry experience to actively participate in the transition to a cleaner economy. One of the most meaningful contributions we can make today to this transition is to help our customers reduce emissions from their existing production base.  Emissions reduction is a critical part of our technology development process, and our innovative low-carbon solutions are helping oil and gas operators reduce their carbon footprint. Halliburton 's electric fracturing solution delivers results now for our customers. In the third quarter, Halliburton completed an all electric pad operation on a multiyear contract with Chesapeake Energy in the Marcellus shale.  We deployed our electric fracturing spread with electric blending, wireline, and ancillary equipment, and an advanced power-generation system from VoltaGrid. This high-performing solution reduced Chesapeake's emission using over 25 megawatts of lower-carbon power generation from Chesapeake's local field gas. We are collaborating with an IOC in Mexico on their total carbon footprint reduction.  Because we provide both well construction services and logistic services on this contract, we changed supply boat fueling mechanisms and optimized usage to achieve emissions reductions in the first year of operations. We are now using a similar contract structure to collaborate with this IOC on its other projects in Latin America.  We're also advancing renewable energy solutions through Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. In the third quarter, we doubled our size by increasing the number of Halliburton Labs companies from 4 to 8. Welcoming Alumina Energy from California, Ionada from Ontario, and Parasanti and SurgePower Materials from Texas. We help these companies scale their exciting technologies, from innovative energy storage solutions to modular carbon capture systems. In September, Halliburton Labs hosted its third finalist pitch day, featuring 9 early-stage companies, and an audience of several hundred entrepreneurs, investors, academics, and other professionals, looking to engage with companies that advance cleaner, affordable energy.  The Halliburton Labs participants are achieving results, and Roxol Bioenergy completed a $10 million series 8 round of financing, and Roxol 's patented modular system uses locally sourced organic or plastic waste to generate clean on-site energy, even in the most remote and inaccessible location.  Other accelerator participants achieved important scaling milestones in the third quarter. With both current and expected demand increases, Halliburton remains committed to the priorities we set in 2020. We prioritize profitable growth and returns, remain focused on capital efficiency at are keeping our overall capital investment in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue.  I'm excited about the multiyear up-cycle we see in front of us. I believe our value proposition, technology differentiation, digital adoption, and capital efficiency will allow us to deliver profitable growth internationally and maximize value in North America. Halliburton will continue to execute our key strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to Lance (ph) to provide more details on our third quarter financial results (ph). Lance.
Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2021. Total Company revenue for the quarter was $3.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $458 million, an increase of 4% and 6% respectively.  During the third quarter, Halliburton closed the structured transaction for our North America real estate assets that I described earlier this year, which resulted in a $74 million gain. We also discontinued the proposed sale of our pipeline and process services business, leading to a depreciation catch-up related to these assets previously classified as assets held for sale. As a result, among these and other items, we recognize a $12 million pretax charge. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our division results in more detail. Starting with our completion in production division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 4% while operating income was $322 million or an increase of 2%. These results were driven by increased activity across multiple product service lines in the western hemisphere, higher cementing activity in the Middle East Asia region, as well as increased well intervention services in the Europe, Africa, CIS region.  These improvements were partially offset by reduced completion tool sales in the eastern hemisphere, lower stimulation activity in the Middle East / Asia region, and accelerated maintenance expenses for our stimulation business in North America, which related to upgrading our fluid and technology in preparation for the anticipated market acceleration that Jeff described earlier.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.7 billion, or an increase of 4%, while operating income was $186 million, or an increase of 6%. These results were due to improved drilling-related services internationally and in North America land, additional testing services and wireline activity across Latin America, along with increased project management activity in Mexico and Ecuador. Partially off-setting these increases were reduced drilling-related services in Norway and the Gulf of Mexico.  Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 3%. This increase was driven primarily by higher well construction, artificial lift, and wireline activity in North America land, increased completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, and additional stimulation and drilling activity in Canada.  Partially offsetting these increases were reduced drilling-related, wireline, and stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the impact from Hurricane Ida. Turning to Latin America, revenue increased 17% sequentially. This improvement was driven by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil, as well as higher well construction services in Columbia, and improved project management activity in Ecuador. These increases were partially offset by reduced fluid services in the Caribbean. In Europe, Africa, CIS, revenue was essentially flat sequentially. These results were driven by higher well intervention services across the region, increased well construction services and completion tool sales in Nigeria, additional pipeline and fluid services in Russia, and increased activity across multiple product service lines in Senegal.  These improvements were offset by decreased activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea and Algeria and lower completion tool sales in Angola. In the Middle East Asia region, revenue increased 2% resulting from improved well construction activity in the Middle East and Australia.  These improvements were partially offset by lower completion tool sales across the region, along with reduced wireline and stimulation activity in Saudi Arabia, lower projects. Management activity in India, and lower stimulation activity in Malaysia. In the Third Quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $50 million For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to moderately increase.  Net interest expense for the quarter was a $116 million. In the third quarter, we retired $500 million of 2021 senior notes using cash on hand, as a result, our net interest expense in the fourth quarter should decline modestly. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 24%. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 22%.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately a $190 million. In response to higher demand for our services in both international and North America markets, we are pulling forward spending on long lead time items for our premium equipment, and now expect our full-year capital expenditures to be closer to $800 million for the full year.  Turning to cash flow, we generated approximately $620 million of cash from operations and almost $470 million of free cash flow during the third quarter. I am very pleased with our working capital performance this quarter as we delivered net cash proceeds from working capital despite our revenue growth.  Now let me describe our near-term outlook. In North America, we expect moderate pricing and activity improvements in drilling and completions to drive sequential growth. In the international markets, we expect continued improvement in rig counts, the pace of which will vary across regions. As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate mid single-digit revenue growth sequentially, with operating margins expected to expand by approximately 50 basis points.  The higher year-end completion tool sales will be partially offset by seasonal North America land activity impacted by the holidays and lower efficiency levels typically experienced in the winter months. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue growth of 5% to 7%, and a margin increase of a 150 to 200 basis points, due to seasonal software sales and higher overall global activity. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff.
Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. To summarize our discussion today. Halliburton is on track to deliver strong results and our financial commitments for this year. We see customer urgency and demand for our services increasing internationally and in North America. We expect to benefit from the accelerating recovery and deliver profitable growth in the international markets and maximize value in North America.  We prioritize our investments to the highest returns opportunities and are committed to capital efficiency. As our forward outlook unfolds, we expect to deliver strong free cash flow and industry leading returns for our shareholders. And now, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
James West : Hey. Good morning, guys.
Jeff Miller : Morning, James
Lance Loeffler : Morning, James.
James West : Just -- clearly, a very bullish global outlook of North America and International. It seems though that International really stepped up even further than you thought, maybe initially in the last 3 months since the last conference call. Could you perhaps describe where the -- these pleasant surprises are coming from?
Jeff Miller : Well, thanks, James. Look, I think broadly if I look out at the improvements, it's really a function of the tightening macro, and what we see and so. I think supply is clearly short. I mean, this underspending that's been happening for really 7 years is starting to have an effect on the supply side, and that drives clearly urgency, but it's harder to do.  And then along with that, we've got short supply service assets, and that is also driving great environment for us and Halliburton's in the right places. And so when I think about profitable growth internationally and also maximizing value in North America, that's right in the fairway of where we want to be.  And so this beginning of an up-cycle, I think what we'll see are our operators work very hard to improve production, but it's short-cycle style barrels are just going to take a lot more work around the wellbore. And all very good. And it's really, as I said, beginning of what I see as a very strong up-cycle for our services.
James West : Sure. No doubt about that and we certainly agree. One follow-up from me, North America, the 20% number that you put out there, which is actually the same number that we're using, but how much of that increase is activity versus pricing in the inflationary environment that we're now seeing in North America? Meaning, is activity in that scenario up 10%, 12%, is up 15%. How are you thinking about activity levels versus the overall spend level?
Jeff Miller : Look, I think -- clearly it's a combination of both. I think that we will see certainly inflation, I'm not going to give you a number today, but I think that we're seeing strengthening pricing -- strengthening pricing into 2022 so I think that'll be a part of it. In fact to our strategy of maximizing value in North America, I think that we're going to be really sharp around where we work and how we generate those returns.  So I -- is it -- I would -- I think that pricing will move up more. And I think there will be a lot of effort put into the activity but the combination of equipment shortages that drive prices are going to probably be a headwind to a degree on activity as we get into the year, biased more to price than activity probably.
James West : Okay. Got it. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Neil Mehta : Good morning team. I want to go back to the comments last quarter, the 400 basis points of margin improvement by 2023. Given we're in a firmer oil macro environment and the activity pick-up that you anticipate. Do you see potential for that actually get pulled forward. And how are we tracking relative to the 400 basis points of their upside or downside, as you tested out real-time.
Jeff Miller : So thanks, Neil. But look, I'm really excited about the outlook and the possibility to pull that forward. Certainly, that's a possibility. I think that we're on track. I mean, everything that I see indicates that's well on our viewfinder in terms of getting to the '23 outlook that I had.  The pace at which oil -- oil demand comes back, which I would say is surprising a little bit to the upside in spite of what's out there with respect to COVID, certainly encouraging, certainly highlights what we've been seeing for some time, which is how important oil is, and more importantly, the impact that not spending normal rates for quite a long time has on the supply of oil. Of course, operators are going to work really hard to accelerate that, which is fantastic for Halliburton. So I'm very encouraged about the outlook and the Pacing.
Neil Mehta : Alright Jeff. And then the follow-up is just return of capital, that $500 million of debt this quarter next year is set up to be a good free cash flow year, how do you think about getting the dividend or capital returns profile to be more competitive relative to the rest of energy
Lance Loeffler : Yes, Neil, this is Lance. Look, we certainly -- no doubt, we see an environment that provides us with a lot more flexibility as we look towards 2022. And I would just say this year, 2021, we've had a strategy and we're continuing to execute that. It starts with EBITDA growth, Capex control, and a focus on deleveraging throughout the course of the year. The dividend raise is certainly in the viewfinder as our outlook plays out.  We're still going to continue to be focusing on deleveraging our business and to a certain extent accelerating it when it makes economic sense. So there's still work to do there, but I think the message is that we've got a great opportunity to address all of these things as we move into next year.
Neil Mehta : Thanks, Lance.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.
David Anderson : Hi. Good morning, Jeff. So the question on everyone's mind right now is net pricing in the U.S. and whether or not you're getting that now. I was wondering if you could just confirm you have in fact recently put through a pricing increase in U.S. pumping business. And addition, if you could address the topic of labor inflation and how much is that offsetting pricing and what could that mean if the industry looks to add, say, 20 or so fleets on the coming quarters. Our E&P seem to think pricing is going to stay flat outside of inflation, so I'm just kind of curious where you think that disconnect could be.
Jeff Miller : I think the disconnect will be around supply of equipment and also the type of equipment, there's a lot of demand out there. I'll talk about pricing may be first. We're seeing it now, it looks a little different than maybe in prior cycles in the sense that it's more of a process than it is a point in time, but yes, making a lot of progress around that.  We've talked about premium equipment and clearly that's -- a lot of demand for that and it's in short supply and likely stays that way. And so that's certainly positive. Our outlook is that we're going to, certainly, getting that pricing -- getting some net pricing now, and we expect to continue that, particularly as equipment tightens. It starts with the premium equipment, but my view is that we will see that across the entire fleet as we go into 2022.  And so with respect to inflation, yes, seeing that, I think that's been passed along fairly straightforward manner, but that's not the pricing that actually we're looking forward to and seeing some of now. From a labor perspective and, if you described 20 more fleets into 2022, your 40 to 85% utilization today, that takes us what, like close to 100. That drives a lot of pricing activity around equipment, and the labor, I think, it will exacerbate that.  We were very fortunate at Halliburton that we're able to manage the labor, other elements of transportation, I think, more effectively than the market. I described some of that in my comments. But I think that will continue to get tight and I like the way we're differentially positioned around those things also.
David Anderson : Clearly, labor is an issue everywhere and I'd have to think of the oil field especially acutely. A separate question. You touched on this a little bit, but I'm really wondering what the inventory of kind of both directional drilling and completion tools globally. Now, you're spending only about 5% of revenue on Capex.  It's less than half the rate of just a few years ago. Your competitors have also been very capital disciplined. Obviously, not just the E&Ps were capital disciplined, but you guys have been as well. But now on this cost of this global recovery in activity, as you said, multi your up-cycle unfolding.  And we're also seeing the supply chain issues across the industry. I guess my question is, if there's going to be the shortage of type of specialized equipment next year and where do you see it most acute? You talked about reallocating equipment, but I feel like we've done this already a couple of times, and I know you've been moving it around, but it feels like we're kind of coming into this inflection on a lot of this equipment out there, and I'm just kind of curious of your views on that.
Jeff Miller : Well, we likely are and we are -- it's getting tight, it's tighter, and we're going to reallocate equipment to the highest return opportunities. And I think we're just going to see some tightness, which is a healthy thing, which is going to drive better asset allocation to projects. We're -- we see capital velocity as a strategic plank for us that we're very focused on and we think that's the key to driving profitable growth.  And I say it that way because there will be many opportunities, our focus is on the profitable slice of that. And things that we're seeing set up as it gets more active internationally. Short-cycle barrels clearly will use equipment, but as we see, some element of offshore activity creep into that, that soaks up more capacity.  And so I expect we'll see quite a bit of tightness which is very, very positive for Halliburton and our outlook. I mean, I don't -- I think that the returns haven't been there, and we expect to see solid returns, and growth in returns, and free cash flow, and a tight market is what makes that happen.
David Anderson : Looking forward to them. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Chase Mulvehill : Good morning, everyone. So I just wanted to --
Jeff Miller : Good morning Chase.
Chase Mulvehill : Good morning. I just want to follow up on the commentary around the North America Capex being up 20%, obviously U.S. onshore will be up a little bit more. But I just want to connect the dots there and just try to understand how you're getting to the 20%. Because if you just look at operating cash flow of E and Ps, those could be up 30 to 40% year-over-year. So that would imply that they would spend less of operating cash flow [Indiscernible] today, they're spending about 50% of operating cash flow.  And if you just look at consensus for public E&Ps, we're talking high teens already for growth. So that implies a more modest pace of growth for the private E&P s. So I just I want to kind of understand the 20% [Indiscernible] that you put out there for North America.
Jeff Miller : Thanks, Chase. Look, 20% is a good starting point. Obviously, could it be more? It could be certainly and I think the more activity there is, the more price there will be and so kind of take those in tandem. When we look at 2022, clearly there's a call on U.S. production at the kind of commodity prices that we see today, and particularly given the supply shortage.  So we have always expected that we would see North America move first and strongest as we got into the real heavy lift around short supply. That said though, I do believe that it is moderated to a degree because there are formulas in place around how reinvestment -- around reinvestment rates, around dividend requirements, around compensation schemes.  So all of that's in place which serves to certainly moderate activity for the public. And I suspect we'll -- those budgets aren't out, but I certainly expect that we'll see those. The privates clearly are very active. An evidence to me that we see sort of that strengthening, is we're finding more work.  The reality is -- was we readjust pricing and look at the market that requires moving around to different operators at different times. And we're doing some of that now. But the old adage, you don't quit a job till you have a job. And we're finding jobs. All of that is positive, but I think that there will be tightness around equipment in that environment. I don't -- we're in and around 20 is just sort of a current outlook on 22. I don't mean that to be prescriptive. Could it be more clearly, it could be more. But I also think it will be very tight.
Chase Mulvehill : Thanks. Great. Can I follow-up on the frac maintenance expense. I mean, you noted -- in the press release you talked about it during the earnings call. I don't know if you would offer up how material it was, is it -- does it recur again in 4Q and so maybe that's impacting margins on the CMP side a little bit.  And also maybe, is -- should we think about this is as an indication that you think you're going to be able to get the pricing you need in 2022 to really kind of drive more activity on the frac side.
Jeff Miller : Yeah. Look at the -- the maintenance was maybe a penny. But clarity around where that equipment will go. I mean, that's an indicator that we have certainty around where that equipment will go to work and the kind of things we're doing are like the, the [Indiscernible] end are things that drive better margins for us and a longer life over the life of that so it's just wise to do, I think more important is that we've got real clarity around where that equipment goes and 22 and we want to make certain that we're ready and it goes to work at prices that clearly eclipse any cost of maintenance on the equipment.  It's just the thing that we want to do. Q4, we've given you our guidance and all that's in that guidance. So look, I take it as a real positive that we've got the clarity that we have, and just the concrete evidence of where this equipment will go. And we just want to make certain that we're taking care of everything in real-time.
Chase Mulvehill : Right. Perfect. I'll turn it back over. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Scott Gruber : Guys, good morning.
Jeff Miller : Hey, Scott.
Lance Loeffler : Morning, Scott.
Scott Gruber : I just want to come back to the domestic inflation question again. Are there any numbers you could put on the delta in your inflation versus the market inflation just given your advantages. And now that you're securing, what I assume is market-based price increases, kind of what that combination could be.  The framework is -- if the market pricing is up 15%, but peers are seeing like 10% inflation only getting net 5. But -- there is a meaningful gap for Halliburton, maybe you're net inflation or your net pricing gains are 10% because you aren't experiencing half of the inflation.  So if you could tell us what that inflation gap could be and obviously I just made those figures up, so [Indiscernible] any color on the potential net pricing gains for Halliburton vis -a - vis the competition would be great.
Jeff Miller : Yeah. Look, guys, it's very competitive information. I'd say we out perform ed the numbers you laid out. But maybe I'll just walk through the components of how we manage these things. It's very -- we have very sophisticated supply chain organization and they are working overtime, but absolutely getting it done.  Price fairly passed on to customers. The labor [Indiscernible] the ability to recruit nationally in the US, and the ability to have a strong local workforce internationally, both are key elements of managing inflation for Halliburton. From our raw materials perspective. Again, supply chain buys from the entire world, we manage logistics, and we actually see that improving in terms of tightness as we go into 2022.  Particularly we're seeing sort of space on airplanes. As the world opens up and we see more carriers sort of get back to work, we actually believe the international logistics around raw material gets better. And then in North America, our relationship with Vorto is having quite an impact. I mean, we are able to add drivers. We were able to retain drivers, it's been quite disruptive but very effective.  And so look, I'm confident that we outperform in terms of managing inflation for Halliburton, but that's a separate topic from where we see pricing going in 2022 and many cases now.
Scott Gruber : Just a quick one on international Jeff, you mentioned an acceleration in international activity next year. Any early read on where that figure could go. Are you thinking potentially mid [Indiscernible], high - [Indiscernible]. We've seen 20% growth in past years during strong up cycles. Just any early read on where international activity growth could ascend to next year?
Jeff Miller : Yeah. Look, the entire international market is a huge market, and so to move all of that at a high rate is probably more difficult to do, particularly given where the supply chain actually in project backlog is for clients. But nevertheless, could it be low-teens to mid-teens? Yeah, certainly could be. Super excited about Latin America and the pace of growth and the outlook there. Middle East should be very strong.  And I think we're going to see the kind of broad-based improvement that allows pricing and pockets of places to continue to get better. So it's going to be good. It should be really, really good market internationally. I think we build into it throughout 22 as well.
Scott Gruber : Got it. Thank you.
Jeff Miller : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Arun Jayaram: Good morning. I wanted to get a bit more color on some of the implications of house decision to reposition some of your frac fleets to get the better pricing you mentioned and exposure to long-term contracts. So I wanted to maybe get a sense of are you mobilizing that equipment today. So, is that going to be a little bit of a drag on 4Q, and as you get that equipment into those newer markets, does that give you some tailwinds as we think about 2022.
Jeff Miller : Yeah. I think it does give us tailwinds as we go into 2022. Drag our headwinds near-term. Not much -- any of that would be in our guidance. But look, this is making -- maximizing the value in North America, which is clearly what strategically we want to do and plan to do. And our doing involves making decisions around what we do with the assets that we have. And I think you're seeing that and will continue to see that from Halliburton.  And so I'm super encouraged, and a lot of the discussions we're having today with customers are around 2022, in fact, most of that dialogue is 2022 and beyond, actually, even into some sort of 23 type discussion. So I'm super encouraged, so what we want to make sure is that our assets are deployed where they're the most valuable for us and our clients. And yes, that does include moving them around.  When we're moving them around, we tend to do more maintenance on them and what not. That's the opportunity that we take typically to do high-grades of fluid ends and that kind of thing. And so it should be interpreted in a very positive way what we're doing, and particularly a demonstration of really two strategic planks. One is maximizing value in North America and the second is capital velocity. Capital efficiency.
Arun Jayaram: Got it. Got it. Any color, Jeff, on which basins that you sense is a better opportunity to get better pricing in these long-term commitments?
Jeff Miller : Well, fortunately, we're in all the basins. And so I don't really take a view of basin by basin as much as we do customer opportunity by customer opportunity, and that can be wherever it might fall. I'm not going to necessarily carve out a particular location. Clearly, there's more activity nearly in all of the basins today, and so that's very encouraging.
Arun Jayaram: Okay. My follow-up is just on international -- there's 3.5 to 4 million barrels offline by OpEx Plus. I wanted to get your views on -- are you seeing any shifts internationally from customers, perhaps shifting from a focus on maintenance Capex, sustaining Capex projects, to growing productive capacity. and if so, which markets are you seeing perhaps some shift towards that -- into a bit more growth?
Jeff Miller : Look, I think [Indiscernible] we're going to find internationally, there's been a lot of under spend for quite a long time and a lot of countries are declining today. Declining is hard to overcome. They'll work hard to do that, but that doesn't necessarily move the needle in terms of production. It might get it back to flat instead of even with extra work, it takes extra work to just stem the decline.  All of that's positive for us. I mean, clearly we see more activity as we go into 2022 in the Middle East and Latin America. But again, I think that those that can spend and are in a position to do so will, but there's the capital austerity by a number of clients is still well in place, and so I think that -- and I say that in the sense that I think that production is going to all be near wellbore, which is very good for us, and I think that a lot of work will get done. But I still see supply as tight for really quite some time.  I mean, it doesn't turn back on. Maybe a point worth remembering, in 2014, the number of big multi-billion-dollar projects with 30-year payouts that were being completed or in the process of finishing, we don't see those today. And the reality is that means there's less spin on infrastructure and a lot more spin on what we do. And I think that's all very, very positive.
Arun Jayaram: Thanks a lot.
Jeff Miller : Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Ian Macpherson : Good morning.
Jeff Miller : Good morning, Ian.
Ian Macpherson : Jeff, it seems like an unsung hero of your year so far has been Latin America. It's whe -- That's where you've had really outsized growth and the market there, the total activity has grown, but it looks like you punched above your weight in Latin America.  Can you speak to those strengths? And you said, I think it's -- not towards in your mouth, but synchronized global, international growth going into next year. For Latin America, in particular, do you expect to see continued momentum on par with the rest of Eastern Hemisphere growth into next year as well?
Jeff Miller : Yes, I do. Look, I'm very encouraged about Latin America. And that team has punched above its weight in Latin America. We've got an excellent team, great position. We're in every country. The technology introduction has been effective there which I've talked about sort of our Drilling Tools and what we've been able to accomplish.  Our project management capabilities are very strong in Latin America and it's allowed us to outperform in my view. I think that continues into 2022 as more work comes on. And again, that's a part of the world where oil production, and it's very important to economies and operators. and I think that we'll continue to see a strong Latin American business.
Ian Macpherson : Great. Thanks, Jeff. And then I was going to ask a follow-up to Lance after. You had a really good quarter here with free cash, with the disposals, and some working capital as well. Any indicators for Q4 [Indiscernible] with regards to extras outside of the basics of free cash with respect to net disposals and working capital movements to close the year.
Lance Loeffler : Yeah, I think we certainly expect continued strength in the operational profit piece of the equation. That's pretty obvious based on our guidance for the quarter. Some of that will be offset by some of that acceleration in Capex spend that we talked about in my prepared remarks.
Jeff Miller : We'll be looking to round out the year around Capex. And look, I think we'll have to see how working capital continues to play out. We have clearly been very focused on working capital and the required investment it would take to put back that investment as we continue to grow, a great outcome this quarter where we actually still generated cash from working capital, despite the fact that our revenue was growing globally.  So all good facts historically, whether we can keep -- whether it's realistic that we can keep that momentum from a working capital perspective going forward might be a little bit harder. So those are all the things that we think about. I mean, look, overall, I'm excited about the way that free cash flow has behaved so far this year and I continue to be encouraged about what that means for next year as well.
Ian Macpherson : Great. Thank you, Jeff.
Jeff Miller : You bet. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Marci Bianci with Cowen (ph). Your line is open.
Marci Bianci: Thank you. I guess, with regard to CMP in North America here, you've got these little bit of maintenance overhang, I guess it's about 50 basis points based on your comment, Jeff, and then there's these pricing initiatives. Is there any way you could give us a sense of the margin leverage that you could see in 2022 from all of this?  I don't know if it'd be perhaps unreasonable to get to 19& or 20% margins towards the end of the year in CMP, if you're willing to comment on that or any other color about how you would see the margin average shaping up.
Jeff Miller : Look, I feel good about our business in 2022, most certainly for the reasons I've described. I'm not going to try to give an outlook today on 2022, but what I can say from an operating -- from an earnings power standpoint. We've been very effective at maintaining the earnings power reset that really happened a year ago, but that's well in place.  And all of the things, there were a lot of things that we did when we were reducing costs a year ago that really they were going to be savings as we saw activity pick up, but they were sort of the things that improved margins with activity. We didn't have much activity, so we didn't see the benefit of that, but a lot of the digital work that we've done in North America and reduction of roofline and changing of maintenance and all of those things become more valuable as we get into an environment where we see more activity.  And so we're really encouraged about the outlook. And not only activity but our technology offering, particularly around frac in North America, is very unique and I think we will see the power of that also.
Marci Bianci: Yeah. Okay, great. And then, Lance, going back to free cash flow, it looks like you're going to be approaching maybe 50% conversion of EBITDA here in '21. Maybe walk us through the puts and takes as you look at '22 Capex, probably in that 5% to 6% range, but just any other color you could talk to around the conversion, that would be great.
Lance Loeffler : Yes. So, I think as we look to '22, it's certainly healthier, right? Generally speaking, I describe it that way because it means that our operational profit contribution is clearly moving higher as -- into the year -- into next year. But like I said earlier, even as I was relating to the fourth quarter, our revenue increase is going to require incremental working capital. Look, 21 is proof that we're focused on it, and managing it as tight as we can and as efficiently as we can. And then you're right, Mark, from a Capex perspective. I think we've been pretty clear what the guardrails are on our business even into next year, 5% to 6% of revenue. But look, at the end of the day, maximizing value in North America, growing international profitably, and that keeping real tremendous amount of focus on capital efficiency. I think all leads to free cash flow growth next year.
Marci Bianci: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back to A - Jeff Miller for closing comments.
Jeff Miller : Thank you, Katherine. Look, I'm pleased with the quarter and look forward to speaking with you again at the end of the next quarter as we see this multiyear up-cycle continue to unfold. Katherine, you can close out the call.
Operator: This concludes today's Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Halliburton's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I’d now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Abu Zeya: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2021 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days.  Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO, and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter earnings release and can also be found in the Quarterly Results and Presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. Our performance in the second quarter demonstrates that our clear strategy is working well and Halliburton strategic priorities are driving value. Let's get right to the highlights. Total company revenue increased 7% sequentially as both North America and international top line continued to improve. Operating income grew 17% with solid margin performance in both divisions.  Our Completion and Production division revenue increased 10%, driven by the strength in U.S. land completions. C&P delivered operating margin of 16% in the second quarter, reaching three-year highs.  Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue grew 5%. Operating margin of 11% was about flat sequentially with rig count increases across multiple regions, offsetting a seasonal decline in software sales.  North America revenue grew 12% as both drilling and completions activity marched higher throughout the quarter. Increased utilization and our significant operating leverage supported sequential margin expansion.  International revenue grew 4% sequentially, with activity increasing in the key producing regions of the world despite COVID-19 disruptions in various countries.  Finally, we generated strong free cash flow this quarter, bringing the year-to-date free cash flow to almost $425 million.  I'm pleased with the solid performance we delivered in the first half of this transition year. While recent market volatility only demonstrates the fact that we remain in a transition year, today, I want to spend more time discussing what I believe will unfold over the next couple of years.  First, let me reaffirm the outlook for the rest of this year. In the second half of 2021, we expect activity momentum to continue. Internationally, we still anticipate a double-digit increase in activity compared to the second half of 2020 even as certain countries continue to face COVID disruptions.  With commodity prices remaining supportive, we believe activity in North America inches higher with drilling outpacing completions as operators build up well inventory for 2022.  Looking beyond this year, let me describe the longer-term outlook. We believe that we're in the early innings of a multi-year upcycle. For the first time in seven years, we anticipate simultaneous growth in international and North America markets, and this view guides our business objectives and expected outcomes.  So, here's how we see the macro industry environment playing out over the next couple of years. First, we believe commodity prices will remain structurally supportive. With both demand resurgence in many economies and increased vaccines availability, we anticipate the global demand will continue to exceed supply, particularly to the extent OPEC+ manages supply additions over the near-term. As OPEC+'s spare capacity returns to normalized levels over the next year, we believe sufficient pent-up global oil demand will support a call on both international and U.S. production.  Second, multiple years of underinvestment in the international markets, coupled with the anticipated oil and gas demand growth, give us confidence in a healthy international recovery. I believe the growth will be led by the national oil companies and focused on shorter cycle barrels. This activity should come with higher service intensity and higher relative capital spend around the wellbore as opposed to long cycle infrastructure investments.  We expect mature fields, both onshore and offshore, to attract the most investment, while large scale greenfield exploration will be limited to a few markets in Africa and Latin America. As a result, we anticipate double-digit annual international spending growth at least over the next couple of years.  Third, we believe that a supportive commodity price environment, normalized levels of spare OPEC+ capacity and high decline rates in U.S. shale are constructive for North American spending. We expect drilling and completion spending in North America will also grow double digits annually over the next two years, although activity will not return to pre-pandemic levels. We expect private operators to opportunistically lead the activity comeback, while public E&Ps balance growth and returns. Fourth, I believe equipment availability will tighten much faster than most people think. In multiple product lines, we believe that equipment supply will fall behind anticipated demand. Today, both drilling and completions equipment are nearing tightness in North America, and we expect to see international markets tighten over the next few quarters.  Given the scarcity of external capital sources, many North American service companies do not currently generate sufficient cash to organically fund investment in new equipment, innovation and maintenance, let alone generate sufficient returns. Internationally, multiple years of service company CapEx reductions should limit equipment availability.  We expect increasing demand and tightening equipment capacity will lead to higher prices. Pricing is beginning to return in North America now and is expected to lag internationally where contract durations are longer.  I know the positive macro outlook I just described as a case for the rising tide lifting all boats. However, what matters is how Halliburton is positioned to outperform in this market. The improving macro environment marks the first time in a long time that we see an increasing level of customer urgency and a pivot back to what creates value in our industry. And this reinforces the power of Halliburton's unique value proposition. Throughout the downturn, Halliburton doubled down on our value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. We continue to invest in technology, both digital and hardware, that maximizes value per barrel of production. We are expanding in new market segments. We are uniquely positioned in North America as the only integrated service company. Our collaborative culture and engineered solutions create sustainable competitive advantage, setting Halliburton up to move from value creation to value capture.  Here are a few examples of how Halliburton creates and captures value through our digital technologies. We're accelerating the deployment and integration of digital, both with our customers and internally. It creates technical differentiation, contributes to higher margins, and drives internal efficiencies.  Over the first six months of this year, we grew the total user count on our iEnergy public cloud by 70%, and cloud revenue now constitutes almost 20% of our overall software revenues. We believe that this shift from on-prem to cloud software solutions drives faster growth. It also allows us to expand our revenue base with the same customers as we add new cloud native applications and increase the number of users within the same operator.  Digital technology enables high value remote and autonomous operations. We see steady growth of our remote monitoring of open hole wireline operations. For example, this past quarter, we deployed virtual remote logging capabilities on a remote location in Continental Europe, utilizing a wellsite specialist in Norway to remotely operate downhole tools. Virtual remote logging allows us to place highly specialized personnel at regional hubs rather than in the field, which leads to better resource utilization, fewer personnel at the well site, less HSE exposure and higher margins. We also deployed digital and automation in our drilling operations across the globe, both on discrete and integrated contracts. Over 75% of our iCruise drilling system runs are fully automated today, and we expect all runs to have some automation by the end of this year. Across Europe and Eurasia, we increased the number of automated jobs fivefold since the beginning of this year. Drilling automation directly translates to top tier customer performance.  For example, over the last two years, it allowed us to improve the rates of penetration by approximately 25% on a Middle East lump sum turnkey project and on another integrated contract in the North Sea.  Moreover, digitalization and automation improved the resource efficiency of our own operations. In the second quarter, on an NOC project in Russia, we reduced rig site personnel by 40%. Separately, for an IOC in the Caspian, we captured cost efficiencies through using a remote operation center to monitor and control drilling jobs. Halliburton's differentiated drilling technologies penetrate the market and deliver results for our customers. Our multi-year investment in drilling technologies is paying off and we believe we are on the right path to outgrow the market as international drilling activity ramps up. Our drilling technologies deliver top quartile performance on discrete contracts and formed the core of our integrated project management offering.  This past quarter, on a challenging gas project on Russia's Yamal Peninsula, the Halliburton project management team drilled eight horizontal wells 36 days ahead of plan with zero HSE incidents. In close collaboration with our customer, we maximized drilling performance and accelerated the operator's production.  And lastly, we deployed digital solutions to optimize production. In the second quarter, we won a contract that highlights the enormous opportunity for digital adoption in the Middle East. After many years of collaboration with Halliburton on its digital transformation journey, Kuwait Oil Company expanded our automated production management contract in North Kuwait to all other assets in the country. KOC will use DecisionSpace 365, Halliburton's cloud-based subscription service for E&P applications to automate work processes and accurately plan, forecast and optimize production throughout KOC's portfolio. We're also expanding in new market segments. We expect to benefit from the significant growth potential of our specialty chemicals and artificial lift businesses, both in North America and internationally. As Halliburton increases participation in these new segments, we believe we will enjoy unique growth opportunities that are margin accretive and longer cycle.  I'm pleased to announce that, in the second quarter, Halliburton was awarded a seven-year production chemicals contract with a large IOC in Oman. Products for this new contract will be manufactured at Halliburton's new Saudi chemical reaction plant scheduled to open later this year. The strategic location of this plant will allow us to manufacture and sell specialty chemicals to other new customers throughout the region.  In North America, we recently expanded our footprint in the downstream process and water treatment chemicals business through awards of two separate five-year specialty chemicals contracts for large refiners on the Gulf Coast.  In our growing international artificial lift business, earlier this month, we completed the first installation of our ESP contract in Kuwait. We believe this contract gives us scale in the region that will allow us to profitably grow our artificial lift business in other key markets.  Finally, Halliburton has the broadest market exposure because we remain the only integrated service provider active in both North America and international markets. I believe this unique position allows us to capitalize on the double-digit growth, equipment tightness, and resulting better service pricing in both markets.  In the international markets, we expect that Halliburton's differentiated drilling equipment capacity tightens first. Over the next few quarters, as large tenders soak up capacity, I expect a return to the pre-pandemic environment when pricing improved in certain markets.  In North America, specific equipment categories are already tight today. There is a high demand for low emissions frac equipment and the supply is limited. Halliburton leads the market in low emission solutions today and that gives us a structural pricing advantage to further maximize value in North America.  Halliburton showcased our market-leading low emission solutions at a recent event in Duncan, Oklahoma. Over the course of five days, several hundred people from more than 40 operators came to see our electric and dual fuel equipment displays and operational demonstrations, including our 5,000 horsepower Zeus electric pumping unit, our new ExpressBlend blending system, eWinch electric wireline unit, the electric tech command center and an effective power generation solution. They didn't just see R&D plans and prototypes. Instead, they witnessed functional, job-ready equipment that works for our customers today and delivers unprecedented fracturing performance and reduced emissions. The Duncan event also showcased our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system. SmartFleet marries our digital capabilities and fracturing expertise to do what was not possible until now – give customers control over fracturing performance in real time. It sets us apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market and solidifies our industry leadership and intelligent fracturing. In the second quarter, we deployed it with two IOC customers in two different US basins with excellent results. Operators achieved more consistent fracturing placement on every stage with improved cluster uniformity and management of offset frac hits.  SmartFleet, paired with our premium low emissions equipment, creates a powerful combination of Halliburton's leading technologies to deliver superior production results, reduced environmental impact, and drive a strong margin differential for Halliburton.  We believe that our unique value proposition, combined with customer urgency and equipment tightness in the US and international markets, will improve pricing for our differentiated equipment and services. As our equipment reaches sustained levels of higher utilization in North America, we are now moving from passing on inflationary cost increases to setting net pricing higher, and we expect this trend to accelerate into 2022.  Internationally, pricing will take longer to catch up to North America and will first manifest itself on discrete contracts in underserved markets. We expect large tenders to remain competitive, but our strategic priority is clear – deliver profitable growth as the recovery unfolds. We expect improved pricing, higher utilization, and our significant operating leverage will deliver strong incrementals for Halliburton in this upcycle.  In the face of both current and expected demand increases, we remain focused on improved returns and capital efficiency and expect our overall capital investment to stay in the range of 5% to 6% of revenue.  Now, let's step back for a minute and think about what this means for Halliburton. My remarks often focus on the practical view of the near term. But I also have conviction about Halliburton's performance in the early innings of this upcycle. Based on the market assumptions outlined earlier, we expect revenue to grow at a mid-teens compound annual growth rate over the next two years. We also expect operating margins to expand by about 400 basis points by 2023 and thus return to 2014 margin levels.  We are committed to driving significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multi-year upcycle unfolds. This earnings power results from the execution of Halliburton's strategic priorities. I am confident that our focus on technology differentiation, digital adoption, and capital efficiency positions us for profitable growth internationally and maximizing value in North America.  Now, I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Lance?
Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. And good morning. Let me begin with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2021. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.7 billion and operating income was $434 million, an increase of 7% and 17% respectively. Higher equipment utilization and our significant operating leverage supported these strong results as rig counts moved up globally in the second quarter.  Now, let me take a moment to discuss our division results in a little more detail. Starting with our Completion and Production division, revenue was $2 billion, an increase of 10%, while operating income was $317 million or an increase of 26%. These improvements were driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in North America land, improved cementing activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America, increased completion tool sales in the Middle East, the North Sea and Latin America, as well as higher well intervention services in Saudi Arabia and Algeria. These improvements were partially offset by lower stimulation activity in Latin America.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $1.7 billion, an increase of 5%, while operating income was $175 million or an increase of 2%. These results were driven by improved drilling-related services and wireline activity across all regions, along with increased testing services in the Eastern Hemisphere. Partially offsetting these improvements were reduced software sales globally.  Moving on to our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 12%, primarily driven by higher pressure pumping services, drilling related services and wireline activity in North America land, as well as higher well construction activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced software sales across the region.  Turning to Latin America, revenue was flat sequentially, primarily driven by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Mexico, higher fluid services in Brazil, as well as additional completion tool sales in Guyana. These results were offset by lower stimulation activity in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil, decreased software sales across the region, and lower project management activity in Mexico and Ecuador.  In Europe, Africa, CIS, revenue increased 7%, resulting from increased activity across multiple product service lines in Russia, Norway, Algeria, and Ghana. These increases were partially offset by lower software sales across the region and lower activity in Nigeria.  In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased 5%, resulting from improved activity in multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, improved well intervention services across the region, increased drilling-related services in Oman, higher completion tool sales in Kuwait, improved well construction activity in Australia and increased pipeline services in China. These improvements were offset by lower software sales across the region, reduced project management activity in India and lower overall activity in Bangladesh.  In the second quarter, our corporate and other expenses totaled $58 million. For the third quarter, we expect our corporate expense to remain largely unchanged.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $120 million and should remain flat for the third quarter. We remain focused on reducing our leverage in the near term, and recently announced the redemption of our remaining 2021 senior notes at par ahead of schedule in August using cash on hand, which should reduce interest expense beyond the third quarter.  Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in better than expected at approximately 22%, benefiting from several one-time discrete items. Based on our anticipated geographic earnings mix, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $190 million and will continue to ramp up for the remainder of the year. However, we will stay within our full-year target of 5% to 6% of revenue.  Turning to cash flow, we generated $409 million of cash from operations and $265 million of free cash flow during the second quarter. We believe that our year-to-date and expected earnings performance for the remainder of the year, combined with efficient working capital management, should result in a full-year free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. The growth and earnings outlook that Jeff laid out positions us well to grow our free cash flow over the next couple of years.  Now, let me turn to our near-term outlook. In the international markets, we expect a steady increase in activity as the rig counts continued to recover. In North America, we anticipate modest pricing improvement and continued activity momentum in both completions and drilling, but sequential activity growth will be slower than in prior quarters. As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate high single-digit revenue growth sequentially, with margins expected to modestly increase by 25 basis points to 50 basis points.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue growth of 3% to 5% due to continued rig count increases globally and a margin increase similar to that of our C&P division.  I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff? 
Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. Before I wrap up our discussion today, I want to thank our employees for their terrific execution on our value proposition, dedication to Halliburton, and excellent service delivery for our customers.  Now, let me summarize what we believe and expect will unfold. We're in the early innings of a multi-year upcycle. As oil demand exceeds supply, the macro environment will be constructive for both international and US markets. Halliburton's unique value proposition, integrated service portfolio and differentiated technologies position us to outperform in this market.  We have significant growth potential in new markets with our specialty chemicals and artificial lift businesses. Our technical differentiation allows us to disproportionately benefit from equipment capacity tightening across markets. Improved pricing, higher utilization, and our significant operating leverage will deliver strong incrementals for Halliburton in this upcycle.  We will continue to execute on our strategic priorities and remain committed to driving strong double-digit growth, margin expansion, significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders as this multi-year upcycle unfolds.  And now, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
James West: Thanks. Good morning, John.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, James.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, James.
James West: Jeff, you gave a great outline of what you see as this multi-year expansion for the business. And we certainly agree with what you're suggesting. How do your customers – when you're looking at the mosaic of all your different customers and all the different regions, are they aligned with kind of that view that it's time to get after it, we need to put some supply into the market and get going?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think what we're looking at today is the macro. When we talk to our customers, particularly publics, they're going to do exactly what they've said they're going to do, and I think we see that playing out. But we also have a good view of the macro in terms of supply and demand. And I think, from that perspective, the planet will demand oil. Where does it come from? Clearly, we've got line of sight to improving activity internationally. I describe that primarily with NOCs. And yes, I think that it's not zeal, it’s steady march to produce more barrels. And then I think that the call back on the U.S. is simply going to be that – that underinvestment that we've seen for a number of years internationally, it doesn't just spring back into action. And I think that's very positive for North America. So, from a customer perspective, obviously, the privates are much more opportunistic around the supportive oil price. So, we see quite a bit of activity and outlook from them.
James West: Right, right. As then as we think about the returns on the assets that you are putting into the field, right now, we're probably at a sub-optimal type of return levels. So, you need prices to go up. And so, what are the levers? Or how quickly do you think pricing can move in this market to get back to what you need – would want to achieve to drive returns higher?
Jeff Miller: Well, James, it's a process and it's probably multiple iterations. But I think we're seeing net pricing to a certain degree today in the U.S. slow going, but moving. And as we work through into 2022, I expect that continues to accelerate.  Internationally, I think it takes on the same type of dynamics that we saw in 2019, where markets, individual markets see tightness, see pricing, large tenders remain very competitive. And from our perspective, that worked well for Halliburton in 2019 and into the first quarter of 2020.  And we've been very clear, I think, about profitable growth. And so, I think it's key when I think about growth internationally, the key words there being profitable growth. And so that means that – and we see multiple years of growth in front of us. And for that reason, want to be deliberate about how we put equipment to work and make money. 
James West: Right. Right, got it. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, James.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.
David Anderson: Hey, good morning, Jeff. Some clearly very bullish comments looking out over the next couple of years. I was wondering if you could talk about maybe some of the signs that you're seeing on the international side, particularly with the Middle East NOCs. Now, you've talked about increased completion tool sales, some artificial lift contracts and other tenders. Yesterday, Aramco suggests maybe shifting 6 billion more into upstream. I was just wondering when you start to see this inflect and when does it come through. We haven't yet seen the rig count pick up. Does 3Q guide indicate sort of a similar outpace of activity from second quarter? But at the same time, Middle East feels like it should be leading that double-digit growth – the double-digit guidance next year. I was wondering if you could just help me kind of understand that trajectory. Maybe it's obviously not a very opaque – or it's more of an opaque market. Just help us kind of see what you're seeing in that part of the world?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean, what we see is, let's say, broadly, Middle East adding activity, adding it sort of as we speak, but more so focused towards next year. So, I think that we see – well, I think second half to second half, we're going to be up probably mid double digits for 2021 versus 2020. So, where does that come from? I think that alone is increasing and we see that sort of across the Middle East. But we also see it in Argentina, as an example. We see it in other parts of the market. And so, I think that gets traction and continues to get traction as we go further into 2022. But the activities – the demand signs are there now that we're seeing, and I think we see growth. But I think that continues to accelerate as we get into 2022 and 2023. But it doesn't necessarily overcome all the underinvestment. So, I think that there's work to be done to grow that business for operators to grow production, I think we see signs of growth now. But I think it'll be more pronounced in 2022. And we’ve described 2021 as a transition year. So, we still see COVID slowdowns in markets. There's a number of rigs that aren't working because they're not staffed today, not by us, but just in general. And so, that type of disruption is weighing down on things a bit. But I fully expect this to work through that through the balance of 2021.
David Anderson: Okay, that’s good to hear. Kind of a different topic. I just wanted to ask about kind of some of the inflation that maybe you're seeing on the North American side, particularly maybe if it impacted your C&P margins at all this quarter. I know you're not really seeing any net - real net pricing right now. But I'm just kind of curious what the E&Ps are seeing in terms of inflation. Are we talking like 5% these days? And sort of around that same question, wondering about labor. If we do see this increase next year in E&P budgets and assuming completion crews are added over the next 12 months, the industry doesn't really seem ready for that labor-wise. I'm just kind of curious how that inflation could kind of start working its way through. And obviously, that could lead to net pricing at some point. But maybe just talk about some of those components that you're seeing on the North America side, please?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean, I can speak to what we see in terms of inflation. And we saw inflation in many parts of our business, whether it's maintenance, in particular, cost, parts and people to do it. But we've also been able to pass that along. And in certain cases get – I think as we get through the second half of this year, we're seeing some net pricing now. And I think we'll see more of that more so as we go into 2022. But the ability to recover inflation is an important step also. In the range, is it 5% to 10%, 5%? It moves all around depending on the category. From a people perspective, we've been able to staff our equipment. We've got a very large footprint and have access to lots of people. And so, yeah, we have seen some attrition or turnover, but we've also been able to replace folks fairly efficiently.
David Anderson: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.
Chase Mulvehill: I guess first thing, really appreciate you guys kind of giving some visibility over your outlook for the next couple of years on kind of top line and margins. And kind of looking back, if we were to go back to kind of pre kind of 2014 levels and basically look at the prior decade, you sustained 20% plus EBITDA margins for basically a decade and that even includes the 2009 downturn. And so, you've given us guidance that EBITDA margins will get comfortably above 20% over the next couple of years. So, I guess two questions. Number one, when do you think we will get back to that 20% EBITDA mark? Are you comfortable that it's first half of next year, second half of next year? And then, once we get there, how sustainable is 20% EBITDA margins? We haven't been above 20% since before 2014. But how sustainable do you think the 20% EBITDA margins will be over the next cycle?
Jeff Miller: I think I've given you my outlook over the next couple of years. And so, over that period of time, we approach and then exceed those numbers that we got to in 2016. I think the most important part of this is the sustainability of that. And I feel like we see the strengthening macro and our unique competitive position in the marketplace very sustainable. I think we're back on to footing that we have to produce more, the things that we do to create value become more important. An example being the technology and our equipment in North America or our drilling technology, different elements of technology, whether it's digital or lift. But all of those things are what are so important in a market that requires more barrels, and that's what we see unfolding. And so, I think very sustainable. I've described it as the early innings. I think these are the early innings of at least a nine inning game to be played. And so, I really am convicted and excited about the outlook.
Chase Mulvehill: A quick follow-up. You've given us this couple year outlook. Obviously, that's going to lead to some pretty strong free cash flow. You're paying down the 2021 notes here. So, what's the plan for excess free cash flow as we kind of get into 2022 and leverage ratios get to more comfortable levels? Is it a dividend bump? Special dividends, buybacks, M&A, or just maybe just build cash on the balance sheet?
Lance Loeffler: You're right. In the near term, we're focused on trimming our debt levels. I think that that focus – good example of that focus is what we plan to do this month or early next, actually, with the $500 million maturity that we have coming due, paying it down with cash. Look, I think we're getting to a point where we're continuing to strive to cut our debt levels and get back to that 2 times debt to EBITDA leverage ratio that we've talked about before. But I think we are getting to a point where we intend to return more cash to shareholders, whether in the form of a dividend or share repurchase, not willing to commit to that at this point. But it's certainly something that we think is an and type scenario. So, we continue to trim our level of debt and improve the level of cash that we send back to shareholders.
Operator: Next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. 
Scott Gruber: I wanted to get some more color on the encouraging pricing trends here in North America. Is the net pricing that you're garnering, is that going to impact margins much in the second half? I ask because when you look at the 3Q guide, the embedded incrementals look to be kind of on the order of 20-ish-percent. And I would just think it'd be something greater than that if it's really having a big impact. Is there just a time lag here? Are there other offsets, maybe on equipment sales? Or do we just really need to see a little bit more activity growth to see pricing take a bigger leg higher into 2022?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. As I said, it's not across the board. It is a process, but we are seeing net pricing in certain pockets and certain things today, and I expect that that accelerates, as I said, into 2022. But, clearly, with frac ESG friendly equipment that is in very short supply, we have a leading position in dual fuel electric, tier 4 also. And so, in all those categories, that's what the market demands and that's an – structurally, because of our large footprint there, we have a structurally differentiated position, but that equipment isn't everywhere and that equipment is some under contract, some is not under – it's moving. I think what's important at this point is that we're negotiating up and not down, and that's sort of a different dialogue than what we've had. And that's what we're seeing today. So, do you see all of that in Q3? Absolutely not. But what you do is you see us on a journey now that's different than the one that we've been on. And that's where we are.
Scott Gruber: Turning to the digital contract wins, which are great to see, couple of questions there on the impact on margins. First, just so we can dimension it. Do the digital revenues and margin also flow through D&E? Or when you have Completion and Production [indiscernible], does some of it hit C&P? More importantly, how do we think about the real timing and magnitude of the benefit to margins? Is there much of a benefit during the second half through the initial deployment and scaling up in places like Kuwait? Or is it more to come in 2022 and 2023? Particularly for D&E, it's been a segment where you guys have been pushing to structurally lift margins over the last couple of years. How do the digital wins in the digitization of the industry and Halliburton's participation really push where the D&E margin could go on a more normalized basis as we get deep into recovery?
Jeff Miller: When we think about digital, digital margin impact is across the business. Obviously, the software sales and the cloud native apps are in D&E. But more broadly, digital capability affects the whole business. And so, that's behind our [indiscernible] products, so tools like EarthStar and our SmartFleet, all of those are a byproduct of having digital capability in the company. In fact, the capacity to develop software at scale is pretty unique. And that is what allows that to happen.  The third way we consume software, and this has an impact also on the entire business, is the ability to consume the solutions ourselves and reduce our own costs. So, I would argue a large part of our ability to, for example, last year, reduce the roofline by 50% was rooted in our ability to do things digitally that remove many steps and change the processes and took people out. That's why I'm careful how we describe that.  I think that, clearly, it's a contribution to D&E. But I would say that the contracts we've described are all good contracts, but you ramp up – it might ramp up, they get started. It's a consultative process. And so, I would expect later this year or really more so into 2022 and beyond. I think these build one on top of another and become very sustainable over time, less of a sort of pop all at once, but sort of building into larger projects over time. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler.
Ian Macpherson: The one question that I had, Jeff, is when you look at double-digit trajectory for synchronized expansion for North America and international, just given the strong command that OPEC+ has over the oil market over the intermediate term, what type of call on US production growth are Ae you contemplating which underpins your North American outlook for the next couple of years?
Jeff Miller: We think that some of what we've seen over the last couple of days, I think, lays out a path for OPEC. And so, that's, to a certain degree, defined. If we look at pent up demand for oil at least today – if we look up the pent up demand that we see for oil today, we're at 98 million barrels a day now, the economy feels more than 2 million barrels shut in, to me. In fact, it's probably 4 million barrels consumed in aviation alone. So, I think there's a normalized level of spare capacity that's expected. So then when we think, okay, North America, what happens there? Well, we're up 10% year-on-year. And I think the expectation is that production is largely flat for this year. I would expect that there would be a call of – is it 500,000 barrels, some number like that? Some level of growth that would be called on in 2022. That, the price clearly supports, which would then drive more activity for us, certainly, and we have – in that mix is stemming the decline curve that is always working on North America production. So, those are the things that underpin our outlook.
Ian Macpherson: And then, staying on the domestic pressure pumping side, we're obviously beginning to see some of the smaller competitors announce firm plans and sort of abstract plans for renewing their fleets with clean fleet, but different iterations of it. In your view, is that coming earlier than you would like to see it? Or do you think that the market is ready to support the pricing and the returns for that equipment at the scale that we've already seen over the last few months? And should we expect Halliburton within your 5% to 6% CapEx and below to march along at that same industry cadence with new clean fleet investment?
Jeff Miller: Well, if we always look at our – we're fortunate today that we have one of the youngest fleets in the market. And as we replace equipment, we also have a large fleet. And so, as we systematically replace equipment, we have a choice to make. So, what type of equipment do we replace it with? And it's a combination, generally, of electric or dual fuel. But I think that our steady drumbeat of replacements and within our 5% to 6% of capital spend, we're able to meet demand and also at terms that are adequate. I think those two things have to be in place. Fortunately, we're in a position where we are able to deliver those things today. I say today, but today and over the near term from operations. Remains to be seen the pace at which all of that can happen in the market, given where sort of broadly that market stands today in terms of returns. So, without the returns, it's not – we wouldn't be investing in these types of equipment at all. Fortunately, we're in a position to do so and do it ratably along with our sort of planned replacement cycle.
Operator: Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Mehta: Congrats on a good quarter here. I have a really high level question. It's been a tough 10 years for the energy sector, but it's been an even tougher period of time for oil services relative to the rest of energy. Jeff, as a leader of this industry, what do you think the key is to attract the generalist investor back into this vertical within the space? Do you think it's about earnings execution? Is it about returns on capital? Or is it about returning excess capital to shareholders, so return of capital?
Jeff Miller: It has to be all three of those. But I think it starts with some clarity around what is the trajectory over time that's sustainable as opposed to all of the ups and downs that we seem to have had sort of intra-period gyrations. And I think what's shaping up today, as I've described it, is a more sort of predictable, sustainable trajectory. And that's what we see out over the next couple of years and really beyond that, just because I think we've been through a lot of the over-capitalization. There's been under investment for a long enough period of time, particularly in the resource that, as demand recovers, which it will recover, I think there's a solid opportunity set for our services.  Now, within that, obviously, I have a view that – and believe firmly that our competitive positioning is different also. And because of that, Halliburton has tools, whether it's our value proposition, our technology or sort of our portfolio and how it's placed to maximize value in North America, which we've always been clear on. We want to maximize value in North America and grow profitably internationally. And I think both those macros are set up perfectly for doing that. And so, as a generalist, there's some clarity around where we're going. We've got some track record of where we've been, where we're going. And I think that sets up well for a generalist investor. 
Neil Mehta: The follow-up on that on on return of capital, if you look at the energy sector, S&P energy sector, it trades at a 4.5% dividend yield. How do you think about Halliburton's value proposition on a multi-year basis around return of capital, whether it's through dividends or through buybacks? Do you ultimately need to be offering a total return of capital yield that's far in excess to the market, given the questions about the terminal value of the business? 
Lance Loeffler: Neil, I think it's a great question. And I think that we're going to continue to reevaluate what it means for us in the near term as we continue to grow into this recovery. We certainly believe that we need to improve those yields today on a dividend basis. But we're going to continue to look at and get comfortable with the forward free cash flow profile, what we think that this business, we believe, can generate in these out years that Jeff discussed. But, clearly, we believe it requires improvement from where we are today. 
Jeff Miller: Maybe one follow on to that, Neil. Strategically, we have changed the cash flow profile of our business, and that is the shift from 10%, 11% of revenues going into capital down to the 5% to 6%. But what that does is that sets Halliburton up to do those things. And so, I think it's our view and the change in our cash flow profile certainly aid that process.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron JR [ph] with J.P. Morgan.
Unidentified Participant: My first question relates to just the activity mix in the US. The privates have added more than 70% of the incremental rigs since the activity bottomed mid last year. I guess my first question is, what is your expectation around, call it, the mix of public company activity next year once some of the OPEC barrels are returned? And do you think that a higher mix of public company activity is – are you indifferent about that? Or do you think it's helpful to your revenue growth and margin opportunities relative to industry next year? 
Jeff Miller: I think we will always look for the best return opportunity for us. I'd say operators have not said anything about next year, and I'm not going to project what they might say. I think I have – we can see what the demand sort of looks like to us as we look out into next year. But I also think that every operator will make their own decisions around how they deploy their capital. And overall, a supportive commodity price, which we see creates headroom for our clients to do work and return cash to their shareholders, which is important for them to do. So, I think the improving commodity price and the structural sort of support that we will see in the commodity price makes all of that work as we go into 2022. 
Neil Mehta: Just my follow-up. We had a dynamic, particularly in the US, where budget exhaustion has led to some frac holidays which has obviously been a headwind. How is Halliburton looking to mitigate that risk as we approach the back half and the fourth quarter kind of given that dynamic?
Jeff Miller: I think operators are going to do exactly what they said they would do. And we really haven't seen budget exhaustion, to this point haven't talked about it. And I think that is because operators are ratably doing exactly what they said they were going to do. So, I don't anticipate that we see any of that or much of that this year. And I'd say the other thing that we've done a lot of work to variabilize our business, such that when we see slowdowns or holds or anything else, we're able to respond to it very, very quickly as opposed to how we might have done it in the past. And that all is process change and really philosophy change, but it's working quite well. I think we'll have a solid sort of working through the balance of the year just because of the clarity that our clients have and are providing to us. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.
Connor Lynagh: I wanted to return to the multi-year outlook you guys gave. And basically, what I'm wondering is, certainly, I know you want to stick to the ranges you put out there for capital expenditures, but I would assume there's a certain degree of growth investment required to realize that. So, I was wondering if you could discuss just where you plan on allocating capital, what some of the big areas that you think are sort of priorities within the business over the next couple years here?
Jeff Miller: I think that as we look out, I believe that we've got the opportunity to meet those expectations within the guidance that we've provided with respect to CapEx. I think there is growth CapEx in that sort of 5% to 6% range that we've provided. For example, if I look back over the last five years, asset turns have improved by 50%. That's strong improvement. But this is back to my commentary around strategically approaching capital efficiency. So, as we're very sharp around our R&D dollars, drive capital efficiency, our process drives capital efficiency, and those are the kind of results we see in terms of capital efficiency. And so, we will continue to drive that as the market expands over the next couple of years. And really, strategically, that becomes our operating process. And I expect we'll continue to do that.
Connor Lynagh: Sort of similar question here. But just in terms of thinking about – particularly your labor pool, and I guess, your overhead in international markets, so certainly, you've right-sized in select areas, but you're anticipating a pretty big recovery here. I guess I'm just curious, it seems like in the outlook there's an acceleration in incremental margins as you get out into some of the later years. Is that because you have sort of excess labor that's going to be more highly utilized, is that because of the pricing that you're anticipating. Just curious what the what the big drivers are of that improvement in incremental margins?
Lance Loeffler: Look, Connor, I think it's less about cost savings structurally. I think it's more about volume of activity combined with price. So, it's volume, utilization and pricing improvement throughout the course of that journey that Jeff sort of outlined. 
Jeff Miller: We're always working on costs. We've got a continuous improvement program where we're constantly driving, managing costs down. And I believe that that program and our approach to that is adequate. As we grow, we will manage the cost. But clearly, we expect to see tightness in pricing and more activity over time that all drives incrementals. 
Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. 
Jeff Miller: Before we end the call, let me close with this. We are in the early innings of an unfolding multi-year upcycle that presents growth opportunities for Halliburton internationally and in North America. Those opportunities match Halliburton's unique customer-focused value proposition and our position as the only fully integrated energy services company in both international and North American markets. As this unfolds, we remain committed to driving returns and free cash flow for Halliburton shareholders. I'm optimistic about what lies ahead and look forward to speaking with you next quarter.  Shannon, please close out the call. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-21 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Halliburton’s First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Abu Zeya: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2021 conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton’s website for 7 days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020; recent current reports on Form 8-K; and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.  Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments asset dispositions and other charges. Beginning this quarter, we have modified our free cash flow metric, a non-GAAP financial measure to include the impact of Proceeds from sales of property, plant, and equipment. We believe this item is recurring in nature and including it improves comparability of this metric relative to our large cap peers. Additional details including recalculation of this measure for prior periods and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter earnings release and can also be found in the quarterly results and Presentation section of our website.  After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period to allow time for others who maybe in the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Abu, and good morning everyone. We are off to a good start this year. The world is reopening and even though some regions still experience lockdowns, overall economic and demand recovery continues to build. Oil demand is increasing globally. Oil inventories are down near their five-year averages, and OPEC+ actions continue to support commodity prices. The first quarter strengthened our confidence about how this transition year will play out.  Our first quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy and operating leverage in this global market recovery. Here are some highlights. International revenue grew 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Marketing and activity inflection in the international markets, strong recovery in Latin America more than offset declines in other regions, while margins remained resilient.  North America revenue grew 13% as both drilling and completions activity ramped up throughout the quarter. Higher utilization and our significant operating leverage supported sequential margin expansion despite weather disruptions.  Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 3% with increased North America and Latin America activity offsetting seasonal declines in other regions. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered solid revenue and margin performance. Revenue grew 11% while margins increased 2.6 percentage points, driven by stronger drilling activity in North America and software sales across multiple regions.  Finally, we delivered approximately $160 million of free cash flow in the first quarter, which is a great first step to delivering strong free cash flow for the full year. This was another quarter of solid execution on our five strategic priorities that define Halliburton’s path and will drive our success.  We are committed to drive profitable growth internationally; maximize value in North America; accelerate and integrate digital technologies; improve capital efficiency; and actively participate in advancing cleaner affordable energy.  Our first quarter performance demonstrated that aligning our actions with these strategic priorities boosts our returns and free cash flow generation. We expect to continue delivering strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns as we move through the year. We are encouraged by the inflection in international activity we saw during the first quarter and anticipate that recovery will gain momentum across all regions in the second quarter and beyond.  Today, we see early indicators of future activity growth internationally. Our completion tool orders, a leading indicator of upcoming orders grew throughout the first quarter. The volume of tender work has significantly increased. We are on pace to nearly double the value of submitted bids compared to last year with the most work coming from the NOCs in the Middle East, followed by Latin America.  These signs give us greater conviction that the second half of this year will see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year. We believe the international markets will experience multiple years of growth. However, this upcycle is expected to be structurally different from prior cycles and Halliburton’s international business is better prepared to benefit from it.  Here is why. We expect the NOCs and other short cycle barrel producers will increase investments and gain share to meet future oil demand growth. Halliburton has the established footprint and the customer relationships to capitalize on this growth. As deals become smaller and more complex, operators work harder to produce more barrels.  Their pursuit of incremental production to meet future oil demand growth should require higher service intensity. In certain markets, maturing assets are changing hands. New owners require proven technology and experience to revitalize their assets and unlock remaining reserves. Halliburton’s broad technology portfolio, local expertise, and commercial flexibility are helping these customers achieve their efficiencies and production objectives.  Multiple years of service company CapEx reductions limit equipment availability in the international markets. In early 2020, pre-COVID, international pricing was beginning to increase on the back of equipment tightness, but paused with the oil demand collapse. As the world reopens and activity rebounds, we expect large tenders to remain competitive, but leading edge pricing should increase. Our strategic priority is clear; deliver profitable growth as the expected international recovery unfolds. We believe the following factors will help us accomplish this: first, we expect our ongoing investment in technology innovations to benefit us as the market recovers.  For example, as the global leader in completions technology, we introduced the Ovidius Expanding Isolation Packer. Ovidius uses material science innovation to transform a metal alloy into a rock-like material when it reacts with downhole fluids. It creates a long-lasting seal for improved well integrity and is specially suited for high pressure and high temperature environments, as well as permanent plug and abandonment operations. Our completion tools R&D pipeline incorporates the latest advancements in material science, sensors, telemetry and digitalization. Ovidius is one good example of this pipeline. The successful rollout of our iCruise intelligent drilling system continues to deliver excellent results.  In the first quarter, iCruise improved drilling speeds 55% for a customer in the Middle East; saved an operator three days of rig time in the North Sea and increased drilling rates 25% compared to offset wells in offshore China. Second, our Production business continues to expand internationally with unique growth opportunities. We plan to start executing on our first multiyear electric submersible pump contract in the Middle East in the second half of this year.  We see significant volume and future growth potential for artificial lift solutions in the Middle East as many mature fields across the region come off natural flow and require ESPs to sustain production. With proven Summit ESP technology, a strong local presence, and a focus on profitable growth, we expect to thrive in this market. As we progress towards completing our specialty chemicals plant in Saudi Arabia, we are actively participating in regional tendering activity. In addition to providing new business opportunities, this plant will also manufacture chemicals for our internal consumption. We expect the new plant to deliver cost savings and profitable growth for Halliburton in 2022 and beyond. Finally, we are accelerating the deployment and integration of digital technologies with our customers. We believe digital creates technological differentiation, contributes to higher international margins, and drives internal efficiencies.  In the first quarter, we introduced a new real-time data transmission system for a major customer in the North Sea. This high fidelity, low latency data highway is an essential building block for virtual remote operations that are performed without human intervention and use real-time data and tailored algorithms. We also launched a new digital workflow on a private cloud for an integrated services contract in the Middle East.  This workflow helps our employees make better decisions. It uses a proprietary natural language processing service to extract specific information from a variety of documents and locate associated data in our data lake. This is digital technology in action facilitating collaboration and knowledge management, while improving operational efficiencies. These digital technologies are important milestones in our journey from digital planning to virtual execution. We are using our open architecture platform to integrate real-time information from the customer, Halliburton’s many digitally-enabled technologies and third-party providers across the entire asset.  I believe that Halliburton’s current strengths and new capabilities will deliver profitable growth in a multi-year international recovery. Today, North America is staging a healthy recovery. In the current oil price environment, shale operators have a larger portfolio of economically viable projects. As a result, the average U.S. land rig count grew 27% sequentially in the first quarter, outpacing the growth in completed stages.  We still expect the majority of our customers to remain committed to a disciplined capital program this year. But what we are seeing today solidifies our confidence in a steady activity cadence for the rest of the year as operators work to maintain their productive capacity. The market dynamics continue to improve.  Supportive commodity prices should allow our customers to spend their announced budgets and meet their cash flow objectives. Customer mix should transition as the year unfolds. Privates led the recovery in the first half and we expect some public companies to increase activity in the second half of the year.  Halliburton serves both of these customer groups aligning with operators that have longer term and more efficient programs. As a result, demand for our equipment is increasing and our calendar is filling up for the rest of the year. Last year, we used digital technology to redesign our service delivery approach and create significant differentiation in our cost structure. Adding to our cost reset in 2020, we continued to drive cost out of our North America operations.  As an example, we’ve engaged with Vorto, a software company that designed an artificial intelligence supply chain platform to transform how we buy, move, and sell sand and trucking within our U.S. Land Operations.  Without human intervention, Vorto’s platform optimizes thousands of logistics loads per day while also identifying and addressing issues before they occur. This fits with our strategic priorities to use digital technology to drive down costs in our business and to maximize value in North America. Together with our size and scale, our sustainable operating leverage should widen our margin differential relative to our competitors in North America. We are steadily improving margins and our first quarter performance was another step in the right direction.  As we look ahead, we see upside to our margin performance based on utilization, technology, innovation, and pricing. Utilization is the first step to better margins with a smaller equipment base and the right customer alignment we intend to continue optimizing utilization as market demand grows. Given our scale, the operating leverage impact from utilization increases alone should improve our cash flow generation in North America. Technological differentiation and digital innovation is the next step. Halliburton has the leading low emission solutions in the market today, both electric and dual fuel and we expect they will command a premium as market demand expands. As the leader in hydraulic fracturing, Halliburton has the scale and R&D depths to deliver a proven power-agnostic, capital efficient solution for e-frac. Deployed in the Permian Basin, our fully integrated all-electric frac site includes our 5,000 horsepower Zeus electric pumping unit, our new ExpressBlend blending system, E-Winch electric wireline unit and the electric tech command center built using our flagship Q10 pumps, Zeus delivers performance levels up to 40% higher than conventional pumps and substantially reduces emissions limited only by the grid power source. As certain components of our input costs rise, we are working with our suppliers and our customers to adjust our gross pricing in line with cost inflation we are seeing in the market. While improving U.S. economic activity and winter weather disruptions led to increases in sand, chemicals, cement additives, and raw materials costs, Halliburton’s purchasing power and technology have allowed us to procure and deliver these materials in a cost-efficient manner, such that both Halliburton and our customers are more competitive. Service pricing improvement is the final step. We are not there yet but we see positive signs of market rebalancing that should drive future pricing improvements. Total fracturing equipment capacity has limited room to grow in the current pricing environment.  Continued attrition from the rising service intensity and insufficient returns for many service companies is altering the industry dynamics, because we are an integrated provider, Halliburton participates in all key businesses in North America today and we will benefit more than others when pricing moves up. We believe that Halliburton’s leadership and strength in North America will allow us to take advantage of positive market dynamics and deliver on our strategic priority to maximize value in this market. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to turn every knob to manage greater capital efficiency and drive solid free cash flow generation.  This takes many forms and includes important technology advancements and multiple product service lines whether digital or equipment related, process changes that improve the speed with which we move equipment and respond to market opportunities.  And finally, actions to reduce the pace of working capital consumption required to grow our business. The first quarter was a good demonstration of this and we will continue to build on these actions. We are also executing on our strategic priority to advance cleaner affordable energy and to support sustainable energy advancements using innovation and technology to reduce the environmental impact of producing oil and gas.  Halliburton has a three-prong approach to achieving this objective. First, we recently released our target to achieve 40% reduction in Scope one and two emissions by 2035 from the 2018 baseline. This is consistent with our goal to reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of our operations and follows our commitment to set science-based targets announced last year. Second, we are innovating. We continue to develop and deploy low carbon solutions to help oil and gas operators lower their current emissions profiles. We also use our existing technologies in renewable energy applications.  For example, today, the geothermal market in Europe is growing rapidly and represents an attractive expansion opportunity for our artificial lift business. We are currently supplying electric submersible pumps specifically designed for the high temperature, large well bore applications on the geothermal project in Germany.  We are also providing drilling and cementing services for geothermal wells in Indonesia. We developed new high temperature cementing formulations and directional drilling techniques that increase geothermal sites’ generating capacity and improve project economics. And finally, we are excited about the progress of Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. In the first quarter, we announced Halliburton Labs’ inaugural group of participating companies.  They are working on solutions for transforming organic and plastic waste to renewable power, recycling of lithium-ion batteries and converting carbon dioxide, water and renewable electricity into a hydrogen-rich platform chemical. We are collaborating with these companies and providing world-class industrial capabilities and expertise to help them achieve further scale and increase their valuations.  This engagement in the clean energy space will inform Halliburton’s future strategic decisions as the energy transition evolves. We are taking applications for the next cohort of participants as we continue bringing early-stage clean energy companies in to Halliburton Labs. To sum up, we entered 2021 optimistic and focused on innovation. We believe that the early positive momentum in North America will continue and the international market recovery will accelerate in the second half of the year. Halliburton will continue to execute on our key strategic priorities to deliver industry-leading returns and solid free cash flow as the anticipated multi-year recovery unfolds. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Lance?
Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. Let’s begin this morning with an overview of our first quarter results, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.5 billion, an increase of 7% and our operating income was $370 million, an increase of 6%, compared to the adjusted operating income of $350 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Now, let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in a little bit more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $1.9 billion or an increase of 3%, while operating income was $252 million, representing a decrease of 11%.  The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher stimulation and artificial lift activity in North America, higher cementing activity in the North Sea, as well as improved stimulation activity in Argentina and Mexico and higher completion tools sales in Latin America. These increases were partially offset by lower cementing services in Russia, lower pressure pumping activity in the Middle East, reduced seasonal completion tool sales and lower well intervention services in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Operating income was negatively impacted primarily by decreased completion tool sales and reduced pressure pumping activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. Our Drilling and Evaluation revenue was $1.6 billion or an increase of 11%, while operating income was $171 million, an increase of 46%. These increases were primarily due to higher software sales globally, improved drilling-related services and wireline activity in the Western Hemisphere and Norway and increased project management activity internationally. Partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related services across Asia. Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue was $1.4 billion, representing an increase of 13%. These results were primarily driven by higher drilling-related services, stimulation and artificial lift activity in North America Land, as well as higher wireline activity and software sales in North America Land and the Gulf of Mexico. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced completion tool sales and lower cementing and fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Moving to Latin America, revenue was $535 million, representing an increase of 26% resulting primarily from increased activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina and Mexico, as well as higher fluid services in the Caribbean. Partially offsetting these improvements was reduced activity across multiple product service lines in Colombia. Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, revenue was $634 million, a 1% decrease sequentially, resulting mainly from reduced completion tool sales and well intervention services across the region, coupled with lower activity in Russia and lower fluid services in Kazakhstan. These decreases were partially offset by higher well construction activity in the North Sea and increased software sales across the region. In Middle East Asia, revenue was $878 million or a 6% decrease. These results were primarily driven by lower stimulation and well intervention services in the Middle East, reduced drilling-related activity in Indonesia and China, and lower completion tool sales across the region. Partially offsetting these declines were improved project management activity in Iraq and Saudi Arabia and higher wireline activity across Asia. In the first quarter, our corporate expense totaled $53 million. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate corporate expense to be slightly higher. Net interest expense for the quarter was $125 million and we expect this level of interest expense to drift slightly lower in the second quarter as a result of our reduced debt balance.  Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 23%. As we go forward into 2021, based on the anticipated market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. Turning to cash flow, we generated $203 million of cash from operations during the first quarter and $157 million of free cash flow. We also repaid $188 million in maturing debt with cash on hand in the first quarter and we’ll continue to prioritize reducing leverage in the near-term.  Capital expenditures during the quarter came in at $104 million. We expect capital equipment deliveries for international projects to ramp up in the second half of the year and as a result, our full year 2021 CapEx guidance remains unchanged. Finally, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we see the second quarter unfolding.  In North America, we expect both completions and drilling activity momentum to continue, but sequential activity growth should moderate. In the international markets, we expect a seasonal rebound and a broad based activity increase, the pace of which will vary across different regions.  As a result, for our Completion and Production division, we anticipate low double-digit revenue growth sequentially with margins expected to expand by 125 to 150 basis points as a result of our strong operating leverage across all markets. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate a mid-single digit revenue increase with margins declining 100 to 125 basis points sequentially. The moderate growth and anticipated reduction in margins are primarily attributed to the seasonal decline in our software sales globally. I’ll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?
Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. To sum up, I am optimistic about how this transition year is shaping up. The demand outlook continues to improve both internationally and domestically, even as some regions still experience lockdowns. This year is headed in the right direction and Halliburton is focused on the right things to deliver on our shareholders objectives.  We expect our strong international business to continue its profitable growth as activity increases throughout the year. In North America, our business has recovered and is demonstrating margin improvement on the back of our strong operating leverage. Digital is growing our revenue and helping us and our customers increase operational efficiency and reduce costs. Our commitment to capital efficiency is expected to support growth and solid free cash flow generation.  And finally, we believe that our strategy to advance cleaner affordable energy positions us well for the future. And now let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. 
James West : Morning guys. 
Jeff Miller: Morning, James. 
James West : So Jeff, clearly, international looks good in the back half where we are 90 days from your last conference call and obviously you announced [Photonics] [ph] in between. But your visibility on the second half and even more so on 2022, which I think is more important, should have increased at this point.  And so, I’d love to hear your thoughts on kind of how the international recovery takes shape, I understand you have double-digit year-over-year second half of this year, but really, as it kind of runs into 2022. How we should be thinking about regions, markets, so where the growth is going to be and then should that double-digit momentum continue?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, James. The – yes, confidence improving and visibility improving around our outlook both for 2021 and for 2022 and in fact, when we see – I see tender pipeline strong, strengthening, these are all sort of the things that start sometime later this year, but really start to get traction in 2022 and even 2023. Some of the programs that we are seeing are shorter cycle barrels, but the fact is, those are actually service intense barrels [defined] [ph] so it [indiscernible] going to drive more upstream spending faster and even if I look at just 2021 outlook confidence is more so today. I think earlier – we see it at a minimum improving to flat year-on-year which is an improvement from what we thought earlier. 
James West : Right. Okay. Okay. It makes sense. And then as we think about North America, obviously the big E&Ps are going to remain capital disciplined and probably show some really good cash flow this year given where the oil price is, but they’ll step up next year as it committed to spend a certain percentage of cash flow. So, are you starting to have conversations or started to think about 2022 as it reflects to North America and then kind of what the increase could be in spending as oil prices are 30% higher than they were going into this year?
Jeff Miller: Yes, James, I think we are going to see sort of the steady cadence of the increase as we move through this year and even into next year. I think, just the feedback and sense I get is that there is a lot of discipline around production and what they can do profitably and also think as we see improvement into 2022. They will face those service cost inflation just because of where everything is today, what needs to be replaced.  So, I don’t think it’s – it won’t be the – certainly won’t be the same and I think that tightening of capacity is very good for Halliburton and I think that anything that will be a bit of a governor. 
James West : Got you. Okay. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. 
Scott Gruber : Yes, good morning. 
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Scott. 
Scott Gruber : So, as you guys probably heard some of your investor conversations there has been some concern around Halliburton in terms of the C&P margins as we start the year just given the mix towards the domestic completion market and we heard the 2Q guide obviously. How should we be thinking about the second half and assuming no net pricing in the U.S. with the international side starting to accelerate, U.S. continuing to expand on a more efficient and streamlined platform, how should we think about second half incrementals and kind of some high level if could put some color around that? And can we do better than the 2Q pace which looks like to be around 25%?
Jeff Miller: Well, look, thanks, Scott. We are confident about the progression in North America certainly for C&P and globally. And I think that the – our goal is to maximize the value of this business and I’ve said I think we expect mid teens full year and I think that’s a solid number and that’s the reflecting and activity increase that is driving the incremental margins as opposed to pricing, no pricing in that.  And I think we have visibility towards what will drive pricing which will substantially improve, in fact super charge those incrementals. But I think right now, we are building our outlook around what is a steady cadence of improvement and maintaining, actually continuing to drive further efficiencies in North America with respect to keeping our cost. The reset that we did last year is still alive and well in place. 
Scott Gruber : Got you. And a similar question on the D&E side. Obviously, some noise on the margin front around the software sales. But maybe some color on the second half for D&E, I guess, the question is, in the past as we’ve seen the international side of the business accelerate off the bottom, we’ve often seen startup costs, [indiscernible] the margin improvement potential at least for a couple quarters at the start of the cycle. Is there risk of that this cycle or is that really diminished given the digital applications and streamlining the platform? How should we think about D&E margins expansion in the second half as things start to pick up internationally? 
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. Look, I think the D&E starting at a higher point than it did finished last year is important. I think it’s just two important things. One, our software business is strong and accretive and it also says though that the rest of the business margins, the breadth of D&E’s margins, the baseline is improving. And so, we are knocking on double-digits as we look out through the rest of the year.  As I look at the back half for the international expansion on D&E, we are positioned today for that. And so, the kind of investment we are making, we view it as of March. We want to continue to improve the baseline margins in that business. So, it’s continuing to improve. And so, I think we’ll see improvement in 2021. I think that continues beyond that.  And so, our outlook is for continuing to grow those margins. I don’t see the kind of headwinds that we might have seen a year ago when we were ramping for one of the largest contracts in the North Sea. I mean, I don’t see that repeat.  And in some of what we are getting also is the benefit of the capital efficiency that’s baked into a lot of our D&E ability to move things around. In fact, that’s at the core of our strategy is capital efficiency and I think that manifests itself around how we move tools and other things. 
Scott Gruber : Great. Appreciate the color, Jeff. Thank you. 
Jeff Miller: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays.
David Anderson : Hi, good morning, Jeff. I was just wondering if you could just talk briefly about the pressure pumping market. I certainly want to talk about DGB engines; E&P is increasingly looking to move away from diesel.  Some of it may be suggesting higher pricing on [indiscernible] equipment and I was just wondering if you could kind of tell us where you stand on this and are your customers pushing for this type of equipment? And are you starting to see any bifurcation in the market on pricing because of this? 
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, Dave. Look, I think as we look into the future, those types of solutions will get pricing earlier and more so. We are seeing more demand for those types of solutions. We have a leading position around whether it’s Tier-4 dual fuel or also the electric. And so, yes, we are seeing the demand. I think that the bifurcation will happen gradually simply because of the ability to do two things; one, put equipment into the market and so the way we look at that is that’s replacement equipment generally.  So we’ve got 10% to 12% of our equipment that goes off every year. And so, what we are able to do is replace that with what we view would be higher margin, better returning equipment over time, but that’s more of the pacing that we see.  And then the other sort of key components around pricing, I mean, when we look at all of this, but when we think about returns for new equipment – any kind of new equipment, but particularly technology we expect some premium around the technology and also derisking the time horizon impact of making those returns also I think that’s equally key. 
David Anderson : That makes sense. And then, if I could just switchover to the international side, you talked about improved project management activity in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. I was just wondering first, was there anything noteworthy behind this improvement?  Or is this more of the course of business, but kind of more importantly as you talk – look at the tendering activity out there, is this going to be a preferred contracting model for NOCs? I guess, assuming we are at the beginning of a multi-year growth phase and if so, are you comfortable increasing your exposure to project management activity? 
Jeff Miller: The answer to the first question, Dave, this is sort of normal course of business. We see improvements that we see more activity at different times. So, that’s really all to read through on that. I think the – with respect to project management broadly and how we see those contracts in the future, obviously, a lot of activity around that, we’ll be certainly very thoughtful around how we increase that exposure, we manage that risk. And in fact, the most important component of looking at those types of things is understanding and managing the risk. 
David Anderson : Of course.
Jeff Miller: And it’s one of the reasons also, you hear me say it a lot, but I am talking about profitable growth internationally. And so, that profitable component is going to be the lead punch around how we grow internationally. So we’ll take that. Certainly, we are in that business. We are good at that business. But we are also pretty circumspect around how we make money doing that. 
David Anderson : Thanks, Jeff. 
Jeff Miller: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. 
Sean Meakim : Thank you. Hey, good morning. 
Jeff Miller: Good morning. 
Lance Loeffler: Hey, Sean. 
Sean Meakim : So, C&P had pretty good quarter always considered, you expected some mix shift for the back half of the year. Private E&Ps led the very early recovery. You are suggesting some publics to add rigs in the back half. Does this also suggest that you think private E&Ps are mostly as what they can under the current oil price environment?  They have been – they are over half the rig count today. They are two-thirds of the rigs as of the trough. But their end economics are not that different maybe than from the publics’. So just curious your visibility on the private E&P activity for the balance of the year. 
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, I think that they are the most nimble groups. They are going to move the quick as to engage. They also have a leashed impact on the overall headline production number also. So I think that, I really am encouraged by the activity that we’ve seen. The ability to continue that. I think they are all making their own economic decisions and they make that really without a lot of stakeholder beyond the owners their direction.  And so, I think what we are seeing is a natural reaction to that. But I don’t think it’s indicative of how the whole market behaves. And so, they have the ability to get real busy and then, slow down and back it down as they see production start to ramp up a little bit for them and it changes their economics.  So, a hard march up into the right not necessarily I think they all make their own decisions and could easily – I am not going to say, back off, but what they will do is make those decisions as other operators start to ramp and that’s obviously a much more disciplined group. They have plans in place. I think the key point to make here though, we are at the end of the first quarter.  We are into Q2. And we haven’t talked about any of the kind of budget blow outs that we talked about in prior years where, I, oh, wow, we’ve overspent. So there is something coming that’s going to slow things down. That’s not all what we see.  In fact, what I am describing in terms of confidence and the cadence is, the confidence and the cadence that we are going to stay busy in marching through the second half of the year likely up some. In fact, I think our outlook today is up North America, maybe close to 10% on the full year. So, that’s some moderation, but that’s still growing. 
Sean Meakim : That’s a good point. I’d appreciate that feedback. On D&E results obviously impressively sort of unpacked the impact of seasonal software sales spilling into the first quarter. You have also been press releasing a lot of the new contracts and agreements tied to digital initiatives. So just curious how much of the confidence underlying your margin commentary is driven by the improved mix from digital? And could it eventually be justified to maybe enhance some disclosure around the materiality of digital to your results? 
Jeff Miller: Well, it’s certainly digital enhancing our margins. But that’s – and that’s certainly where we want to see that go and we expect it to continue. It’s also baked into all aspects of our business. So, from a digital perspective, it is sort of equal parts, customer-oriented by just consulting and software sales. It’s also equal parts making our tools better, so they become answer products and we sell them through the normal course of business, but they meaningfully impact the value of those tools.  And then finally, what it does internally to drive our own cost down and so helping, yes, but I think more importantly, when I look at D&E is again back to that baseline of improving margins, which is built on the back of sort of the iCruise performance and technology there - wireline performance and technology there. So, those kinds of things that are operational. We can see them. We see them getting traction, more broad traction. Those are the kinds of things that as we look into a multi-year upcycle internationally, that’s what’s going to drive margin up 2021, 2022, 2023. 
Sean Meakim : Really helpful. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ian Macpherson with Simmons. 
Ian Macpherson : Thanks, good morning guys. Jeff, I wanted to ask you for an update on your innovative frac operations. You spoke interestingly last quarter about the SmartFleet as well as we’ve seen what you’ve accomplished with the grid fracking.  I know there has been some IP contest there. I don’t – we don’t need to talk about that, but just kind of an update on how those operations on leading edge technology in domestic frac are going? And how you see that blossoming over the course of the year with incremental fleets of those varieties?
Jeff Miller: Yes, look, I really like the technology. I like what we’ve done. The smart fleet is as advertised. We got more trials to do. But we continue to find more effective ways to deliver that solution which should allow it to scale even more quickly. I think it’s going to continue to gain a lot of traction, very capital-efficient approach to implementing technology, because it implements with the equipment that we have.  From an e-fleet standpoint, again, certainly pleased with the performance that we’ve seen. Yes, it continues to drive or deliver on the kinds of efficiencies we probably would see both for us in terms of utilization and dollars per horsepower. Lot of interest from customers around that technology also. But just remember we are maximizing value in North America. So we only put this equipment out when it meets our return expectations and we can do this – the time horizon. And so, it’s not – it’s going to look more like replacement of upgrading replacements as opposed to sort of new investment. 
Ian Macpherson : Understood. Thanks, Jeff. And then, separately, Lance, I want to ask you about the free cash flow progression going into Q2 and for the rest year. Obviously, the CapEx was light loaded in Q1. And so, just thoughts on how the CapEx sequences through the year? And just general, maybe a refresh on total absolute dollar working capital framework for this year – no, sorry, not working capital, but bottom-line free cash?
Lance Loeffler: Yes, no. Good question Ian. Look, I think, overall, as everyone knows, maximizing free cash flow remains the key priority for us and what we are focused on. But more so, free cash flow is driven by margin progression and then all aspects of the capital efficiency. I know, Jeff covered a little bit in his prepared remarks around efficiency and working capital and remaining disciplined around CapEx.  Look, more operating profit we see ahead based on our activity outlook improving and obviously the progression around margins that we’ve discussed already this morning, we are pretty optimistic about what all of that means for 2021 free cash flow target, which today gives us more confidence that we will be sort of ahead of where consensus sits today even excluding the change in the metric that we’ve outlined this quarter. 
Ian Macpherson : Perfect. Thanks, Lance. 
Lance Loeffler: You bet, Ian. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. 
Chase Mulvehill : Hey. Good morning, everybody. 
Jeff Miller: Hey. Good morning, Chase.
Chase Mulvehill : Hey Jeff and Lance. So, I guess, in your prepared remarks, you talked about a doubling of the value of submitted bids across the international market we compare that to what you saw last year. So, I guess, I was hoping that maybe you could provide a little color relative to the mix between NOC, IOCs, independent E&Ps and maybe the regions that you see the most pick up in bidding activity.  And then, I don’t know if you’d be willing to kind of step out or squeeze a little bit and so, what it might would mean for activity as we kind of get into 2022 if you start signing a lot of these contracts. And so, I know you talked about some continued growth and some strong growth on the international side over the medium-term. But I don’t know if you’d like to quantify that at this point just given the bid activity you are seeing. 
Jeff Miller: Yes, look, I think that the type of activity we are seeing is probably more weighted towards Middle East, Latin America, broadly in terms of tender activity. I think that I am not going to try to quantify things that are two derivatives, kind of deviations in the future, but what our view is, that’s certainly indicative of a growing market and a kind of market that will grow over time.  We are going to engage in that and participate in it, but at the end – and be successful. But our view is, A. focus on profitable growth and drive international revenue growth that way, but I think we are also going to see that sort of lead to the broader based kind of recovery which is equally important to price and so that bring that up is to say that these big tenders are always very competitive from a price standpoint.  But where we start to see price improvement typically is as the market sort of starts to fill up, then we see more opportunities and that is how we see the international market shaping up. So, I think that’s an equally important concept to what we are seeing in terms of growth. 
Chase Mulvehill : Okay. Thanks for the color there. And maybe I can kind of come back to the conversation around U.S. onshore and try to tease out a little bit more in the publics versus privates. I don’t know if you’d be kind of willing to share your mix of publics versus privates in the U.S. onshore.  I know, kind of overall rig activity is roughly half between the publics and privates today and it continues to kind of see a shift towards privates as activity continues to rebound because they are obviously responding to a high oil price while the publics are not.  So, maybe just talk to your mix and kind of what advantages you think you have when you look to kind of pursue more opportunities on the private side versus your competitors? 
Jeff Miller: Look, we have a great footprint in North America. We’ve got a leading position in North America, which means we really work for all of the customers in North America. So, from a mix perspective, what we look for is efficiency. We look for opportunity. We look for growth opportunity and we look for uptake on technology and performance.  And so, I think the – that’s the way we view the market less around, A versus B, but it’s more do they have the characteristics that allow us to drive our value proposition in market and maximize the kind of returns like we are talking about. And so, I think that, that moves in different times depending on where the market is, but it doesn’t easily change a whole lot. 
Chase Mulvehill : Okay. I’ll turn it back over. Thanks, Jeff. 
Jeff Miller: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen.
Marc Bianchi : Thank you. I guess, thinking about the cost structure going forward, there are few variables I think with COVID normalization hopefully coming out of COVID where, maybe there could be some increased travel and entertainment expense. I am curious how that sort of factors into the margin outlook that you have and if there is any risk to maybe a headwind to margin as we get into the back half of the year?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. Look, those types of costs are in our outlook. So, I don't – we manage cost all of the time. I don't see a bow wave of that coming back. We've reset the earnings. We reset it in terms of how we work and how we move people around and how we go to market. So, look forward to the market opening. I think that's going to drive a lot more demand that will continue to drive demand for oil. But I think from – from our standpoint, we're going to – we just manage those costs.
Marc Bianchi : Yes. Thanks for that, Jeff. And Lance, back on the free cash flow, working cap was a positive number this quarter, but then there was another sort of 250 drag or outflow from other operating outflows. Could you talk about that? And then, just as I think about those two lines over the course of the year, would you expect them to be net neutral, positive, negative?
Lance Loeffler : Yes. So, other operating in the cash flow line item tends to be pretty heavy in the first quarter. We've got compensation that tends to hit in the first quarter, as well as, taxes are heavy with property taxes, et cetera. And so, that's not atypical from us from a, intra-year cyclicality perspective. We expect that to lighten up obviously into Q, but that's – that's sort of the color I would give you on that.
Marc Bianchi : Okay. Thanks for that. I'll turn it back.
Lance Loeffler : Thanks. Thanks, Marc.
Marc Bianchi : Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.
Connor Lynagh : Yes. Thank you. I was hoping we could put a finer point on some of the discussion on pricing in international. You made the comment that obviously large tenders will be competitive, but leading edge pricing should increase. Can you maybe frame for us the extent to which leading edge pricing is meaningfully different from what you're more sort of contracts book looks like? In other words, if leading edge pricing is moving higher would that imply that contract pricing will follow? Or is there a market-to-market impact we should talk about?
Jeff Miller: No, I think contract pricing will follow is the way that works generally. It starts there. The contracts themselves improve over time and I think that having alternatives that are higher priced also helped to create pressure – upward pressure on pricing even in large contracts.
Lance Loeffler : And I would add. I mean, that's what Jeff is describing is exactly what we were seeing in the early part or late part of 2019 and 2020 was that dynamic in terms of large tenders still bid competitively. But rising level of activity was tightening the rest of the broader market. Obviously, we took a pause with COVID, but we expect as we see activity levels creep back to where we were in those – at that period of time, I think we are optimistic that we start to see the same behavior from a pricing perspective.
Connor Lynagh : Got it. It makes sense. And I guess, just further to that, so on the large tender side of things, there has been some discussion about some of the softer elements maybe improving before pricing. How do you, guys feel about the potential for terms and conditions or different types of ancillary charges improving in the near term?  And I guess, the other question is, you've made a lot of changes to your cost structure. Do you think you can maybe drive improved margins without the increase in pricing?
Jeff Miller: Yes, we expect to do that and that's as we continue to see activity come on we will see improving margins. Always working on T's and C's. There are always leading edge sort of things that we are working on that they come easier to do become very important overtime to do. We are doing those all of the time and we are doing those now. Also, digital sort of implicit through all of this. So when you see our digital improving driving margins better all of the time. And so, I think, we should see improving margins before we see even the pricing, but I think the pricing, that's what allows us to really that's where we see the real traction and incrementals.
Connor Lynagh : Appreciate the color. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Voie with Wells Fargo.
Chris Voie: Thanks. Good morning. Just want to ask first on some of the cost inflation that was mentioned in the prepared remarks. Is that mostly getting offset in the pretty near-term maybe this quarter next? Or is there any impacts that could be flowing through as you get price recovery in the second and third quarter? Just curious if there is going to any tailwind from that?
Lance Loeffler : Yes, Chris. This is Lance. Yes, I mean, a lot of that’s largely, the cost of inflation that we describe is driven by what's happening in North America and the growth that we are seeing there. Some of it was driven by the impact of the storms, right and some of the shortages that we saw across the value chain. But I would say, look, our size and scale gives us an inherent advantage to negotiate the best deals in a lot of those consumables.  And to the extent a lot of our commercial arrangements allow us to pass that through to the customer. Our guidance overall sort of incorporates that. And I think, look, we are always going to be continuing to focus on maximizing our value in North America regardless of the challenges in the environment. But that’s sort of baked into how we see at least, the near-term playing out and obviously the outlook we've given the year.
Chris Voie: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, maybe on CapEx. So, I think in the past you said 5% to 6% range. In the data it looks like service intensity is very high. Pricing has not really caught up with the amount of work that’s getting done. So just curious to check in on the 5% to 6% range. If you expect that would still be in place for 2021 and probably 2022 as well.
Jeff Miller: Yes. Yes. I mean, that's what we talk about capital efficiency and driving capital efficiency through all parts of our business. That's what allows us to get to that 5% to 6% of revenues in terms of CapEx spend. So yes, for 2021 and 2022.
Chris Voie: Perfect. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: Thanks.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Okay. Thank you, Liz. Before we end the call, I'd like to make a few closing comments. I am encouraged by this year's positive momentum and demand recovery. We are well positioned globally for growing international demand. The expected steady activity cadence in North America and with our leading digital technologies, which allow us to maximize value for Halliburton and its shareholders. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.  Liz, please close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-01-19 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Halliburton’s Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments and other charges. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter earnings release and can also be found in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who maybe in the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Abu, and good morning everyone. Let me start by looking back at the year that just ended. 2020 was a year like no other. We faced a global pandemic, record oil demand destruction, and an unprecedented downturn in the energy industry. Despite these turbulent times, Halliburton demonstrated resilience and performed consistently with our execution culture. Before we get to our results, I want to address our outstanding employees. I thank you for your hard work and execution throughout the entire year. You answered the call for safety, collaboration, and service quality and delivered for Halliburton’s customers and our shareholders. Now, I want to highlight a few of our 2020 accomplishments. We delivered historic bests in all of our key safety and service quality metrics, recordable injury rate, lost time injury rate, vehicle incident rate, environmental recordable rate, and non-productive time. Each of these key metrics improved by over 20% and most did so for the second year in a row. This was a result of our employees’ continued commitment to safety and process execution despite the year’s distractions. Total company revenue of $14.4 billion outperformed the global rig count decline of 38% demonstrating the strength and diversity of our business. Our swift and decisive cost actions and service delivery improvements reset our earnings power, allowing us to deliver resilient margin performance. Our completion and production division finished the year with close to 16% operating margins, exiting the year higher than where they started. These results highlight the success of our structural cost reductions and process improvements. Our drilling and evaluation division had a strong, full-year margin performance despite the rig count declines experienced in all regions. We delivered over $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the year, demonstrating our ability to generate strong free cash flow throughout different business environments. We increased the breadth and depth of our digital offerings and delivered best-in-class performance across the spectrum of digital technologies, and we successfully launched Halliburton Labs, a collaborative environment where entrepreneurs, academics, investors, and industrial labs come together to advance cleaner, affordable energy. Now, let me share a few points about our fourth quarter performance. We finished the quarter with total company revenue of $3.2 billion, a 9% sequential increase and adjusted operating income of $350 million, an increase of 27% sequentially. This marks the first quarterly revenue increase since the activity declines began last March. Our completion and production division revenue increased 15% sequentially, while operating income improved 33% resulting in an operating margin improvement of 2% over the prior quarter. Our drilling and evaluation division revenue and operating income grew 2% and 11% respectively. Higher rig activity in the Western Hemisphere was offset by rig count declines in the Eastern Hemisphere. International revenue remained flat sequentially. Activity in Latin America improved for the second quarter in a row. Activity declines continued in other regions, but at a slower pace compared to the prior quarters. And lastly, our North America revenue increased 26% sequentially, driven primarily by increases in both drilling and completions activity in U.S. lands. Our overall strong performance was a direct result of our focus on the key strategic priorities that define Halliburton’s path now and into the future. We are focused on profitable growth in our strong international franchise, and we are driving strategic changes in North America and building a leaner and more profitable business. We are accelerating the deployment and integration of digital technologies both internally and with our customers. We are driving capital efficiency by advancing our technologies and making strategic choices that lower our CapEx profile, and we are an active participant in advancing a sustainable energy future. As we start the new year, we believe that the worst is behind us and look to the future with optimism. Oil prices are back to pre-pandemic levels driven by global vaccine distribution and unfolding demand recovery, OPEC+ discipline, and a declining production base. However, some caution is appropriate due to the surge in COVID-19 infections globally and the expected gradual return of spare production capacity. Our five strategic priorities will continue to drive Halliburton’s success as markets around the world stabilize and start to grow. We believe that aligning our actions with these priorities will boost our returns and free cash flow generation both today and as the recovery unfolds. We set these priorities according to our long-term view of the market. As oil demand recovers, we expect to see favorable market dynamics and the beginning of a multiyear energy up-cycle. However, we believe this recovery will look different than prior cycles. International short cycle producers will have an opportunity to gain share. North American E&Ps will increase spending from current levels that will take a more disciplined approach to growing production in the future. We believe that the overall cost and environmental impact of producing oil and gas will continue to decline due to innovation and technology adoption. As a result, oil and gas will remain a critical and significant component of the energy mix. I expect that our gains achieved in 2020, including service delivery improvements, structural cost reductions, and capital efficiency are firmly in place and sustainable. Halliburton is uniquely positioned in all markets and is prepared to deliver on both our customer expectations and our shareholder objectives. Our strong international business outperformed the market. Our full year international revenue declined 17%, while rig counts and customer spending were down more than 20%. All regions except Latin America declined in the fourth quarter, but at a slower pace. In the first quarter, we expect international activity to be impacted by typical weather-related seasonality and the absence of year-end product sales. Activity should bottom during the first quarter and improve as the year unfolds. For the full year, we expect activity recover very widely across regions. Latin America will continue with upward momentum off a very low bottom both onshore and offshore. Asia-Pacific is also showing signs of activity improvement. We believe parts of Europe and West Africa will remain slow, especially in the deepwater areas. As for the Middle East and Russia, we believe they will manage activity based on expectations of the economic and demand recovery. While the pace of recovery depends on the trajectory of demand improvement, we believe the second half of this year could see a low double-digit increase in international activity year-on-year. Halliburton is well positioned to benefit from this increase. Let me be clear, our target is profitable growth. Against a tough activity backdrop in 2020, we remained focused on increasing profitability and our actions resulted in overall international margin improvement. In 2021, we expect that several factors will continue to drive Halliburton’s profitable international growth, Halliburton will benefit from our improved position in the international market cycle. We are stronger, technically, geographically and organizationally. We have exposure to mature fields, completions and interventions work, a deck of resilient integrated contracts around the world, leveraged to unconventional developments in Latin America and the Middle East and a leading position in key active offshore areas. While the international sales cycle tends to be longer, we now have line of sight to activity increases in the coming quarters. Tender activity has picked up recently led by the NOCs in the Middle East and Latin America and new opportunities are emerging with operators in other regions. Our customers have also pulled forward mobilization plans for various contracts awarded to Halliburton that were put on hold due to the pandemic. Our new drilling technologies are penetrating the market and gaining customer confidence. For example, we exited the year with a threefold increase in our EarthStar deep resistivity sensor revenue. As activity recovers, our technology provides us with a tremendous opportunity to profitably grow revenue. We see significant growth potential in the continued international expansion of our production businesses, especially in mature fields around the world. For example, the international artificial lift market tends to be more resilient and as longer cycle. Once an operator puts its field on the specific form of lift, it typically stays on it for many years. We are currently mobilizing for our first multiyear electric submersible pump contract in the Middle East and are excited about the opportunities artificial lift opens for us in the region. The construction of our specialty chemicals plant in Saudi Arabia continues to progress towards final completion. When it is complete, Halliburton will have a differentiated value chain in the region that maximizes local content, delivers customized solutions more quickly and shortens customer lead times. I am excited about these two new additions to our international portfolio that provide us with unique growth opportunities. Finally, adoption of Halliburton’s digital solutions helps our customers to reduce cost per barrel, improve project economics and increase efficiencies. Our Halliburton 4.0 digital offerings in subsurface, well construction and reservoir and production create differentiation and margin growth opportunities for Halliburton. We are pleased that in 2021 several international oil companies are deploying DecisionSpace 365 cloud applications to streamline and automate their well construction activities. I believe that digital and other technology advances, geographic expansion of our products and services, along with continued discipline in cost management and capital efficiency should allow Halliburton to continue delivering profitable returns driven growth in the international markets. Turning to North America, the strategic actions we took last year reset Halliburton’s earnings power in this critical, but structurally smaller market. We are the leader in North America and the only integrated oilfield services companies still active in the hydraulic fracturing market. In the fourth quarter, our North America business took advantage of the recovery in completions and drilling activity and delivered continued margin improvement even without improved pricing. Completion stage counts increased in the oil basins, but declined modestly in the gas plays. While the U.S. land rig count recovered from its August 2020 low of 230 rigs, it is still 60% below the pre-pandemic levels. Private and small operators added the most rigs, while large E&Ps and majors moved more slowly. We expect completions activity in North America to continue improving in the first half of 2021 as commodity prices remained supportive and customers complete their backlog of DUCs. Customer consolidation will likely continue and we expect most operators will remain committed to a disciplined capital program. For the full year, provided that the impact of the pandemic moderates, economic activity continues to increase and oil price remains solid. I am optimistic that our customers will sustain activity in order to hold their production flat to 2020 exit levels with completion spend outpacing drilling. I am excited about Halliburton’s future in North America and here is why. We completed the most aggressive set of structural cost reductions in our history, giving us meaningful operating leverage in a recovering market. We also made significant changes to our processes that drive higher contribution margin, for example, how we perform equipment maintenance and provide engineering support. We believe the benefits of these changes will have a meaningful impact on our margins as activity picks up. The hydraulic fracturing market structure continues to improve. Utilization of our active equipment is higher than it was at the beginning of last year. The market has continued to rationalize and consolidate. We are seeing competitors either cannibalize idle equipment for parts or use it to beef up working fleets thus increasing average horsepower per fleet. This will make equipment reactivation to meet growing demand a lot harder for capital constrained companies and should only accelerate supply and demand balancing. As activity starts to increase, Halliburton has a unique competitive advantage and sufficient capacity to respond without adding incremental capital. Our in-house engineering capabilities to refurbish maintain and continuously improve our fracturing and perforating equipment minimize the cost and time to deliver the necessary equipment to our customers and take advantage of the market recovery. We are also well positioned to profitably grow in our competitive non-hydraulic fracturing businesses in North America. For example, in 2020, our artificial lift business developed and implemented new digital capabilities, increased remote operations jobs, and solidified its strong market position in North America. We also expect our well construction technology investments to best position Halliburton to outperform as drilling rigs return. Using the Halliburton 4.0 digital framework, we continue to collaborate and engineer solutions that maximize our customer’s asset value. Last quarter, we launched our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system and successfully completed a customer engagement in West Texas. SmartFleet is an industry first, where intelligent automation manages and executes live treatment decisions to optimize subsurface fracture outcomes. By using SmartFleet, the operator was able to consistently visualize and measure fracture propagation and control fracture placement through automation. Importantly, the system provided a level of subsurface control that was previously not possible and enabled the customer to actively drive their completion outcomes in real time. We are building on this success with multiple customer commitments across different basins. I believe this is the biggest step forward in fracturing technology in a long time. Let me give you a few more examples of how we are accelerating Halliburton 4.0 digital adoption. In the North Sea, we have successfully delivered the first fully automated cement job for the offshore cementing unit executed the work without human intervention. This is an important milestone in reaching the vision of fully autonomous offshore well construction that has significant implications for efficiency, safety and operating costs. In 2020, we more than tripled the number of DecisionSpace 365 users on the iEnergy cloud platform. Our customers also increased adoption of the DecisionSpace 365 asset simulator. Operators in Europe, Latin America and Asia ran over 3,000 reservoir simulation scenarios on the iEnergy cloud with speeds of up to 7x faster than with conventional on-premise simulators. Finally, we are teaming up with Accenture to drive the digital transformation of our supply chain. This will result in process efficiencies across large volumes of transactional activities, lower our overall cost, and free up resources to drive strategic decision-making and support of our operational requirements. Next, I want to discuss capital efficiency, a key enabler of our other strategic priorities, leveraging new materials and design approaches as well as digital innovation. We have been able to significantly reduce CapEx requirements and extend the life of our equipment. We are continuing our iCruise drilling system deployment and are reaping the benefits of a reduced CapEx profile and higher asset velocity. Technology advancements in multiple product service lines in both divisions are allowing us to improve design and service configuration to save time and money both for our customers and Halliburton. Finally, I would like to highlight several important actions we took in alignment with our strategic priority to participate in advancing a sustainable energy future. We are working to reduce the carbon footprint and environmental impact of our own operations and have committed to setting targets through the science-based targets initiative to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. With this commitment, Halliburton joins over 1,000 global companies taking science-based climate action. This is important in our journey to align with the latest climate science and contribute to sustainable energy advancement. We are also collaborating with our customers to produce oil and gas more efficiently, while reducing their emissions. We are currently performing the first electric grid powered fracturing operation for Cimarex Energy in the Permian Basin. With over 300 stages on multiple wells already completed, Halliburton’s electric-powered equipment has allowed the customer to achieve pump rates that were 30% to 40% higher than conventional pumps by utilizing the maximum grid power potential. Grid-powered electric spreads require substantially less capital, a smaller footprint and are more efficient compared to turbine power. When demand for emission reduction solutions translates to better pricing, I expect we will replace within our planned capital budget some of our conventional fracturing capacity with electric over the course of a normal equipment replacement cycle. Halliburton is starting the new year with a clear sense of purpose. We believe that our strategic priorities are the right ones and our margins in the fourth quarter demonstrated that. We are confident that the actions we have taken are sustainable and we are well-positioned both internationally and in North America for the unfolding market recovery. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Lance?
Lance Loeffler: Thank you, Jeff. Let’s begin this morning with an overview of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion, an increase of 9% and adjusted operating income was $350 million, an increase of 27%. During the fourth quarter, we recognized approximately $450 million of pre-tax impairments and other charges primarily related to the fair value adjustment of our real estate assets in North America. As part of our 2020 structural cost reduction initiatives, we reduced the amount of real estate required to run our business. In the second quarter, we decreased our real estate use in North America by roughly 50% by closing, selling, consolidating and reducing the size of many facilities. Subsequently, we conducted a detailed analysis on how we own, lease and operate our remaining real estate footprint. As a result, we concluded that a structured transaction is likely to be advantageous in managing the majority of our North American real estate, which led to the fair value adjustment I just discussed. This initiative is consistent with our strategic priority to achieve capital efficiency in our business, while allowing us to retain flexibility and drive future operating benefits. Let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail. In our completion and production division, revenue increased $236 million or 15%, while operating income increased $70 million, an increase of 33%. These increases were driven by higher activity in multiple product service lines in North America, increased stimulation activity in Argentina and Kuwait, higher completion tool sales in Africa, Southeast Asia and Norway, and increased well intervention services internationally. These increases were partially offset by lower pressure pumping activity in Saudi Arabia and lower completion tool sales in Eurasia and Australia. Our drilling and evaluation revenue increased $26 million or 2%, while operating income grew by $12 million, or an 11% increase. These increases were primarily due to higher drilling related services in North America and Brazil, increased wireline activity in North America and Latin America as well as higher fluid sales in Asia-Pacific and Guyana and increased software sales across all regions. Partially offsetting these increases were lower drilling-related services and project management activity in Europe/Africa/CIS, the Middle East and Mexico as well as reduced wireline activity in Asia-Pacific and Saudi Arabia. Moving on to our geographical results, in North America, revenue increased $254 million, a 26% increase. These results were driven by higher activity in stimulation and artificial lift in U.S. land as well as higher well construction and wireline services activity and year end completion tools and software sales. Latin America revenue grew $46 million or 12%, resulting primarily from increased pressure pumping and wireline activity in Argentina and activity increases in multiple product service lines in Colombia and Ecuador as well as higher fluid sales in Guyana and drilling services in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by reduced activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue was modestly down by $7 million or a decrease of 1%, resulting primarily from reduced drilling related services and completion tool sales in Eurasia, coupled with lower drilling related activity in Norway. These results were partially offset by higher completion tool sales in Africa, Norway and Continental Europe as well as increased stimulation and well intervention services in Algeria and Continental Europe. Middle East Asia revenue declined $31 million, or 3%, largely attributed to lower activity in multiple product service lines in Saudi Arabia, reduced drilling activity in United Arab Emirates and decreased project management activity in India. These decreases were partially offset by higher drilling-related services in China, Australia and Malaysia, increased stimulation activity in Kuwait, and higher software sales across the region. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $49 million and we expect it to be approximately the same in the first quarter of 2021. Net interest expense for the quarter was $125 million and should remain essentially flat in the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 19%. Based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2021 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. We generated approximately $638 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and delivered over $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the full year. As a result, we ended the year with approximately $2.6 billion in cash. We will continue to prioritize reducing leverage in the near-term and intend to pay down $685 million of debt coming due this year with cash on hand. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $218 million with our 2020 full year CapEx totaling approximately $730 million. In 2021, we intend to keep our capital expenditures relatively flat at $750 million. We believe that with this level of spend we will be well-equipped to take advantage of the unfolding recovery. Finally, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical, our results for the first quarter of 2021 will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end product sales, which primarily impact our international and Gulf of Mexico businesses. While we anticipate a slower than normal start to the year in some international regions, we also expect activity momentum in North America to continue with completions activity outpacing drilling activity. As such, in our completion and production division, we expect revenue to increase 3% to 5% sequentially and operating margins to decline 150 to 200 basis points largely due to a different business mix. In our drilling and evaluation division, we anticipate a low single-digit revenue increase sequentially, with operating margins expected to increase by 50 to 75 basis points. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Lance. To sum up, Halliburton is focused on executing our key strategic priorities to deliver industry leading returns and solid free cash flow for our shareholders. Our strong international business is expected to continue its profitable growth and market outperformance as the international activity ramps up throughout the year. In the critical North American market, our business is recovering and demonstrating margin improvement. Digital is gaining traction, growing our revenue and helping us and our customers increase operational efficiency and reduce costs. Our capital efficiency enabled by technology and service delivery improvements is expected to contribute to solid free cash flow generation and our commitment to a sustainable energy future will ensure we play a role in advancing cleaner and more affordable energy solutions. I am optimistic about the future. While the 2020 downturn was deeper and more widespread than anything we have seen before, I am encouraged by the changes we implemented to solidify Halliburton’s role in the unfolding economic recovery for oil and gas remains vital. Strong execution on our strategic priorities will allow Halliburton to continue to power into and win this recovery. And now, let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
James West: Hey, good morning, Jeff, Lance, Abu.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, James.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning.
James West: And well done in North America in reinventing yourself there and creating a much more valuable asset, and while it’s a structurally lower market or smaller market, you have created a nice cash flow machine there. Is it the – the question in my mind and you gave some color around this, Jeff, but I wanted to dig in a little further is the outlook for the full year ‘21. With North America, I know you mentioned -- you feel like the momentum is still good, but I guess first is there some peak that we are going to see or some stabilization of activity as the companies remain capital disciplined which should get back to kind of this maintenance level? And then on the international side, it sounds like you have called the bottom in 1Q, some pick up in 2Q, but the magnitude of the pickup in the second half, what’s your confidence level on that pickup?
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks, James. Let me start with North America and then start with – I am more optimistic today than I certainly was 90 days ago, and 2021 will feel better than the second half of 2020 annualized.
James West: Okay.
Jeff Miller: So what’s important is we see momentum coming into the year and it looks steady for the remainder and that’s predicated on customers, I think will be certainly rationale and capital disciplined, but I think there is also pressure to hold production flat in 2021, which creates a bit of a floor as we look at the full year.
James West: Okay.
Jeff Miller: From an international perspective, I feel confident around the international recovery. And I think in terms of magnitude into the second half of 2021, we believe or I believe we will be up low-double digits. So, that’s fairly solid and that’s based on the tender pipeline that we are seeing and the types of barrels that are produced shorter cycle, I think, will lend themselves to that type of uptick. And maybe one last word on international outlook, I mean, I think we view 2021 as a bit of a transition year. I mean, 2020 was the worst in our history, and we view 2022 as when we see the global rebalancing of supply and demand, which creates the sort of underpinning of a multi-year upcycle, and so that we see Q1 as a bottom and then steadily building from there. That’s the kind of momentum that we really like to see going into that supply and demand sort of coming into balance.
James West: Okay, okay. And then the tendering process internationally that’s occurring. Are these chunky projects with big rooms or is it more smaller or is it kind of ramping of projects that had maybe ramped downwards, ramping back up, what’s the kind of the nature of those tenders?
Jeff Miller: We are seeing some tenders, some big ones, also seeing some extensions of existing work. So, it’s a bit of a mixed bag at this point, but visibility we have are of not all chunky though. Again, I think the extensions are important also to create sort of that steady momentum that we are talking about.
James West: Right, okay. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, James.
Operator: Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Angie Sedita: Thanks. Good morning guys.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Angie.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, Angie.
Angie Sedita: Good morning. So Lance, maybe we can start with you and flesh out a little bit more commentary around the margin outlook for ‘21 for both C&P and D&E, and maybe you could start with 150 to 200 basis point decline on mix for Q1, flush that out for us and just talk about the full year? And then D&E, 8.2% in Q4, you set up slightly in Q1, can you talk about the margin outlook for the full year and the potential to return to a double-digit margin?
Lance Loeffler: Sure, sure, Angie. Look, I think it’s simply as it relates to the guide that we gave, it’s simply a business mix for C&P. So, we have got completion tool sales that are falling off and are being replaced. That revenue is being replaced by an improving North America market activity, but not the same level of profitability. But look, we are encouraged about some of the backlog that we see building in our completion tool business, and I think that also gives us the confidence that Jeff just outlined in terms of the back half of the year, particularly in the international markets. As you think about C&P margin progression in 2021, I mean, I would remind you and others on the call that we are starting from a much higher point in 2021 than we did even in 2020 before the impact of the pandemic, and that’s on a much lower activity level. On a full year basis, I would say, Angie, that our expectations are that we still drive mid-teens margins for our C&P division. And look, if we are able to get some pricing momentum, it could go higher than that. But we are happy with what we have done, particularly creating the operating leverage in the business. Jeff has mentioned several times that it’s sustainable. And I think it fundamentally drives higher incrementals, at least that’s what the management team here is focused on for this next upcycle. On D&E margins, again, I think we are starting 2021 higher sequentially, which is typically not the case for our business as we go through some of the seasonality issues that we have mentioned and year end software sales falling off. So, I am encouraged to see the momentum and margin progression across the end of the year and into the beginning of 2021. And that’s coming off again a largest rig drop in history for our business and our industry. Our expectation is to get to double-digit margins by the end of the year, end of the year 2021. And I think that we are ready to do that through capitalizing on obviously a recovering market that Jeff talked about in the back half of the year, but also on the technology and digital investments that we have made into the business throughout the course of 2020 and reaping the benefits in 2021. But I think the overall point, particularly for our D&E business as you think about the international markets is a real focus on profitable growth.
Angie Sedita: Yes, fair color. That’s great color, Lance. Very much appreciated. So, maybe one more separate follow-up on deep leads, maybe Jeff, you could talk about the technology that you have, how it differs from the peers the contract you have with Cimarex and then thoughts around additional construction and could electric fleets become a larger part of the operations over time?
Jeff Miller: Well, thanks, Angie. Look, I think that was – it’s an elegant and differentiated solution, but clearly a premium solution. We have been working on the electric technology for a number of years and have always described some of the challenges around electric also being the cost and the upfront capital associated with it. The grid solution actually eliminates the requirement for turbines, which have come with a range of either operating problems or emissions. And so – and it’s important to give a shout out to the Cimarex management team here, because a lot of innovation and collaboration together in order to bring together a very efficient solution and also one with the absolute lowest emissions, I mean, because now it’s tapped into the grid and consuming sort of a variety of different energy sources. So, the customer commitment was very important. I think customer interest will be high. But it’s also over time, but it’s also going to require pricing and different types of contract terms and I view this though as part of our normal reinvestment cycle. Clearly, there is interest, but we have a planned reinvestment cycle that’s inside of our capital budget and our outlook on capital efficiency and certainly see electric having a place in that, but that’s where it will sit.
Angie Sedita: Great. Thanks. I will turn it over.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Scott Gruber: Guys, good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Gruber: So Jeff, just staying on that same line of questioning, the demand for emission reduction solutions and frac appears pretty robust these days, with crude climbing above $50, do you think customers are going to be willing to pay up this year to begin a more material expansion of these solutions?
Jeff Miller: Well, we will have to see. Like I said, we have seen – haven’t seen it necessarily at this point, but I think that it’s part of an evolution. By that I mean, emissions are part of the cost of operating today. And in my prepared remarks, I indicated that I thought technology would lower operating costs and also emissions. And I think viewing it that way is going to be important. And beyond that, from a Halliburton perspective, we think about nutrition labels in effect, which help us work with our customers to lower the emissions not just for us, but in the services that we provide so that we can make choice and drive R&D towards what we think will be a lower emissions sort of footprint on location?
Scott Gruber: Got it. I mean, Lance just coming back to C&P margins, big question on Halliburton these days is just how C&P margins trend here given the recovery domestically, but have come in at a lower margin profile than international. Are you able to provide just a bit more color on the incrementals that you are seeing on the domestic side of C&P? You are not asking for the absolute level, but just in terms of the rate of change as activity comes back here, are you seeing that incrementals say in 4Q that approach there the segment average and those types of incremental sustainable into the first half of ‘21?
Lance Loeffler: Yes. I think look, incrementals will start off naturally slower when you are just working on activity ramp. Clearly, there is a lot more punch to incrementals when you start to get pricing as well. We are not there yet as you have heard us say on the pricing side, but I think our incrementals have been very healthy as it relates to just the activity improvement in North America. And again, it goes back to the things that we were doing around the structural cost initiatives to get the cost structure right in this market and to watch that business improve on activity alone has been good to see.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Lance Loeffler: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Sean Meakim: Thanks. Hey, good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Sean.
Sean Meakim: You hit your $1 billion free cash flow bogey for 2020 I am just curious how you think 2021 current flows who got moving parts as well as improving cash from operations as you go through the year, but also working capital needs shift as revenue is going to improve sequentially. CapEx you are expecting flat year-on-year, just how do we think about sending that mark for ‘21 in terms of what you all can achieve from a free cash flow perspective?
Jeff Miller: Well, Sean, let me take the first part of that, because it’s maximizing free cash flow is a priority of mine. And the strategic priorities that I have laid out are designed to deliver and maximize free cash flow, but as you say, I think the profile may look different this year. Lance, why don’t you go?
Lance Loeffler: Sure, sure. You are right, you are right, Sean. Yes, I think the free cash flow profile for 2021 versus 2020 will be much more from an operating profit perspective, right. So the full year of cost cut benefits will be rolling through 2021. We will also have the increased activity that you have heard us reference so far on the call. Yes, you are right, capital discipline and our philosophy around that remains in place, but as the business begins to grow, working capital will require investment, right as activity picks up. And so think about it outside of some of the noise that’s created from working capital movements. So excluding working capital for a second, I would expect free cash flow to more than double in 2021. Is that helpful?
Sean Meakim: Very helpful. Yes, thank you for that. And then on international markets, you talked about shorter cycle maybe taking back some share, I think that makes sense. And you noticed that tendering activity is picking up, can you just talk about expectations for bidding behavior between you and your competitors, how that may compare and contrast to what we saw in the most recent cycle? What should give investors confidence that tendering rounds may look different than what they did in the most recent round we saw, let’s say prior to the pandemic?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, Sean, I am not going to comment on the strategic and the competitive issues that you brought up. But what I can speak from our perspective is our focus is on profitable growth and profitable growth that maximizes free cash flow and drives returns. And I would say that, that’s been something that is important and we were making progress on that in the first quarter of 2020 in terms of improving margins and cash flow and returns and then we took a COVID pause internationally. Now, I don’t think dynamics have not changed in terms of available equipment for the international markets during the COVID period of time. So, with activity and our focus on profitable growth, I am encouraged by what I see, clearly, it’s always competitive. Certainly, it’s always competitive. But that focus on profitable growth is front and center with me.
Sean Meakim: I understand. Thanks very much for that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning, everyone. I guess so I wanted to come back to the conversation around kind of your E&P spending and then kind of your outlook for 2021. I don’t know if you can maybe just take a minute and talk to which your expectations are for North American E&P spending this year and then also on the international side, I know you said kind of activity up low double-digits in the back half of this year for international, but I don’t know if that means that we can actually kind of get more flattish spending this year by E&Ps or is that still going to be down?
Jeff Miller: Look, from an international standpoint, I mean, I think that’s a fairly tight range around flat. But I also think what’s more important is the improvement that we are seeing into what we believe is supply and demand balancing in 2022 and that’s the right kind of trajectory to have going into that. And so if we have got double-digit growth in the second half of the year, we have called the bottom in the first quarter of the year, we used to kind of work through that. And like I said, I believe that the tighter range around flat, but I think that’s going to be, it’s got to be the path to solid improvement. And I am pretty optimistic about how all of that plays out. In North America, again, I think Q1 last year creates a lot of noise in that comparison, but the important thing is I do believe customers will be capital disciplined, but we have got a lot of road to go just to get back to where we were, even pre-pandemic when the first quarter of ‘20. And so I think that and we saw production come off pretty hard in 2020. So, just to keep things flat in 2021, from a production perspective, requires a reasonable amount of activity and actually more activity than we even see today based on kind of our calculation and outlook, which gives me good confidence that while we have got good momentum in the first quarter and we have got pretty good visibility for the year. So, I think that our outlook that, that momentum it builds in the first quarter, but it doesn’t fall off at the pace that it has in the past certainly, I think that just because the drivers will be different. And I think capital discipline and flat production coexist in the market and that’s what gives me confidence.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. One quick follow-up, if you think about international pricing, we have heard some anecdotes from some people about some competitive pricing with some larger projects out there, but we don’t see all the data points. So I don’t know if you can maybe just take a second and just kind of talk about what you are seeing out there in the international pricing trend?
Jeff Miller: Well, what I would say is that it’s always competitive on big projects. We will see different behavior at different times. Yes, I think the under the most important thing is I think we are going into a multiyear cycle internationally and building profitable roads is what will be most important and certainly most important to Halliburton. And I say it that way, because the equipment availability hasn’t changed. Certainly, we do capital efficiency as one of our strategic priorities, which also means we want to put it to work where in the places where it’s going to make the best returns and that’s not going to be everywhere. That’s going to be in the best returning opportunities, but I think there is enough growth there. And again, it’s this multiyear cycle, it’s the balancing in ‘22 and the progression through ‘21 gives me confidence in certainly taking that approach.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. I will turn it back over. Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning everybody.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Kurt.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, thanks for that. Thanks for that great detail. Really appreciate it and always good to start the year on a positive tone and positive note, especially after what we have been through right over the last few years. So, it’s good to hear. Hey, just I wanted to follow-up with you in the context right on the international front since that’s been a point of focus on your messaging, you kind of gave the dynamics for the second half of the year, but when you talk about short cycle opportunity sets and short cycle projects kind of what regions and areas would that be geared to?
Jeff Miller: Yes, Kurt. I mean, I think that you look around the world and where are there either intervention opportunities or onshore type opportunities and offshore tiebacks, which that starts to lead us to, I would think, through the Middle East, that could certainly have application in Asia, the North Sea as well as another sort of important market that demonstrates those characteristics. So, I think it’s going to be fairly widespread in terms of where I think it’s the type of work and again, the short cycle type barrels of what require less capital upfront, they yield production more quickly, they demonstrate better returns for operators. And so – and I think that that’s where we will see more activity.
Kurt Hallead: Okay, that’s helpful. Appreciate that. And then I want to follow-up on your experience using highline power to run frac in the Permian. We have outlined some benefits of that highline power relative to turbine-driven e-frac. So, how do you see this evolving, right, Jeff? And what are some of the near-term opportunities for highline driven e-frac to accelerate and then what do you see as some of the roadblocks potentially to the adoption?
Jeff Miller: Well, the highline certainly, our grid-powered frac certainly is the lowest emission solution. Look, we learned a lot through the first project and so early days and still learning, but we have always said about electric that the capital upfront around power was going to be the sticky wicket and one that we were not willing to dive off and invest in, because from one day to the next, it’s not clear what’s most efficient. We actually knew all along that ultimately there would be a better both market for availability for power and also ultimately grid power. So, I think that there is a lot of collaboration that’s required. There is a fair amount of technology involved in solving for how to get power of where it needs to be. But I can – as I said in my remarks, it’s a very good solution to both a capital efficiency problem and an emissions problem. And I will look forward to seeing it catch on, so I don’t think it will be immediate, because it takes quite a bit of work upfront to get that all put in place and very much a commitment by the operator to stay the course.
Kurt Hallead: Got it. That’s great. I appreciate that color. I will leave it there. Thanks for the info.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from George O’Leary with Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is now open.
George O’Leary: Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Lance.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, George.
George O’Leary: Yes. Just to get insight into the North American completion services space and just curious clearly thus far, the increase in profitability has mostly been driven by top down actions on your part and then utilization increases. I wonder if you could speak to the supply demand dynamics, which you see in the market today and if there is any alignments made to greatly increases in midpoint this year or any frac spread count level that you guys are looking at that would you think the market may actually start to tighten up a bit and pricing can increase?
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks, George. Look, I think attrition has taken its toll. We certainly saw a lot of it visibly in 2020. And I think our view is or my view is that the supply and demand gap continues to tighten. I also think the market structure is improving. And so – and as we look forward from here just normal attrition or normal replacement probably runs 10% to 12%. So we have got that at a minimum in front of us. I also think that capital constraints are – the current market for capital and capital investment makes us a lot tougher for companies. And so harvesting and cannibalization of equipment that we saw in 2020, we also saw entire transactions predicated to a degree on harvesting equipment as part of that cycle, but all of those things are taking equipment out of the market. And so, could we see some tightening towards the end of 2021? I think so, particularly with kind of how our outlook on activity for the balance of the year, but I think this is – it will continue to tighten is our outlook.
George O’Leary: Okay, great. Very helpful color, Jeff. And then just digging through the game plan regarding the specialty chemicals business and you highlighted the plant [ph] inside clearly is a key part of the strategy, but just thinking bigger picture and longer term, what all do you guys need to execute on to dethrone one of the larger two players in that space, what’s left to do from here for you guys strategically to really grow that business?
Jeff Miller: Well, look, our view of that is we stay the course and we have got the infrastructure in place in the U.S., we have got what we are progressing to completion, the plant in the Middle East. But we are certainly encouraged about what we have done and our outlook, I am not going to try to predict market shares and those sorts of things. Look I like what we are doing and I am confident that what we are doing continues to improve and grow that business over time take a very long view of the chemicals business, has long sort of cycle times around tenders and awards and those sorts of things. So, but certainly all of the plumbing is getting in place now. And I am very encouraged about the outlook for that business particularly as it applies to mature fields and the kind of sustainable throughout the cycle type activity that it brings. George?
George O’Leary: Great. Thanks, guys. You have both my questions. Thank you very much.
Jeff Miller: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Liz. Before we end the call, I would like to make a few closing comments. Halliburton’s five strategic priorities are designed to deliver industry leading returns and to maximize free cash flow. Our strong international business is well-positioned with the right geographies, technologies and people to deliver profitable growth, while our North American business is recovering and demonstrating margin improvement. Halliburton’s market outlook, strategic priorities and execution culture make me optimistic about our future. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Liz, please close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for joining and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-19 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to Halliburton's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Abu Zeya: Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO, and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of severance and other charges. Additional details and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release and can also be found in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Abu. And Good morning, everyone. The third quarter saw world economy slowly emerge from lockdowns, oil prices move off their lows and the return of shut in production. Demand recovery is starting to unfold while under investment in global oil production capacity, OPEC+ actions and expectations for effective COVID-19 treatments are providing support to commodity prices. However, the pace and magnitude of recovery going forward will vary greatly by geography and customer type, with resurgence of COVID-19 in certain economies presenting near term risks.  Despite these challenges, we continue to execute on our value proposition both for our customers and our company. Every day, our employees collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers, and they're doing it with the best service quality and safety in our history.  Our third quarter financial performance reflects the results of this execution. Let me share some highlights. Total company revenue was about $3 billion, down 7%, and adjusted operating income was $275 million, an improvement of 17% compared to the second quarter of 2020.  Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 6% sequentially, while operating income improved 33%, delivering an operating margin improvement of 4% compared to the second quarter. These results demonstrate the impact of our structural cost reductions and improved utilization in North America land. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue and operating income were down 8% and 17% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2020. D&E's top line outperformed rig count declines both internationally and in the US. International revenue was down 7% sequentially as international rig count trended lower by 12%, highlighting the diversity and strength of our international franchise. North America revenue decreased 6% sequentially. Completions activity increases in North America land were more than offset by lower activity in the Gulf of Mexico and lower overall drilling activity as US rig counts declined 35% sequentially.  I'm pleased to report that our $1 billion in structural cost reductions are complete.  And lastly, we generated approximately $730 million of free cash flow through the first three quarters of this year and are on track to generate over $1 billion in free cash flow for the full year.  Before we discuss the details of our third quarter performance, I'd like to say something to our outstanding employees. I appreciate that the last several months have been far from easy. You have experienced disruption and uncertainty both in your personal and work lives. More than ever, you've had to balance taking care of yourselves and your families with your work duties. Through it all, you have performed admirably. You have continued to deliver outstanding products and services to our customers, breaking service quality and safety records along the way.  In April, no one would have predicted the operational and financial success that Halliburton has achieved over the last six months. You should realize these results are your results. They're due to your hard work and perseverance in very challenging times. I'm very proud of you all.  Halliburton is charting a fundamentally different course. We will continue to take strategic actions designed to boost our earnings power and free cash flow generation both today and as we power into and when the eventual recovery.  As markets around the world begin to stabilize, our five strategic priorities will drive Halliburton's future success. First, we continue to focus on our strong international business. We're outperforming in the international markets and plan to balance future growth with the objective of improving margins and returns.  Second, our strategic priority for a leaner, more profitable North American business is well underway as demonstrated by the last two quarters. We will continue to focus on profit, not share, in this more consolidated market, which will remain a key component of the global supply stack.  Third, digital drives everything we do. Our digital framework, Halliburton 4.0, permeates all aspects of our business and enables the success of our other strategic priorities. As digital deployment and integration across the value chain accelerates, we believe that we'll continue to grow our current business, create new revenue opportunities and drive better returns for Halliburton.  Fourth, our capital intensity is structurally lower, with future CapEx expected to be 5% to 6% of revenue. This provides a tailwind to our strong free cash flow generation.  Lastly, Halliburton is committed to a sustainable energy future in which oil and gas continues to play a critical role. On today's call, I will discuss how our third quarter financial performance reflects the impact of these strategic priorities and how our future actions align with them.  Our third quarter demonstrated again that we have a strong international business. It is delivering margin expansion now and we expect it to drive higher returns in the eventual recovery.  For the second quarter in a row, nearly two-thirds of our revenue came from international operations. And both our Drilling and Evaluation and Completion and Production divisions now earn the majority of their revenue in the international markets.  Our business mix and footprint in specific geographies, along with exposure to long-term integrated projects, support our comparative revenue outperformance and more constructive international outlook for 2020. We outperformed the 12% sequential international rig count declines in the third quarter and are trending significantly better than the 20% reported rig count reductions year to date.  Despite the well-known activity slowdowns, our international margins improved sequentially, with several key end markets demonstrating margin improvement year-on-year.  As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we see the pace of activity declines in the international markets slowing and believe we are getting closer to an activity bottom. In the meantime, service companies are being prudent with their capital, which results in limited access equipment. This should lead to a tighter market even without an increase in new activity.  While we believe a broader recovery across all regions will still take time, Halliburton is well positioned to outperform the market.  Here are a few examples. Over the last few years, we've made significant investments in our directional drilling and open hole wireline technologies that are critical to our success in the international markets. These investments are paying off. For example, this year in the eastern hemisphere, we've drilled 5.5 times more footage with our iCruise tools compared to last year despite the decline in rig activity.  Adding to our existing business lines, another important component of Halliburton's strength in the international markets is the ongoing expansion of our production businesses. Today, we have a small international market share in the service segment, which gives us plenty of room to grow. And we are growing.  I'm pleased to announce that, earlier this month, Halliburton was awarded a seven-year contract for electric submersible pumps by a Middle Eastern NOC. We also completed our first ESB installations in a growing geothermal market in Europe.  Halliburton 4.0 supercharges our already strong international business. We use open architecture and digital technologies that drive connectivity and deliver performance to collaborate with our customers and partners, pioneering new approaches to subsurface understanding, well construction and reservoir and production. Our digital innovation and its adoption by our customers are reframing operator project economics through greater efficiencies and improved decision-making. We believe this creates technological differentiation for us, and we expect it will drive higher returns.  Today, as more customers contract for integrated services packages, we continue to benefit from our strong project management capabilities that deliver efficiencies and reduce total cost of ownership for our customers.  Going forward, Halliburton Well Construction 4.0 will enable our project management business to deliver more efficient wells by reducing planning time, improving drilling performance, and lowering well construction costs and risks.  Well Construction 4.0 provides a singular interface for wellsite performance management. Its open architecture environment enables seamless integration and collaboration of our premium technologies, like Cerebro intelligent bits, LOGIX automated drilling software, and BaraLogix real time density and rheology with any third-party service or application. As part of Halliburton Production 4.0, we have formed a new alliance with Honeywell to use our digital technologies to optimize our customers assets like a manufacturing plant, fundamentally changing the way surface and subsurface are simultaneously managed. This helps our customers optimize their production. Halliburton delivers reservoir modeling, well and field surveillance, ESB optimization and well intervention. Honeywell brings its expertise and topside automation, surface equipment performance monitoring and productivity solutions. This is not simply an expectation for tomorrow. This is digital in action today for customers like PTTEP in Thailand.  Our current strengths and new capabilities in the international markets are critical to our future success. The international short cycle producers have an opportunity to regain market share as a result of declining US oil production. As demand starts to improve and outgrow supply, it should encourage international investments in both oil and gas. And our strong international business that now delivers the majority of our revenues is ready to power into the eventual recovery.  The next strategic priority I want to discuss today is driving a leaner, more profitable North America. Last quarter, I described to you in detail the actions we took to reset our earnings power in this key market. To recap, we now have 50% less structural headcount and a 50% smaller real estate footprint in North America compared to last year.  These and other changes to how we're organized and how we execute every day are sustainable and independent of market activity levels. I believe our efficient, disciplined execution in the North American market, together with these structural changes, will drive margin improvements and free cash flow.  Halliburton executed exceptionally well in North America this quarter. Our D&E division outperformed the sequential rig count declines and our C&P division grew and drove overall margin improvement for North America, despite the hurricane season negatively impacting Gulf of Mexico activity. This proves that our cost actions and service delivery process improvements are delivering the intended results.  As the leading completions provider in North America, Halliburton has exposure to every basin and every customer group. The month-on-month land completions activity improvement in the third quarter was a welcome sign. But September stage counts were still below April activity levels, and overall stages completed in US land showed a modest sequential increase for the full quarter. We intend to stay disciplined in how we deploy our fracturing fleets into the recovering market.  Looking ahead to the fourth quarter. We expect North America land completions activity to increase by double digit percentage as operators deplete their DUC inventory. We expect rig counts to lag completions and not step up materially before year-end.  As we predicted, the North America market structure is improving, with both consolidation and rationalization. We've seen a steady flow of consolidation announcements from operators as well as service companies. As I see it, the US shale industry will continue to slim down and, as a result, emerge healthier in a relatively more sustainable growth environment in the future. And this plays to Halliburton strength and our disciplined strategy.  The supply/demand balance for US fracturing capacity is also improving. We estimate that close to 30% of hydraulic fracturing equipment has been permanently retired this year. We expect more will follow as demand remains structurally lower.  Insufficient returns and a lack of reinvestment by service companies should accelerate the cannibalization of idle equipment for parts and the use of sideline pumps to beef up working fleets. We anticipate a tighter balance between horsepower supply and demand as the US achieves more stable production levels.  As we look ahead, we expect pricing to work its way through a couple of predictable steps. The first step, which we're starting to see now, is a recovering demand for active capacity. The first warm stack fleet reactivations are unlikely to see meaningful pricing improvement, but they will increase utilization and revenue on a lower cost base and make a positive contribution to earnings.  The second step will happen when activity recovers enough to call on cold stacked equipment to return to the market. I expect that higher pricing will be necessary to justify incremental investments.  As with our International business, Halliburton 4.0 is driving innovation in North America. Last week, for example, we announced an industry first, the launch of our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing system. SmartFleet marries our digital capabilities and fracturing expertise to do what was not possible until now, give customers control over frac performance in real time. The decisions our customers make about well spacing and multiple pad development have a big impact on their unconventional asset economics. With service efficiencies plateauing and capital remaining constrained, operators strive to make every stage as productive as possible.  Before SmartFleet, however, they faced a high level of uncertainty related to fracture placement and performance. SmartFleet changes this. Its intelligent automation integrates real time fracture measurements, live 3D visualization, and real time fracture commands to give operators control over fracture outcomes while pumping. It sets us apart from the rest of the hydraulic fracturing market and solidifies our industry leadership in intelligent fracturing.  SmartFleet and other Halliburton 4.0 digital offerings will continue to address our customers toughest reservoir challenges and improve the efficiency of our service delivery.  In the near term, I expect the divergence of rig and completions activity will create choppiness as balance sheets are repaired and reinvestment rates continue to adjust. However, we believe that our strategic priority for a leaner and more profitable North America will enable us to successfully navigate through this market contraction and power into the eventual recovery.  Let me now discuss capital efficiency, a key enabler of all our strategic priorities. We believe we can maintain our reduced CapEx at 5% to 6% of revenue, and that it will contribute to sustainable free cash flow generation for our business.  We will keep investing in the development of new technologies and strategically fund international growth as the market recovery unfolds. This includes digitalization of our tools and processes that together with material science and design advancements drive down cost and extend the life of our equipment. At the same time, we will continue to exercise thoughtful capital allocation to the best returns opportunities.  The last strategic priority I will discuss today is Halliburton's commitment to a sustainable energy future. We recognize that the energy landscape is evolving, and alternative energy sources are growing. We're executing our strategies to meet these changes.  First, oil and gas will play a key role in providing the world with affordable and reliable energy long into the future. And we will continue to deploy innovative solutions, including our full digital portfolio to meet that demand.  We will also invest in the future directly through innovation and our recently launched Halliburton Labs. Today, our digital and other technologies help our customers decarbonize their legacy production base and reach their emissions reduction goals.  For example, our digitally enabled iCruise rotary steerable system allows customers to drill wells faster and reduce the number of days a diesel powered rig is on their location, which helps cut down on emissions.  We also help our customers achieve their carbon neutral goals through carbon capture and storage. We provide a variety of services in this space, from subsurface assessment and characterization to well construction and fiber optics monitoring and verification solutions. Our current technology portfolio support CCS projects all around the world – in Australia, Europe and North America.  We also have decades of experience in providing geothermal drilling services. Halliburton delivers a full range of innovative technologies to address the ultra-high temperature environments, from directional drilling, cementing, fluids, pumping services, logging and casing inspection and project management led developments of geothermal fields. To date, we have participated in operations in all the key geothermal producing areas of the world.  For our own portfolio of services and equipment, we continue to do what we do best – innovate, collaborate and invest in lowering the emissions profile of our technologies. We have shown steady improvement over the years reducing our scope one and two emissions. In the coming months, we are committed to establishing and sharing our greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and reporting on our progress.  Finally, I'm excited about the formation of Halliburton Labs, which we announced in the third quarter. It is a collaborative environment where entrepreneurs, academics, investors, and industrial labs come together to advance cleaner, affordable energy. Halliburton receives a minor equity stake in early stage clean energy companies in exchange for their access to our early stage clean energy companies in exchange for their access to our world class facilities, technical expertise, and business network.  But more importantly, Halliburton labs provides us with a wealth of knowledge and an opportunity to play an important role in developing sustainable affordable energy solutions.  Were excited about Halliburton Labs advisory board consisting of leading academics and thought leaders, whose first members include Rice University's Reggie des Roches, Caltech's John Grotzinger and Tulane's Walter Isaacson.  I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Lance?
Lance Loeffler : Thank you, Jeff. Let's begin this morning with an overview of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was about $3 billion, representing a 7% decrease, and adjusted operating income was $275 million, or an increase of 17%. These results were primarily driven by continuing rig count declines across multiple regions, partially offset by increased activity in Latin America and higher completions activity in North America land as well as the continued impact of our global cost savings.  In the third quarter, we recognized $133 million of pretax severance and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. The cash component of this charge was approximately $80 million.  Let me cover some of the details related to our divisional results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue decreased $98 million or 6%, while operating income increased $53 million or 33%. The revenue decline was driven by reduced completion tool sales across Europe/Africa/CIS, the Gulf of Mexico, and Latin America, coupled with lower cementing activity in the Middle East, Asia and North America land. It was partially offset by higher stimulation activity and artificial lift sales in North America land, higher activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina, as well as increased pipeline services in Europe/Africa/CIS. Improvements related to stimulation activity in North America land and the impact of our cost reductions drove the overall margin increase.  In our Drilling and Evaluation, revenue decreased $123 million or 8%, while operating income decreased $22 million or 17%. These declines were primarily due to reduced drilling related and wireline services activity in North America and eastern hemisphere, coupled with lower project management activity in the Middle East Asia. They were partially offset by improved drilling activity in Latin America.  Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue decreased $65 million, or 6%. This decline was primarily driven by decreased well construction activity in US land, coupled with reduced activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by higher stimulation activity and artificial lift sales in US land.  In Latin America, revenue increased $34 million or 10%, resulting primarily from increased activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico, partially offset by reduced activity in Ecuador and lower completion tool sales in Guyana.  Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue decreased $42 million or 6%. This decline was primarily driven by lower completion tool sales across the region, reduced drilling related services in Norway, and a decline in fluids and cementing activity in Russia.  These reductions were partially offset by increased activity across multiple product service lines in Azerbaijan and a seasonal increase in pipeline services in Europe. In Middle East/Asia, revenue decreased $148 million or 13%, largely resulting from reduced well construction activity across the region, lower project management and wireline activity in the Middle East and decreased project management activity in India. These declines were partially offset by higher completion tool sales in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.  In the third quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $42 million, which was positively impacted by an insurance reimbursement. For the fourth quarter, we estimate that our corporate expense will return to previously announced run rate of $50 million.  Net interest expense for the quarter was $122 million, which included higher interest income from our international subsidiaries. We expect net interest expense closer to $128 million in the fourth quarter.  Our adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 24%. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 15% based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate should be approximately 21%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $155 million and we now expect full-year 2020 CapEx to be less than $800 million. Turning to cash flow, we generated $265 million in free cash flow during the third quarter, primarily driven by our increased operating income and continued working capital improvements. As a result, we improved our cash position during the third quarter ending the period with $2.1 billion in cash. We expect to continue generating positive cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter and expect to deliver full-year free cash flow of over $1b. Now, turning to our short-term operational outlook, let me provide you with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. For our Completion and Production division, we expect higher North America completions activity and traditional year-end completion tool sales which are more muted than in prior years. With that said, we expect revenue to be up approximately 10% and margins to remain flat sequentially. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate a slight sequential increase in our drilling related activity and expect to see typical year-end software sales. As such, revenue for the division should be up mid-single digits with operating margins moving modestly higher by 25 to 50 basis points. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?
Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. To sum up, we're charting a fundamentally different course. I believe our execution of the five key strategic priorities will deliver success for Halliburton now and into the future.  Our strong international business is already delivering returns and margin expansion and I expect that will continue in the next upcycle. Our leaner North America business will enable us to successfully navigate through the market contraction and will be more profitable as the market recovers. Halliburton 4.0 is part of everything we do and enables the success of the other strategic priorities. It will grow our current business, create new revenue opportunities and drive better returns. Our lower capital intensity is expected to contribute to strong free cash flow in the future. Our commitment to a sustainable energy future in which reliable and affordable oil and gas continues to play a critical role will help us and our customers lower emissions. Our creation of Halliburton Labs will accelerate the sustainable affordable energy future.  Halliburton's strategic actions boost our earnings power reset and free cash flow generation today and as we power into and win the eventual recovery. And now, let's open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. 
Angeline Sedita: Just on the pace of activity, maybe some thoughts around 2021. In the past, for the US markets, you talked about a strong start early 2021. And so, thoughts if that's really driven by the DUC cleanup or do you think we could see a pickup of drilling activity and additional wells? And then along with that, on the international side, you noted that the pace of decline is slowing. Do you think that we've seen the bottom in most of these countries? Is there some reason to believe that we have not even ignoring the seasonality and thoughts around the pace of the international activity in 2021?
Jeff Miller: Just broadly, both your questions, 2021 feels better from here. I think the second half of 2020, thinking about that as the bottom, we see progressive improvement in 2021. Separating that a little bit, North America, we're seeing DUC activity now. We'll see DUC activity I suspect into next year. And then, the drilling activity would follow that. But again, if we step back and think about North America, to maintain steady production, whatever the exit rate ends up being, implies the number of wells that need to be drilled. And so, if drilling is below that, then we start to see production drift lower, which then would have a positive impact on commodity price and an impact on – more so on international activity. From an international perspective, again, we see improvement in 2021 from where we are certainly now and we see that strengthening more so in the back half of 2021 or the second half of 2021 because we do work through seasonality and some other things.  But in either case, we see improving activity.
Angeline Sedita: And then if you could talk about operating margins in 2021, giving you all the full year benefit of the $1 billion in structural cost cutting and the activity outlook you just outlined, thoughts around the pace of C&P and D&E margins and even the potential exit rate for 2021?
Jeff Miller: Obviously, the earnings reset or the earnings power reset is a critical part of our strategy. So, those cost cuts are permanent. I expect when activity moves up, we'll see margin improvement follow. We'd see D&E margin start moving upwards when we see broader international drilling activity recover. As I've described, how we might see that next year. C&P is going to benefit from stronger completions activity recovery in North America and also internationally. So, I think C&P probably sees recovery more so first. And margins in D&E improves, gets into the double digit range as we see more sustained recovery internationally. So, again, really like where we are strategically. I think our strategy addresses that and would expect to see the margin progression follow along with the activity.
Operator: Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI.
James West: International, Jeff, and I know that – you spent most of your career working international. The business has contracted, of course, but sounds like you're seeing a bottoming here. What type of or what level of recovery would you expect in 2021 and are there geographies that stand out as more robust than others?
Jeff Miller: James, look, I think we went into the first part of this year very active. In fact, we were seeing a lot of good things happening in Q1 and it tailed off in Q2. So, I don't think the full year of 2021 eclipses 2020. But trajectory I think is really important because that leads to the eventual recovery that I believe happens. And so, I think we get on that pace starting in 2021? Does it overcome 2020 immediately? Not necessarily. But it's going to just be slightly below. I think we're on a pace because of the sort of under investment that we're seeing. And we're seeing it in the US today and we'll see it – we've seen it really internationally. And this is just too important to too many governments, to too many people in the world to see it under invested for that long.
James West: And as we think about the US market which is kind of an impaired market, but the structure is getting better with some of the M&A that's happening. Are you guys comfortable that you see a more profitable future as we kind of pull out of this downturn in North America than we've seen for the last almost a decade? 
Jeff Miller: Yes, I do. I think what we're seeing, service company consolidations is great for Halliburton. It's happening as we expected it would happen. And our approach to this market, which is a different playbook, we wouldn't be doing it if we weren't convinced that it drives better free cash flow and a more profitable market. And so, there are a lot of things that we're doing that are different that will allow us to make more free cash flow in this type of market. And so, I think all of these things are positive. And I would say whether it's consolidation and attrition and rationalization, all of those things are conspiring to create tightness. But even in spite of not having the tightness today, we're seeing the improving margins and returns. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons. 
William Herbert: Lance, free cash flow, and I'm just looking at the relationship between Street expectations for next year, EBITDA down 5%, 7%, but free cash flow down close to 40%. Does that make sense, given the fact that you're not going to have the restructuring and severance cash expense that you had this year. Maybe working capital is not the tailwind in 2021 that it was in 2020, but if revenues are flat to down, it's hardly a huge consumer of cash in your margins, and so I'm just curious, how do we think how should we think about free cash flow for 2021 at this stage. Your capital intensity, 5% to 6%. It would seem that your free cash flow would be actually up year-over-year. 
Lance Loeffler: I agree with a lot of the commentary in the questions, meaning that, yes, working capital will be less of a tailwind for our free cash flow next year, but that's replaced by healthier operating profit led by increased activity in the markets that you heard Jeff describe, also a full year benefit of the cost cutting activity that we've been through this year rippling through our operating margins. And so, it'll be much more of an operating-led free cash flow draw and in relationship to the capital intensity that we've talked about, as opposed to working capital unwind next year. 
William Herbert: In the event that EBITDA is relatively flat, do you think – flat, flat to down, flat to up, do you think that free cash flow is in the vicinity of this year or higher next year?  Look, I think it's a little early to call, Bill. But I think we've been pretty clear on what the levers are the drive it, and we'll be more prescriptive about it when we get into the course of next year. 
William Herbert: Jeff, I'm just curious as to your perspective here with regard to the consolidation that we're seeing, first Noble goes to Chevron, WPX goes to Devon, Concho goes to Conoco. And these are basically at stock prices that are 20% to 30% of recent peak. And I'm just curious, in your discussions with your clients and your customers, is the sense that this is a fundamentally disrupted industry and that basically, with regard to the lower 48 market opportunity, it's been fundamentally redefined, and at this juncture, the best alternative is define a relatively safe piece of paper in the form of a consolidator. What are you hearing from your customers? 
Jeff Miller: I think it's what you see when market efficiency start to come into play, in the sense that these larger operations allow for better application of D&A for all. There's just a lot of costs associated with operating all these different companies. And so, I suspect at some level there's the opportunity to better leverage and make more cash flow by bigger operators. I think the value you're seeing, obviously, the stock price is depressed, but nevertheless the outlook, the long-term outlook and the importance of that production is still very relevant. And so, in the discussions, I think that's more of what I hear, is around how to be more efficient. Obviously, this is one way to be more efficient. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.
Chase Mulvehill: I guess the first question I wanted to ask is about C&P guide. Lance, I think you guided up revenues 10% on a sequential basis. I guess, one, can you tell us how much benefit is coming from kind of year-end completion tool sales? And then number two, I would expect that margins would have been up given the strong sequential improvement in revenues. So, kind of help us connect the dots on why margins will be flat? 
Lance Loeffler: Well, I think, one, Chase, on your question about completion tools, I think we were clear even in the guidance language that completion tools will be more muted than they have been in recent fourth quarter just given the size of the market and level of activity.  In terms of the guide, I think you have a lots of puts and takes. We have an improving North America structure. But we also have, again, the sort of the muted impact of completion tools that have traditionally led to accretive margins impact in the fourth quarter. 
Chase Mulvehill: And if I can just talk more specifically about North America, I think Angie kind of asked about E&P CapEx. And obviously, it will be up from here. I don't think it was quite clear if you thought it would be up on a year-over-year basis. But maybe if we can just talk to kind of frac fleets and kind of where you think the active frac fleet count is today and when we'd get to that kind of 200 level that you guys talked about being kind of required to hold production flat. And then, any thoughts on when you think that rig activity will begin to meaningfully recover? 
Jeff Miller: I think with the activity in Q1, and offset by Q2, I think, overall, 2021 will be slightly down from 2020 in terms of overall. But, again, that's sort of factoring out Q1 and Q2 offsetting. So, let's take the second half of this year and project that forward. I think it feels better from here and we see sequential recovery.  I think it really comes down to where does production exit in 2021 will drive then how much activity in 2021. So, we can see a path to that in 2021 in terms of the 200 fleet sort of level. Again, it's going to depend on what is the appetite for producing barrels in North America inside of that time frame.  I think from an overall – when I think about the frac fleet, I also think about the health of the frac fleet for all of the market. And I think the pace of attrition is going to weigh on that, which means it could create more tightness sooner, even if we were somewhat below that. 
Chase Mulvehill: And then, what about rig activity, when do you think that starts to pick up meaningfully? 
Jeff Miller: Look, I think that follows the frac activity. So, I would expect we would see rig activity picking up middle of next year, probably middle of 2021 just because that sort of will follow probably the most frac intensity. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. 
Sean Meakim: So, Jeff, thinking about normalized margins, you reset the cost base this year. You've indicated you think both segments can generate normalized margins in the mid-teens in the next cycle. So, in 2015 through 2019, normalized margins were maybe 10%, 11%. But you're able to get to that mid-teens level in 2008 to 2014. So, it would be great if you could walk through the building blocks to those normalized expectations, particularly in D&E which I think seems to be a little more of a heavier lift from here.
Jeff Miller: I always talked about a lot of what we're doing in D&E in terms of our iCruise cruise technology, what we've done around other service lines in that business, whether it be wireline and even testing. And so, I think that the building blocks are around, A, getting that technology footprint implemented, which we're doing. I've described sort of the uptake that we've seen in that even in the current market. So then, sort of the next step from that is getting any amount of improved activity, which I believe we will see.  And then, in the international markets, the capital over supply is much less. In fact, capital was getting tight in Q1 of this year, and it remains tight. And so, I don't think it's – in fact, I think it's quite realistic to expect to see some pricing improvement, which is another key component of how we step those margins up. 
Sean Meakim: And that dovetails into – can you talk a little bit more about the international cycle? So, some of your IOC customers are committing to divert capital away from upstream oil and gas. Your independent customers are being forced by financial markets to commit more cash flow to their balance sheets. Seems like the next international cycle is going to be shorter cycle and more NOC focused. Is that fair, that long cycle maybe falls more out of favor in terms of mix of spend? And just how you think Halliburton is positioned for that type of environment.
Jeff Miller: Well, look, I think we're very well positioned for that kind of environment. A, we're in all of the right locations, we've got relationships with all of the customers you're describing. I think that what we're doing with project management and our investment in lift and chemicals, and those sort of things all play to that type of market even more so. And so, I think that's a place where we've been very successful in the past, and I think that that will ultimately be even a more stable market.  I think oil and gas is so important on so many dimensions that I believe that we'll see more investment, even by NOCs as we move forward into certain of these geographies anyway. But from a positioning perspective in the international markets, really like where we are and really like our technology footprint, and particularly for the kind of outlook you describe that informs our strategy actually, key elements of our five strategic pillars. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. 
Scott Gruber: Jeff, a couple of times in the call you highlighted your improving position abroad. Obviously, a number of interesting initiatives there and some good momentum. As we look out into 2021, if we think about things on an exit to exit basis, when the market is hopefully starting to grow again, not asking for your market growth outlook, but how much of a delta do you think you'll be able to deliver versus whatever the underlying market delivers next year, just given your initiatives? 
Jeff Miller: Look, I think if that's a top line question, I think we've had a history of outgrowing the market over the last several years, so we know how to grow. We're very much focused on driving profitable growth out of that market. And again, that's precisely what our strategy is intended to do. So, I'm certainly comfortable with our ability to outperform the market and from a growth perspective. Equally comfortable with our ability to drive profitable growth. But I think what you'll see us doing is driving those things that drive a capital efficiency. So, whether it's iCruise or it's digital or it's elements of our business that allow us to make more free cash flow out of that growth going forward. Again, like I said, very excited about how that all shapes up and what the team is working on. 
Scott Gruber: And then, a question on Hal Labs, a very interesting initiative. You highlighted several areas of additional expertise we have exposure to, energy transition theme, and where you have some ability to generate revenues. But as we step back and kind of look at the overall revenue opportunity for both you and peers, it seems somewhat small over the next 5 or 10 years with without a material investment and potentially opening some new revenue channels, how do you think about that potential balance? How do you think about allocating R&D dollars and CapEx dollars and potentially some M&A dollars to the transition theme while also trying to deliver better returns next cycle? And how do you think about when it's potentially time to ramp those investments up a little more aggressively? 
Jeff Miller: Yeah, I'm going to be really clear. We're an oilfield services company. And we believe the world needs a lot of oil and gas for a very long time. And really, to the extent capital is shifted away by certain customers, more capital will be invested by others.  But with that as a backdrop, clearly, Halliburton Labs is exciting for us. Let's be really clear how we're doing that. We are, in effect, exchanging our expertise and access to our labs and business network for an equity investment in early stage companies. So, our intent is not to invest capital dollars into that process today beyond what little support – in fact, not capital dollars. They're engaging in our – in effect, taking advantage of invested capital that we already have that we know we can take better advantage of doing this.  So, we'll have a front row seat in this space. We'll watch it closely. We have a lot of skills that are applicable to helping companies be successful in this space, and we'll learn a whole lot about this over time.  But I want to be clear, oilfield services is where we're spending our capital today. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC.
Kurt Hallead: I do want to actually extend the conversation a little bit more on that last topic, Jeff. I think as is painfully aware for everybody on this call, investors are definitely shifting their focus, at least in the very near term, toward more the renewable dynamic and clean energy dynamics. And it's good to see that you're going to have that front row seat through Halliburton Innovation Labs. I think we've also seen a number of the major oil companies that are customers of yours start to pivot their budget, some more so than others, like BP, for example, into more the renewable space. And then, I heard you quite clearly that you're an oil services company, and that's kind of where your capital is going to go.  But I'm kind of interested on kind of delving beyond those dynamics and getting into how you may be looking longer term through this process. Do you think the shift on renewable energy is just going to fizzle out, like it has been prior cycles, or do you actually see Halliburton playing a meaningful role in that dynamic and having it be a meaningful piece of the business and maybe having a third business line with Completion and Production and Drilling and Evaluation as part of the Halliburton portfolio in the future? 
Jeff Miller: I think that there will be the different forms of energy, renewable energy, alternative energy, they will all compete for space. And I believe oil and gas is very affordable and very effective. And it will be for a very long time. But that's not to say there won't be competitors in the space. Nuclear has been in the space a long time. And so, what I think from a Halliburton Labs perspective, it's looking at the disruption that happens, of which there will be much. But oil and gas remains very competitive in that kind of environment. So, I won't try to call, does it fizzle, does it make it. What it will have to do over the long term is compete and feel very good about oil and gas as a competitor. 
Kurt Hallead: And my follow-up then is just along the lines of more the traditional business dynamics. So, you guys referenced a tighter market for both North America and International going forward, the prospect to get margin improvement on the heels of higher activity, even without pricing. So, I was just wondering if you could help us frame that dynamic. In the context of prior cycles, you typically would get maybe incremental margins anywhere around 35% to maybe 50% with pricing power. Without the pricing power, with the cost savings and higher activity, how are you guys thinking about the prospect for incremental margins as we as we move off the second half of 2020 and go into 2021?
Lance Loeffler: Kurt, this is Lance. Look, I think everything that we've done around sort of the structural cost cutting exercise that we've been through this year in major form will also continue on the edges as we move forward. But it was all built to reset our cost structure in order to drive better incrementals going forward.  Now, look, clearly, activity helps on a lower fixed cost base. You'll see improvement, so I expect that just activity alone will help bolster or incrementals. But, clearly, if you add pricing on top of that, they are supercharged. I think a lot of what this management team on is looking to deliver outside incrementals even in this market in a recovery versus a historical. 
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. 
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Shannon. Before we wrap up today's call, I would like to leave you with a few closing comments. Our third quarter performance demonstrates tangible results of Halliburton's execution from our five strategic priorities and the early impact of our earnings power reset. Our strong international business is already delivering returns and margin expansion and I expect it will continue in the next up cycle.  Our leaner North America strategy will enable us to both navigate through the current market conditions and be more profitable as the market recovers.  Finally, our strategic actions boost our earnings power reset and free cash flow generation today and as we power into and win the eventual recovery.  I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Shannon, please close out the call. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Halliburton’s second quarter 2020 earnings call. Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Abu Zeya: Thank you Liz. Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton’s website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO, and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual result to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments and other charges. Additional details and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release and can also be found in the quarterly results and presentation section of our website.  After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now I’ll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you Abu, and good morning everyone. The second quarter of 2020 is now behind us. It was a tough one for many industries, including the oil and gas sector. A global pandemic and the resulting collapse in demand have upended many businesses, and as economies around the world emerge from lockdowns, the path forward remains uneven and uncertain.  I am grateful for our employees’ focus, dedication and perseverance during these difficult times. Employee safety is our top priority and we continue our efforts to take the appropriate measures to provide a safe working environment for everyone. COVID-19 is altering our everyday live and business operations, and it is important that we do not let our guard down. Despite this distraction, our safety performance is the best it has ever been with our total recordable incident rate improving more than 20% since the end of last year.  There are three key areas I will address on the call today: first, our solid second quarter performance, demonstrating a significant reset that improves the earnings power of our business despite the severity of the activity collapse; second, the market and business outlook for the second half and full year of 2020; and finally, what we are doing today to make sure that Halliburton powers into and wins the eventual recovery. The global activity collapse in the second quarter was swift and severe, much worse than anticipated. U.S. average rig count for the quarter declined 50% sequentially while international rigs dropped 22% with absolute global rig count sinking to the lowest level in recent history. Halliburton’s response to the market disruption was equally swift and aggressive. As I’ll discuss in a few minutes, our organization responded with a tremendous sense of urgency. Let me cover a few headlines related to our financial performance. Total company revenue was $3.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $236 million. Our completion and production division revenue of $1.7 billion was impacted by a drop in market activity in the low teens in international markets and about 70% in U.S. land completions. Despite these headwinds, C&P delivered a solid operating margin of 9.5% in the second quarter.  Our drilling and evaluation division revenue of $1.5 billion was down largely in line with lower rig count activity globally, delivering operating margin of 8.3% in the second quarter. The speed and effectiveness of the cost actions that we have executed helped minimize the sequential decremental margins to 14% in C&P and 16% in D&E.  Revenue for North America declined 57% sequentially with our C&P and D&E divisions outperforming the completions and drilling activity declines respectively. International revenue was down 17% sequentially, outperforming the rig count decline. Finally, we generated over $450 million in positive free cash flow in the second quarter. As reflected in these results, our aggressive cost actions are an important part of our earnings power reset. As you recall, we removed $300 million in costs over the prior two quarters. In April, we announced an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions. I’m pleased to report today that these actions, which are largely permanent changes to our business, are 75% done. I expect the remaining cost reductions, which are mostly aimed at our international business and real estate rationalization, to be completed by the end of the third quarter. Let’s now discuss our expectations for the second half of 2020. Internationally, we anticipate drilling activity to continue to decline modestly while completions stay resilient into year end. The activity changes have not been and will not be uniform across all international markets. On a full year basis, we expect activity in the OPEC countries in the Middle East and the Norwegian sector of the North Sea to be more resilient while Latin America and Africa decline sharply. Some customers are deferring new projects, most notably in the offshore exploration markets. Due to the deeper and longer pull back in Latin America, we now anticipate a mid-teens decline in international customer activity and spend for the full year.  In North America land, some green shoots of completion activity are emerging, but I would not characterize this as the start of a meaningful recovery. After customers bring back shut-in production and as WTI remains range bound around $40, we expect to see a modest uptick in completions activity during the third quarter followed by the usual seasonal deceleration at the end of the year. Drilling activity declines have slowed and we believe the rig count should find a bottom sometime in the third quarter, but a meaningful inflection point in drilling seems further out. Our full year customer spend outlook for North America remains unchanged at approximately 50% down compared to 2019, with gassier basins outperforming the oilier ones.  Further demand weakness from a slower economic recovery or multiple waves of COVID-19 related activity shutdowns present downside risks to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Though we believe we’re positioning our company to ride out those events should they occur, it is not possible to predict the impact that they may have. Regardless, as demonstrated this quarter, I expect Halliburton to outperform the market under any conditions. As we look into the future, I believe the international and North America markets will present opportunities for Halliburton. Although the timing of commodity price recovery remains uncertain, we are taking the necessary actions to thrive in the current market and to prepare Halliburton to win the eventual recovery. International producers have the opportunity to regain market share as a result of declining U.S. production. This should translate into healthy activity levels internationally as oil demand recovers. International shorter cycle barrels will likely fill a higher proportion of future incremental demand requirements. As economic growth returns, we expect the key producing regions to maintain productive spare capacity so they can quickly meet demand. Offshore, longer cycle barrels and new exploration activity will likely be the farthest out in terms of incremental contribution to the supply stack.  Today, we have an excellent international business both in terms of geographic footprint and technology portfolio. Pre-coronavirus, our international business grew revenue every quarter for almost three years, outperforming our largest competitor, and was on the road to meaningful margin improvement. International regions contributed nearly half of our revenue in 2019. They are also historically more resilient on margins, demonstrating the strength of our diverse business. Here’s how we are preparing to win the recovery internationally. We’re driving adoption and expansion of our latest technologies in the international markets. Our EarthStar logging-while-drilling tool has seen a 2.5 times increase in its adoption over the last year, even though it is one of our premium offerings. Our Cerebro in-bit sensor package provides a high speed look at data captured directly from the bit. Its international adoption has doubled this year compared to the first half of 2019. We’ve successfully completed customer qualifications and are currently deploying the latest wire line tractors and ESP pumps in the Middle East.  We are growing and monetizing our digital offerings. They improve performance and efficiency and allow us to introduce new commercial models where all parties share in the benefits of our digital technologies. The Aker BP project in Norway is a demonstration of a customer successfully adopting digital technology to achieve best-in-class performance. We have collaborated with our alliance partners to deploy digitally enabled new technologies and innovative ways of working. Our contract structure, where all alliance partners benefit from these successes, fosters a collaborative culture and drives further performance improvement. We increased rate of penetration by 88% over the course of the well campaign and a third of the wells we drilled on a specific prospect were in the top decile of the industry benchmark for drilling speed. We made great strides in the digital transformation of the well planning cycle, rapidly working towards the goal of planning a well in a day. We applied digital 3D inversion, helping the customer improve their reservoir understanding. This led to re-planning of a whole reservoir section and potential incremental reserves for the customer.  We are also advancing alliances with key industry players both within and outside of the oil and gas sector. We recently announced Halliburton and TechnipFMC collaborated to create Odyssey, the world’s first distributed acoustic sensing solution for subsea wells. This collaboration strengthens our digital capabilities in subsea reservoir monitoring and production optimization. We recently signed a five-year strategic agreement with Microsoft and Accenture to advance Halliburton’s digital capabilities in Microsoft Azure. This is an important step in our adoption of new technology and applications to enhance our digital capabilities and customer offerings, drive additional business agility, and reduce capital expenditures.  We are also taking actions not only to thrive in the current market but to best position our business in the future. Streamlining our cost structure is part of a continuing effort to reduce our fixed costs and improving components of our working capital through a strong focus on managing collections, deploying digital inventory planning solutions, and extending vendor payment terms.  As oil demand recovers, I expect the international business will continue to be a more meaningful contributor to our revenue going forward. I believe that the actions we are taking provide the basis for margin expansion and higher free cash flow conversion internationally in the next up cycle. Turning to North America, we believe that North America production is likely to remain structurally lower in the foreseeable future and have slower growth going forward. With shrinking demand for shale oil and limited access to capital markets, the inevitable rationalization will continue and we expect to see a more disciplined market with stronger operators and service companies. The activity declines and intra-year cyclicality over the last two years led us to change our approach to this market, but what has not changed is our commitment to the single largest oilfield services market and to our leadership position in it. While the North America market will be structurally smaller, we believe that it will be more profitable for us. Our service delivery improvement strategy lowers our fixed and services costs and will drive higher contribution margin with the goal to make Halliburton the most competitive from a cost structure perspective. This strategy has resulted in sustainable changes to how we organize and execute every day in the business and positions us to deliver higher profitability and free cash flow in North America. Our playbook is clear - returns in cash generation matter more than ever, and growth for the sake of market share is a thing of the past. We believe that our size and scale combined with our ability to quickly respond to changing market conditions are strong advantages for us, helping to drive the unit costs down and enabling us to capture work across multiple basins and resource types. The $1.3 billion in cost cuts, a combination of the $300 million in prior cuts and the $1 billion in further reductions, are largely aimed at North America. Let me remind you what we have done to reset the earnings power in this key market. We are changing the fundamentals of how we deliver our services and I expect this will drive a higher contribution margin and lower our fixed costs. We reduced our maintenance cost per horsepower hour by over a third compared to the 2019 run rate by redesigning our maintenance and value engineering processes. This has been scale tested as a permanent change in how we execute our operations and is independent of the market activity levels.  We’ve also made permanent reductions to our workforce. We have flattened our North America organization, removing layers of management. We are using digital and remote operations to reduce the number of frack engineers required to monitor jobs by establishing real-time operations centers and using cloud-based solutions to modernize data flow between the rig site and the back office. We are reducing our real estate footprint by over 100 facilities, which not only removes costs but fits with our digital and remote operations strategy.  In addition to these strategic changes, we will continue to take advantage of our unique competitive strengths. We offer a full suite of oilfield services through 13 product service lines in North America, and we will continue to emphasize our non-frack revenue streams, resulting in a more balanced business portfolio. We continue to deliver differentiated technologies across our product lines, many of them using advances in automation and digitalization. These technologies either lower our costs or improve production results for our customers.  Finally and critically, none of the improvements internationally and in North America happen without our fantastic competitive and committed team focused on achieving all of these objectives and protecting the gains we make over time.  Turning to capital spending, 2020 will be the second year in a row that we have significantly reduced our capex, which will largely be directed towards our international business. Because we size our capital budget based on a committed project pipeline and anticipate returns, we believe that this year, just like in 2019, this capex reduction will not hamper our ability to outperform the market. We will continue to exercise thoughtful capital allocation to the best returning opportunities. The capital intensity of our business has come down and as we think about the future, we project that capex spend as a percentage of revenue will be closer to 5 to 6% versus the historical norms of 10 to 11%.  There are several reasons why we were able to drive this change and positively impact our free cash flow going forward. We now build our equipment cheaper and it lasts longer. Advances in sensing technologies and material sciences are lowering the total cost of ownership for our tools. Design improvements such as component modularity make asset velocity better than ever. This means we need to build fewer tools to support the same level of business. For example, the iCruise drilling system has modular components and standardized electronic inserts for all tool sizes, allowing for 20% better asset velocity.  Digitalization reduces our capital footprint. We’re removing equipment from location and replacing costly hardware with software solutions. We do not anticipate large technology recapitalization programs similar to the build-out of our leading Q10 pumps and the iCruise drilling systems. Finally, the North America business now has structurally lower capital requirements. It is a mature market and frack job intensity is plateauing.  The Halliburton I have just described to you is charting a fundamentally different course. The growth in digital technologies, the position of strength in the international markets, the sharper approach to North America, and a lower capex profile, all of that comes from the hard work that we have been doing over the last few years. We are not waiting for an up cycle to drive significant free cash flow and returns for our shareholders. We believe that the strategic actions we are taking today will further boost our earnings power and free cash flow generation ability as we power into and win the eventual recovery. Now I’ll turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our second quarter financial results. Lance?
Lance Loeffler: Thank you Jeff, and good morning. Let’s start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2020. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.2 billion and adjusted operating income was $236 million, representing decreases of 37% and 53% respectively. In the second quarter, we recognized $2.1 billion of pre-tax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted primarily of non-cash asset impairments mainly associated with pressure pumping equipment and real estate, as well as inventory write-offs, severance, and other costs.  As a result of this charge, we realized a $49 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter. This impact is reflected in our division results with approximately two-thirds associated with our C&P division and the remainder related to our D&E division. We expect our third quarter depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $225 million, reflecting one month of additional impact. As Jeff mentioned, by the end of the second quarter we also accomplished approximately 75% of the annualized $1 billion in cost reductions, and we intend to complete most of the remaining actions by the end of the third quarter. The cash cost associated with the various cost actions in the second quarter was approximately $180 million. We anticipate that we will incur an additional cash cost of approximately $60 million in the third quarter as we continue to make further structural adjustments.  Moving to our division results, our completion and production revenue was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 44%, while operating income was $159 million, a decrease of 54%. These declines were largely a result of a decrease in pressure pumping activity globally primarily driven by U.S. land and Latin America, coupled with lower artificial lift activity in U.S. land. These were partially offset by improved completion tool sales internationally. Our drilling and evaluation revenue was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 27%, while operating income was $127 million, a decrease of 41%. These declines were primarily due to a global reduction in drilling-related services and lower software sales internationally.  In North America, revenue was $1 billion, a 57% decrease. This decline was driven by reduced activity in U.S. land primarily associated with pressure pumping, well construction, artificial lift, and wire line activity coupled with reduced activity across multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue was $346 million, a 33% decrease resulting primarily from decreased activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina, Colombia and Brazil, and lower software sales in Mexico.  Turning to Europe-Africa-CIS, revenue was $691 million, a 17% decrease resulting primarily from reduced well construction and pressure pumping activity and lower software sales across the region. This was partially offset by increased fluids activity and completion tool sales in Norway and improved cementing activity and completion tool sales in Russia.  In the Middle East-Asia region, revenue was $1.1 billion, a 10% decrease largely resulting from reduced activity across the majority of product service lines in the Middle East, Malaysia and India, partially offset by improved drilling activity and completion tool sales in China and Kuwait.  In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $50 million, and this amount should serve as the new quarterly run rate for the rest of the year.  Our interest expense for the quarter was $124 million. For the third quarter, we expect it will be closer to $130 million.  Other expense for the quarter was $48 million, primarily driven by our foreign exchange exposure and currency weakness in Argentina. Looking ahead, we expect it will be approximately $30 million for the third quarter.  Our normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 25%, driven by certain discrete tax items and a lower earnings base. For the third quarter and full year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24% and 20% respectively.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were $142 million and our full year 2020 capex estimate of $800 million remains unchanged.  Turning to cash flow, we generated $598 million of cash from operations during the second quarter. As anticipated, working capital was a source of cash. As activity declines globally, working capital has historically been a strong source of cash and we expect to see continued benefits from working capital for the rest of this year.  Free cash flow generation for the quarter was $456 million. Our year-to-date and expected earnings performance for the remainder of the year combined with working capital benefits and lower capex should result in full year free cash flow of over $1 billion. Finally, while we remain cautious about the forecasted pace of economic recovery and the potential for additional COVID-related shutdowns, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the third quarter playing out based on our outlook. Sequentially, we expect overall company revenue to decline low single digits in the third quarter. Lower average rig activity across most regions will impact our D&E division while modest completions activity improvements should drive C&P division revenue to be flat to slightly up. The full quarter benefit and continued execution of our cost reductions should offset the impact of lower activity on our profitability. As a result, we expect to deliver higher sequential operating income and modestly higher margin.  Let me now turn the call back over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks Lance. To sum up our discussion today, our second quarter performance in a touch market demonstrates our organization’s ability to execute swiftly and aggressively, and we expect to complete our remaining cost actions in the third quarter. We have an excellent international business and it is ready to deliver margin expansion and higher free cash flow conversion in the next up cycle. The actions we have taken in North America, including our service delivery improvement strategy, we believe will enable us to have higher profitability and free cash flow even in a structurally lower environment.  We are moving full steam ahead with the deployment of digital technologies for our customers and internally, and finally Halliburton is charting a fundamentally different course. I believe the strategic actions we are taking today will further boost our earnings power and free cash flow generation ability as we power into and win the eventual recovery. Now let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
James West: Hey, good morning guys. 
Jeff Miller: Morning James.
James West: Congrats on the execution in a really [indiscernible] quarter here. Jeff, you talk about this--you’re charting a fundamentally different course, and I think it’s definitely appropriate. We have a vision of the oilfield that I think aligns with your vision for the future of the oilfield - of course digital, lower capital intensity, higher returns are all part of that strategy. Could you maybe talk about where you are in the various parts of that journey, both the digital side, obviously the cost structure in North America - you’re pretty far along in that and you talked about that, maybe the international and the technology delivery?
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks James, and again when I look through the noise of the COVID disruption and industry consolidation and rationalization, clearly we do focus on what is that new course, and we are working on those things right now. I talked about a number of them in my commentary, but we are focused on doubling down on the technology that’s important, drilling, iCruise, EarthStar, Cerebro, digital, growing our lift in chemicals businesses, which I described in the commentary, and then feeding that technology into our fantastic international business, finally delivering on North America service delivery improvement strategy while at the same time demonstrating structurally lower capex built on capital efficiency in an organization that executes under any conditions. So yes, we are charting a different course.  Progress along digital, we’d talk about each quarter different things that we’re doing. We’re making terrific progress around Halliburton 4.0, feel very good about the kinds of contracts we’re signing today and the work that’s being done behind the scenes to continue to advance that, and obviously you saw some of our announcements with partners this quarter. 
James West: Okay, so you feel good about the path you’re charting here. What about on the customer side? It seems to me it’s a fundamentally different mindset from the customers as well. What’s their approach or their adoption of these new technologies, particularly on the digital side, and how is that progressing? Are they impediments to change now, or are they really aligning with your view and others views?
Jeff Miller: Look, I’ve always said that digital has to evolve. It’s something that’s built out over time, and it’s done often with partners, so we’ve talked about our partners, but yes, there is appetite for it, absolutely. I think that--when I think about it in terms of reservoir drilling and production, those are the bites that can digested today, and so that’s why when we talk about progress and the things that we’re doing, we’re doing them in those sort of silos not because we view them long term as silos, but because that’s the way that they can be digested right now. 
James West: I see, okay. Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Angie Sedita: Thanks, good morning. Really impressive quarter. It’s almost unbelievable, the numbers are so good, so kudos to you guys.  International markets, as you touched on Jeff, really important for growth, and you highlighted some of the initiatives there. But can you talk a little bit about cost cutting opportunities and the opportunity to further improve margins? Obviously D&E margins had a nice move in Q1, but can you talk about additional efforts there on the cost cutting side, and then I know there’s a focus on generating more free cash flow out of the international markets, so maybe--and it is over 50% of your revenue, so maybe talk a little bit further about international.
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks Angie. Look, I think we are positioned in the right markets, the strong markets. We’ve got the technology uptake that’s so important in those markets, and then what we’re doing around lower capital efficiency, or improving capital efficiency, plays straight into that. I expect that we will continue to see progress in those markets, and they will be stronger over time.
Angie Sedita: Okay, so maybe you can talk a little bit about the evolution here in your capex profile. I think that’s really shone through here in ’19 and ’20 in becoming a lower capital intensive company, and really re-thinking the U.S. land market. Maybe can you talk a little further about that capex profile, how you’re looking at the market differently particularly in the U.S., and the long term ability to generate more cash flow, free cash flow?
Jeff Miller: Yes, thank you. When I think about the type of equipment we’re building and actually using equipment more efficiently, lowering the cost of that equipment, those are all the kinds of things that we look at. Obviously we’re focused on improving returns, using our digital capabilities to eliminate costs. We’ve removed roughly 100 facilities, but we only removed 100 facilities by changing the way we work dramatically so that it just takes less capital, and that plays into everything from maintenance to where people work, etc. That’s sort of a North America view.  Now, those same skills and capabilities are applicable everywhere in the world, and so I expect us to continue to drive cost out of our business. That’s really--so when I talk about charting a different course, digital international strength and then a leaner organization that drives technology and efficiency, I think leaner and efficiency and the technology applications will be driving cost out all of the time, including internationally.
Angie Sedita: Great, thanks Jeff. I’ll turn it over.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is now open.
Bill Herbert: Good morning, and thank you. Lance, a couple questions for you on cash flow. First of all, do you expect the working capital harvest in the second half of the year to be as substantial as it was in Q2? And then also, difficult to be precise in [indiscernible] with regard to--
Lance Loeffler: Bill, you’re breaking up on me. I’m sorry, I didn’t get all of your question. 
Bill Herbert: Sorry, can you hear me now?
Lance Loeffler: It’s a little muffled. 
Bill Herbert: Yes, okay. The question was, one, working capital as a source of cash, is it as substantial in the second half of the year as it was in the second quarter? Then with regard to your cash cost saves, difficult to answer, but in the event of a change in regime in November, how do you think about it with regard to your cash costs, as in do you have enough cash--do you have enough tax shield to offset a rise in the corporate tax rate? Thanks.
Lance Loeffler: Yes, so let me address the first part of your question, which is, I think, the working capital unwind and the momentum in the second half of the year. Clearly we had a strong cash flow associated with the unwind in working capital in Q2. I suspect that that momentum continues into Q3 and Q4. It may not be as strong just because we had such--you know, with the revenue declines just in the course of Q2 and the unwind around receivables, and then offset by payables, it was good to see. The organization continues to be really efficient on how we continue to wring out the cash flow generated for working capital. It may not be as strong as the third quarter but I still expect momentum to--excuse me, the second quarter, but I still expect momentum from the unwind to continue to occur in Q3 and Q4. Can you repeat the second question? I think you were talking about administrative expenses, but again, Bill, it’s kind of hard to pick you up.
Bill Herbert: Yes, sorry about this. [Indiscernible] in the event that we have a change in regime in early November, I guess what Biden’s talking about is a 28% corporate tax rate. I’m just curious as to whether with your tax shield, net operating losses, losses etc., do you expect to be [indiscernible] in 2021?
Lance Loeffler: No, we don’t, Bill. We’ve got--certainly we do have the NOLs associated--I mean, look, there’s always other ways that Halliburton continues to pay tax, cash taxes, but at the federal tax level we expect that we’ll have tax shields from NOLs.
Bill Herbert: Thank you very much.
Lance Loeffler: Thanks Bill.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Sean Meakim: Thank you, good morning.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, Sean.
Sean Meakim: So the decrementals were very impressive - you know, a huge difference compared to what we saw in 2015 and 2016. I was hoping we could just get a better sense of the run rate for C&P going forward. Impairments helped with lower D&A, I appreciate you quantifying that for 3Q. It looks like a 400 basis point assistance from 1Q to 3Q. Were there margin benefits from the inventory write-downs? I’m just curious if completions activity gets a little better in 3Q, does the margin follow at the EBITDA line, so looking past EBIT to the EBITDA line?
Lance Loeffler: Yes, look - I think the changes that we’ve described, and based on the guidance we’ve given, I think this has been a--you know, the margins that we’ve reset today clearly have been helped by some of the accounting changes and the impairments that we’ve taken over the first part of the year. But look, it’s not to say that we haven’t done a significant amount of work around the cost cuts, which we believe are permanent. It goes across everything that we’re doing, whether it’s drilling, digital, production, frack in North America as Jeff has described, and so I think in terms of our margin progression, we’re going to continue to work that as hard as we can. We’ve still got some room to continue to improve on that cost cutting journey, as we described in our remarks, and I think it sets us up ultimately that when activity moves up, all of this is done with the expectation that we ultimately have stronger incrementals with these permanent cost cuts and changes. 
Jeff Miller: Let me just follow that up with--I mean, the way to look at things in my view is what’s that new course look like, and that new course looks like substantially lower costs, like a reset around costs, where we’re directing our energies towards digital being much sharper in North America around how we invest, what we do, and how we manage that cost structure, internationally continuing to protect and pour technology in that market, and then the structurally lower capex. That all comes from changing things that we’re doing, and so we are changing many businesses processes and just the way we view things, which ultimately drives substantially lower costs and resets margins and cash flow higher.
Sean Meakim: Right, got it. I appreciate that. So then just as a follow-up, if we think that EBIT will be higher quarter over quarter, modestly higher margins as a percentage, does that follow same for EBITDA? Do you think EBITDA can grow quarter over quarter?
Lance Loeffler: Well, I think the implications with everything that we’ve described, Sean, on our prepared remarks will tell you that EBITDA is relatively flat, even though the top line is coming down. 
Sean Meakim: Got it. Very helpful, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open.
David Anderson: Hey, good morning Jeff. Obviously international is a bigger part of your business now going forward. Just wondering, in your outlook as you think about international markets, how they’re trending, how you’ve thought about pricing in that outlook, and in particular in the second half of the year. Hearing some reports about pricing concessions being asked for the NOCs, particularly in the Middle East, so I was just wondering if you could talk about that and whether you think that’s a concern or risk for the industry. I know you have a lot of other contracts, LSTK contracts and whatnot, so maybe you can just talk about both sets, if you wouldn’t mind, please?
Jeff Miller: Yes, I think the fact is pricing never recovered internationally, and at this point we haven’t seen many tenders so we don’t have much of a view of that. But bottom line is there’s much less capital internationally - I mean, the excess capital just isn’t there maybe the way that it is in the U.S., so that’s probably getting sorted out in the U.S. as well.  Most of the dialog has been more around working on efficiencies, how to drive more efficient operations both for our customers and for us, and less so around pricing. It doesn’t mean that they don’t get asked about, but at the same time the only effective path forward is to drive better efficiency, utilization of technology, and that sort of thing internationally. I’d say that applies to NOCs and IOCs.
David Anderson: So you’re not being asked to cut your--I didn’t mean on new tenders, I meant on existing work, you’re not being asked to cut price on existing work?
Jeff Miller: Yes, I understand, and I would say that certainly the first response is let’s look for ways to drive better efficiency, not address pricing, because most of these contracts that are in place today were lit arguably at the bottom international cycle, which was in 2016.
David Anderson: Fair point. You mentioned digital quite a bit on today’s call. Just curious about something as you’re looking forward. In terms of where you want to be, let’s just think two or three years down the road here, do you think you can pull all the technology out internally; in other words, can you create all this organically, or do you need to look outside? I guess if I look back in the past, looking back in the mid-90s, technology acquisitions were critical obviously to you and some of your biggest competitors - I’m thinking about Landmark, or course. How are you thinking about that going forward? Is that something you’re going to have look outside of Halliburton? Is it a combination? Just your broader views on that, please.
Jeff Miller: Yes, broadly I treat that the same as we do most of our M&A, in the sense that when we see opportunities to accelerate R&D or we see things that are important adds, we make them, and we’ve continued to do smaller transactions around our digital offerings, so we’re very thoughtful around the build versus buy approach, and that’s a lot of the valuation. We feel like we can, through partners and others, get into all of the things we need to do and deliver platform solutions, and so there’s not a big transformational thing that’s in our minds. More importantly in my view is continuing to advance the R&D around digital.
David Anderson: Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning everybody. I guess we’ll kind of stick on this digital and remote operations that you guys have been talking about through the quarter, the past couple quarters. I guess first, how should we think about the structural margin improvement from these cost savings initiatives on the remote operations and automation side, and how much benefit did you see in 2Q? Then the second part of the question is really how easily can competitors replicate this strategy over time?
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks Chase. Q2, I mean, the digital technology and the digital approach that we are taking is what enables the cost reductions that we are--a large part of the cost reductions that we’re seeing in Q2. I wouldn’t describe it as enough activity to actually drive the kind of incremental--I mean, it will drive terrific incrementals as we see any activity grow, but the ability--I’m going to stick with real estate rationalization just as a proxy for the kind of things that can be removed when we use the digital solutions that we have internally. For our customers, I think I described in my remarks at least one example around how digital solutions are driving much better performance, both for our customers and for ourselves, and so I think that we will continue to see that play a role.  Replicating digital at scale is very difficult. I mean, I think that will prove to be--I know what’s involved in it for us, and I know that we’re working with some of the very best partners in the industry, and it’s not--it takes a lot of work on our part and a lot of discipline around platform outcomes that are scalable and reliable all the time, so I think that I’m quite confident about where we’re going.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, great. Appreciate the color. One quick follow-up on the capex side. You mentioned 5 to 6% of revenues being spent on capex. Can you confirm that that’s a long-term capex number and maybe how much of that is maintenance versus growth, and then if this implies that maybe on the international side that the market share gain strategy is less of a focus over the medium to longer term?
Jeff Miller: Yes, I think that the 5 to 6% versus the 10 to 11 is a longer term outlook that’s based on capital efficiency, just to how we build things and how we take them to market, how fast we move them around, all of the things that drive lower capital requirements. I believe those changes are largely permanent also.  When I think about how that plays out internationally, I think that same efficiency, a lot of the technology and tools that I described particularly around capital efficiency, whether it’s iCruise or Cerebro or some of those technologies, are inherently lower capital requirements when they’re being used. Obviously we went through a period of building that out over the last year, but operationally they operate at probably 20% less--you know, more efficient, better velocity. I think we have that to reap internationally over time.
Chase Mulvehill: Perfect. All right, I’ll turn it back over. Thanks Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Scott Gruber: Yes, good morning.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning Scott.
Scott Gruber: The big question for you and peers has been how to make a profit in a smaller U.S. market, and you guys obviously took a great stride here in Q2 to proving that’s very possible. Lance, you mentioned strong incrementals during the recovery here, and I realize we’re just starting to poke out heads out of the bunker from one of the worst downturns we’ve ever seen, but if we do get back to 500 or 600 rigs operating in the U.S., which is more or less consensus I think, what’s a reasonable range to think about where C&P margins could rise to?
Lance Loeffler: Scott, I’ll talk to that. Look, I think as you look into the future and to what the recovery may look like in North America, and the picture that you painted around activity, I think this is going to continue to be a good business that delivers mid-teens margins and produce a heck of a lot of free cash flow. Given the things that we’ve talked about on this call today operationally and the way that we’re becoming sharper in North America with our service delivery improvement initiatives, on top of just structurally lower capex requirements to achieve that business, drives a really nice free cash flow profile, we believe.
Jeff Miller: Yes, and I think in North America--go ahead? Sorry.
Scott Gruber: No, go ahead, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: I’ll only add one thing to that, because as we look at North America, if we just sort of assumed a flat level of production in ’21 and then we moved that forward into ‘22, we see all of the attrition and tightening that is happening. I think we were well on this path at the end of last year coming into this year, and we saw solid performance in Q1. We expect we get back to a market that’s probably size and shape, at least from the supply and demand of equipment standpoint, something that looks like Q1 2020 sometime further out, and the approach that we’re taking, I think will work very well for us.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Then just given your technology investments on the D&E side and given the cost reset on that side of the business as well, kind of just where you stand in terms of the market share gains internationally, do you think when we’re at mid cycle in the next cycle, is the gap between C&P margin and D&E margins much smaller than what we’ve seen in the last few cycles?
Jeff Miller: Yes, I would expect so. I mean, again we have expectations that that business continues to improve also, and we were well on the way to doing that really up until we got into the pandemic situation and where we are today, but none of the fundamentals have changed around what we’re doing other than, I think, a sharper cost structure around these things. 
Scott Gruber: Appreciate it, thank you. 
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is now open.
Marc Bianchi: Thank you. I wanted to ask first on the third quarter outlook for completions. I think you mentioned up for your North America C&P business. Do you see that outperforming the market; in other words, do you think that the market could be flat to down but Halliburton’s up, or do you also see the market up in the third quarter?
Jeff Miller: For completions, I think we’re off the bottom in May and I think you’ll see a little bit of an uptick in Q3 as DUCs get completed. Drilling, we think will be down a little bit, and I think that will be many of our customers managing decline rates into the end of the year. But you know, our view of the market is it stays with making returns and taking on the work that we believe we can execute well, so I think that’s what the overall market will do and I think we’ll be in around that.
Marc Bianchi: Great, thanks for that, Jeff. Then you guys had mentioned in the press release and then a few times on this call about winning the recovery. Maybe if you could offer for us a little bit more color on what that means, what are the metrics we should be looking for from you guys in terms of claiming victory on that front?
Jeff Miller: I think that’s returns and cash flows. We spent a lot of time talking about free cash flow and returns, and that’s what we’re setting up for today. I think we get well through whatever this period of time is until we see commodity prices tighten. I think we do well through this near term, but then when we start to see tightening, we’re going to have the right cost structure that scales very efficiently with strong incrementals, and it delivers a lot of free cash flow and very, very good returns. That’s what winning the recovery looks like to me. 
Marc Bianchi: Is there a threshold? Is there a target that we should be looking for, percentage of revenue in terms of free cash--
Jeff Miller: I think we ought to get closer to that point before we start setting targets around that, but my expectations are that it’s a very strong performance by Halliburton. But it’s out there a ways.
Marc Bianchi: Great, thank you.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning. 
Jeff Miller: Morning Kurt.
Kurt Hallead: Jeff, I was just kind of curious, when you provided the outlook here for the second half of 2020, you indicated an uptick in completion activity in the third quarter and then a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. I’m just curious on that, just given how rapid the decline in that overall activity was and how sharp the decline in overall spending has been for 2020, so I guess you’re picking up that dynamic from your discussions with customers, so they’re going to get a little more active in the third quarter and just pull back again in the fourth? It seems a little bit counterintuitive, just given how sharply spend and activity has already been cut.
Jeff Miller: Yes, look - I think it’s going to rest more around DUC activity as we go into the second half of the year, so on a relative basis, more pronounced Q3, less pronounced Q4 would be my impression. I think every customer is working their own strategy around what do they need to do as they go into 2021, which will be obviously a time where some stability needs to return to productive capacity and those sorts of things. So is it more modest in Q4? It may be, but my overall outlook is it will be relatively biased even if you just take into account holidays and all the sorts of things that happen in Q4, along with weather. This isn’t the kind of market where you power through terrible weather in an effort to try to get to some point, I don’t think, in Q4. 
Kurt Hallead: Okay, that’s good color. Just maybe one quick follow-up here. It looks like the run rate on capex will be a little bit higher in the second half than it was in the first half. You indicated that your capex is project pipeline driven, so is it safe to assume here that you’re starting to see an increase in potential project activity going out into 2021?
Jeff Miller: No, I think what we see are some long lead time items that we do. We talked about projects being deferred but not necessarily cancelled, so we have to manage all of that together, so precisely where those things fall in the calendar is where they fall. I think what’s most important to think about around capital really is the overall efficiency that we’ve driven into both the tools, the process, the asset velocity which will structurally help us keep that at a much lower point than it has been in the past.
Kurt Hallead: Okay, great. Appreciate that follow-up. Thanks.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question and answer session for today. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.
Operator:
Jeff Miller: Thank you Liz. Before we wrap up today’s call, I’d like to leave you with a few closing comments. Our second quarter performance demonstrates Halliburton’s ability to execute swiftly and aggressively. The actions we have taken in North America we believe will enable higher profitability and free cash flow, even in a structurally lower environment. We have an excellent international business and are moving full steam ahead with the deployment of digital technologies, both for our customers and internally. Most importantly, Halliburton is charting a fundamentally different course. I believe the strategic actions we are taking today will meaningfully reset our earnings power and free cash flow ability as we power into and win the eventual recovery. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Liz, please close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for joining, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-20 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Halliburton First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I'd now like to hand the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Abu Zeya: Thank you, Gigi. Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2020 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton’s website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019; recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments and other charges as well as expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release and can also be found in the Quarterly Results & Presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Well. Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. We're speaking with you today as billions of people are under some form of quarantine in their homes. Businesses and schools are disrupted and worldwide travel has generally come to a halt. The human and economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic is being felt globally. At the same time, our industry is facing the dual shock of a massive drop in global oil demand, coupled with a resulting oversupply.  As the world is battling the pandemic, I thank our employees for their continued focus during these difficult times. We are a critical part of the global energy infrastructure and an essential service to satisfy both immediate and long-term energy needs. On our customers' work sites and within our facilities, Halliburton people are getting the job done, while taking the appropriate steps to protect themselves and others. Our tiered crisis response model has been road tested in the past through hurricanes and other catastrophic events and it is working well in the current circumstances. Globally, our corporate crisis team monitors the evolving situation across all of our core functions from health and safety to IT infrastructure to supply chain, and provides guidance to support our local response plans. Locally, every country has reviewed their emergency response plans, assessed them for business continuity and activated them in alignment with local authorities. To ensure the safety for all, who must go to a work location, we've provided specific direction about how to work in a COVID-19 world and elevated cleaning protocols for our facilities and equipment.  We've adjusted shifts and rotations to maximize social distancing, as well as implemented varying levels of medical screenings as appropriate. We are maximizing remote work where possible and are encouraging our employees and customers to collaborate virtually using information sharing tools.  Now, let me cover some headlines for what was a solid first quarter of 2020. We finished the quarter with total company revenue of $5.0 billion, a 12% decrease year-over-year; and adjusted operating income of $502 million, an increase of 18% from the first quarter of 2019. Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 19% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and operating margin expanded 170 basis points.  Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered a strong quarter. Revenue was flat year-over-year and operating margin grew 450 basis points. Our North America revenue declined 25% due to lower activity and pricing in U.S. land. Internationally, we delivered 5% growth this quarter. This marked the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue increases for our international business.  Finally, free cash flow was effectively neutral for the quarter, which is a significant improvement compared to the first quarter of 2019 and reflects our focus on driving more working capital efficiencies. The first quarter seems like a long time ago, but it is an important demonstration of some key facts. Here's what it tells me.  We make commitments and execute on them quickly. We completed the previously announced $300 million in cost savings. We demonstrated the ability to improve our margins and lower our costs of service delivery. And the Halliburton team is well prepared to adjust and deliver under any market conditions.  Although we came into 2020 with improving expectations for our financial performance in the North America and international markets, the dislocations resulting from the pandemic and the precipitous decline in oil prices have significantly altered those expectations. Let me describe to you what I see ahead of us, recognizing that the market is still in motion.  Activity is in free fall in North America and is slowing down internationally. We cannot predict the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on demand or the pace of any subsequent recovery. At a minimum, we expect the decline in activity to continue through year end. Though we have not experienced anything like the impact of COVID-19 pandemic before, under adverse market conditions, we know what buttons to push and what levers to pull. And we are doing so with swiftness and resolve. Today's market calls for deeper immediate actions. We're significantly reducing costs, cutting CapEx and managing working capital. I will give more detail on each of these actions in a few minutes.  We are unwavering on our commitment to safety and service quality for our customers and our focus on cash flow generation and industry leading returns for our shareholders. And we believe our near term actions will not only temper the impact of activity declines on our financial performance, but also ensure that we are in a strong position financially and structurally to take advantage of the market’s eventual recovery. Before we get into the operational discussion, let me address a few topics I deem critically important in the near term.  First, I believe Halliburton has sufficient liquidity, approximately $5 billion including cash on hand and our undrawn credit facility. Second, in the first quarter, we successfully executed both a tender offer for some of our bonds and a debt offering. As a result, we retired $500 million in total debt and extended the maturity for our $1 billion of senior notes out to 2030. We have focused on debt reduction over the last few years, and we enter this downturn with $2.6 billion less debt than in 2016. We also have a very manageable debt maturity profile with only $1.3 billion coming due through 2024. De-leveraging remains a key priority. We believe our free cash flow generation will be sufficient to pay down upcoming debt maturities in the normal course of business.  Finally, our dividend is a lever we can pull, based on our market outlook and valuations. Our Board and management review the dividend quarterly, and will act prudently to make adjustments for the long-term success of our business. Let me be clear. We have no intentions to increase leverage to maintain the dividend. We also do not intend to allow the dividend to prevent us from being structurally and financially positioned to take advantage of the eventual market recovery.  Now let me describe in more detail what I see unfolding in the markets globally; how we are prepared today compared to the most recent downturn and the actions we are taking to adjust our business to today's market.  The market in North America is experiencing the most dramatic and rapid activity decline in recent history. Our customers continue to revise their capital budgets downwards as they swiftly adjust spending levels in response to the lower commodity price. Right now, North American E&P CapEx is trending towards a 50% reduction year-on-year in 2020.  Since mid-March U.S. land rig count has fallen 34% and is expected to continue declining from here. With prices at the wellhead near cash breakeven levels, we expect activity in North America land to further deteriorate during the second quarter and remain depressed through year-end impacting all basins.  Our outlook for the international markets has also changed. In addition to the collapse of oil prices, the industry is dealing with activity interruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic. COVID-19 had minimal impact on our international operations in the first quarter, but the second quarter will be different. We're seeing restricted movements within countries, quarantine requirements for rotational staff, logistics delay due to third-party personnel reductions, and in some cases, entire country closures. Different markets are impacted differently and this will lead to significant operational disruptions at least through the second quarter.  Beyond these near-term headwinds, certain international customers are also fundamentally reducing capital spending, deferring exploration and appraisal activity and looking to cut costs on their major ongoing projects. We expect international spending to be down in the range of 10% on a full year basis.  OPEC+ production decisions and the duration of the pandemic related demand and activity disruptions will ultimately determine how much the international spending declines this year. International projects and contract structures tend to be longer term oriented. However, in the face of these unprecedented circumstances, our customers, IOCs, NOCs and independents alike, are all reassessing their priorities, with some reacting more swiftly than others. We believe the activity changes internationally will not be uniform across all markets. We anticipate that the least effected markets will be the OPEC countries in the Middle East, while offshore Africa and Latin America may see double-digit declines this year.  As operators in North America and international markets look for ways to cut spending, pricing is a lever they're seeking to pull. We continue to make pricing decisions based on our overall returns expectations for the business. Given the oversupply of fracturing equipment in North America, pricing levels in this market were already at historical lows coming into 2020. Internationally, the pricing increases we were starting to see will take a pause. We will work to improve efficiencies as a means to optimize costs for both our customers and Halliburton. It is important to remember, we were coming into this downturn from a very different place than in 2014, and we believe these differences prepare us better for what lies ahead. Spending in the North America market was down in 2019. In response, we introduced a new playbook to prioritize returns over market share. We restructured our North America organization, rationalized our real estate footprint, completed a cost out program and started addressing our fixed costs through the service delivery improvement strategy.  We clearly had momentum from these efforts coming into 2020. Our more efficient Q10 pumps now represent 100% of our fracturing fleet. We also have the largest number of dual fuel and Tier 4 diesel fuel engines in the market. This fleet composition delivers differentiated service quality and efficiency and will ultimately drive the flight to quality when the market stabilizes in North America. We closed key technology gaps in drilling and openhole wireline, added new artificial lift and specialty chemicals capabilities to our portfolio, and continue to lower our costs across various product offerings. This has taken significant technology spend, which is now largely behind us. Our CapEx in 2019 was down year-over-year and we further reduced CapEx coming into 2020 to drive capital discipline across all of our business segments. As a result, we do not have the significant oversupply of tools and equipment in the international markets. We have built an operating machine to be effective and successful across cycles. Unfortunately, as we enter this downturn, we will need to make some painful decisions, and I am aware that this will cause great difficulty for our impacted employees.  We are implementing the following set of measures that will further reduce our costs and improve our cash generation ability as our customers continue to reduce their spending levels.  We were reducing our capital expenditures for 2020 to about $800 million, roughly 50% from 2019 levels. We believe this level of spend will allow us to invest in our key strategic areas, while continuing to support our business in the active markets. We will take out about $1 billion of annualized overhead and other costs across our entire business, with most of it happening in the next two quarters. To accomplish this, we are streamlining our global and regional headcount, consolidating multiple facilities, and removing another layer of operations management in North America. We're accelerating our service delivery improvement strategy in North America, redesigning the way we deliver our fracturing services to lower our unit cost and improved margins and returns in the long run. We are cutting our technology budget by 25%. We have stopped discretionary spend across the business and we have eliminated salary increases for all personnel this year, and I and other members of the executive committee have taken pay cuts.  Additionally, we will make variable headcount adjustments and rationalize our assets to be in line with the activity reductions we anticipate. As we look to reduce our own input costs, we're also renegotiating prices and terms with our suppliers. Finally, we will continue our efforts on working capital improvements across all three of its components. We believe these actions are necessary given the current environment and will help protect our balance sheet and drive cash flow and returns for our shareholders. As we steer the company through this downturn, we remain focused on the underlying drivers of success and our long-term strategic objectives. We will continue to execute our value proposition, deliver value and efficiency across our product offerings and remain focused on safety and service quality.  We remain committed to being leaders in North America by delivering on our low-cost service improvement strategy. We continue to closely collaborate with our customers and partners on leveraging digital solutions to reduce non-productive time and improve labor and asset efficiency. As I've stated on prior calls, we are in the early innings of our artificial lift and specialty chemicals growth internationally and we plan to continue down this path. We believe these businesses give us exposure to a later cycle market with long-term growth potential. We will continue to spend on technology that reduces our operating costs. We believe this is necessary for the future success of our business. We've been through downturns before. As the market unfolds from here, we believe we have the people, the technology and the depth of experience to outperform our competitors. If required, we will take further actions to adjust to the evolving market.  If I've learned something from all of the downturns I've been through in my career, it is that the industry always bounces back. This downturn, although the most severe we have seen in a generation, will be no different. I believe it will reshape our industry and position it better for the next cycle. At some point, returning global economic and oil demand growth, market balancing supply actions by key producing countries and declining non-OPEC production, will likely lead to a new reinvestment cycle. And I believe Halliburton will emerge stronger on the other side like we always have. Now, I will turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our first quarter financial results. Lance?
Lance Loeffler: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let's begin with an overview of our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2019. Today, our total company revenue for the quarter was $5 billion, a decrease of 12% year-over-year, while adjusted operating income was $502 million, an 18% increase. As Jeff mentioned, during the quarter, we accomplished the remaining $100 million of the announced $300 million in annualized cost reductions. In the first quarter, we recognized approximately $1.1 billion of pre-tax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted primarily of non-cash asset impairments, mostly associated with pressure pumping equipment, as well as severance and other costs.  In addition, based on the current market environment and its expected impact on our business outlook, we recognized a $310 million non-cash tax adjustment to our deferred tax assets.  Now let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3 billion, a decrease of $700 million or 19% when compared to the first quarter of 2019. Operating income was $345 million, a decrease of $23 million or 6%. These results were primarily due to the lower pressure pumping activity and pricing and reduced completion tool sales in North America partially offset by increased cementing activity and completion tool sales in the Eastern Hemisphere.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue was $2.1 billion which was flat from the first quarter of 2019, while operating income was $217 million, an increase of $94 million or 76%. Higher activity for drilling related services in the North Sea and Asia more than offset reduced activity and pricing for multiple product service lines in North America land and lower fluids activity in Latin America.  Moving on to our geographical results: In North America, revenue was $2.5 billion, a 25% decrease when compared to the first quarter of 2019. This decline was mainly due to reduced activity and pricing in North America land, primarily associated with pressure pumping, well construction and completion tool sales. This decline was partially offset by increased artificial lift activity and specialty chemical sales in North America land and stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico.  In Latin America, revenue was $516 million, a 12% decrease year-over-year, resulting primarily from reduced fluids activity and stimulation services across the region, particularly in Argentina. This was coupled with decreased activity in multiple product service lines in Brazil, Ecuador, and Colombia. These declines were partially offset by increased activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico and Guyana.  Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue was $831 million, an 11% increase year-over-year resulting primarily from increased drilling related activity in the North Sea, improved well construction activity in Russia and increased completions activity in Algeria, partially offset by reduced activity in multiple product service lines in Ghana.  In Middle East/Asia, revenue was $1.2 billion, a 9% increase year-over-year, largely resulting from increased activity in the majority of product service lines in the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia and Malaysia, which was partially offset by lower project management activity in India.  In the first quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $60 million and net interest expense was $134 million. Our normalized effective tax rate for the quarter was 21%.  We generated $225 million of cash from operations during the quarter. As anticipated, working capital was seasonally a use of cash but significantly lower than the draw we experienced in the first quarter of 2019. As activity declines globally, working capital has historically been a strong source of cash and I expect a similar pattern this year. We have a heightened focus on improving working capital metrics and are working hard to prudently manage customer credit risk in light of the current market conditions.  Capital expenditures during the quarter were $213 million. As Jeff mentioned, we have reduced our full year CapEx budget to approximately $800 million. These cuts are geared towards both our North America business and uncommitted projects internationally. We believe our capital allocation decisions are consistent with our focus on generating cash flow regardless of the market environment.  Our free cash flow generation for the quarter was $12 million. A significant improvement compared to the first quarter of 2019. During the quarter, we took actions to manage our debt and maturity profile. We executed two transactions, a debt issuance and a subsequent tender, which lowered our total debt by $500 million. But more importantly, it also reduced our 2023 and 2025 maturities by $1.5 billion.  As a result of these transactions, we incurred a net cost of $168 million related to early debt extinguishment. Our total outstanding debt was $9.8 billion as of March 31st. We have no current borrowings under our revolver and no financial covenants in our borrowing facilities for our debt agreements. Now, looking forward, our second quarter results will be impacted by the severity of the continuing activity declines in North America, customer project suspensions and delays internationally, and the uncertain duration of the pandemic-related disruptions, as well as actions related to the OPEC+ production cuts. These uncertainties and the exact timing of our cost reductions impacting our division results preclude us from providing specific guidance for the second quarter. We will continue to execute the measures that Jeff outlined. In addition to the activity-related variable cost adjustments, we plan to reduce annualized overhead and other costs by about $1 billion. To achieve that, we will have an associated cash cost of approximately $200 million. These reductions will target all of our business lines and support functions globally, and we expect to complete most of these actions within the next few quarters. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff for closing comments. Jeff?
Jeff Miller : Thanks, Lance. Before we close, there are two important themes that I see accelerating in the depths of this downturn. Both will be helpful today, but more importantly, they will create strong competitive advantages for us in the future. First, we are fast-tracking the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy in North America, as we restructure our overall North America business. We launched the strategy to lower the cost -- the overall cost of service delivery in the U.S. last year, and we will accelerate these efforts in the current market. Next, this downturn accelerates the adoption of digital technologies by our customers and by Halliburton internally. We are far along the road to delivering the next frontier of digital solutions that will help drive efficiencies in our workforce and reduce capital investments through automation and self-learning processes. In this environment, digitalization will unlock the potential to structurally lower costs and enhance performance across the entire value chain. I have never been more convinced that digital is the future and Halliburton is leading the way. With that, let me summarize our discussion today. To the Halliburton team, the path ahead will be challenging, but I have the utmost confidence in our ability to maintain focus and execute on our value proposition in this extremely difficult environment. Our balance sheet and liquidity positions are solid, and we plan to continue taking actions to strengthen them. We know what buttons to push and what levers to pull, and we will do so quickly around cost, CapEx and working capital, and we will continue to proactively adjust our business to current market conditions. We know that the industry will recover. It may look different when it does, but we believe the actions we are taking will ensure that we are in a strong position, financially and structurally, to take advantage of the market’s eventual recovery. And now, let’s open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Sean Meakim: So, Jeff, I hope we could start with capital allocation and the dividend. Given the forward outlook, the uncertainties, $600 million a year staying on the balance sheet seems pretty useful. I appreciate you have no intention to take on leverage to fund the dividend. You probably have pretty decent free cash this year to cover the dividend, I think especially with working capital benefit. But on a run rate basis, maybe that looks a lot harder exiting 2020. Just I appreciate any additional comments you have about the Board’s decision making on the dividend. And with respect to timing, how to think about that?
Jeff Miller: Well, look -- thank you, Sean. Yes, I've described how we think about the dividend in the prepared remarks. And so, look, we will review the dividend with our Board, we do that quarterly. We have a Board meeting coming up in May and we'll update you on any decisions, when we get to that point.
Sean Meakim: Okay. Fair enough. And then on the $1 billion cost out plan, maybe could you just compare and contrast this initiative relative to the prior $300 million program? I'm just thinking about variable versus fixed costs that you referenced that I think largely this is an overhead cost reduction so perhaps that's more fixed -- maybe the split between North America and international. It would be great to get any more detail you can offer us on that program please?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, quite -- it's fixed costs that are coming out. I guess to compare and contrast, we took out $300 million in the fourth quarter of last year. That was largely -- that was fixed cost as we approached the business. I described this cost reduction similarly, because it is not the variable item. So I guess it's overhead and it’s things that are fixed, it’s things that take big steps down when you take them out, you don't necessarily add them back, in contrast to crews and the equipment on location and the supplies and all of the things that go with that. So a lot of that -- a lot of our strategy around North America really had been to accelerate our ability to make those decisions and take costs out quickly. These types of fixed costs, again, it's a layer of management, it's a lot of the discretionary things that we take out that we don't -- that aren't required to add back at any point. 
Lance Loeffler: And I would add, Sean, that these costs, as you asked about the split between sort of North America and international, I think these are predominantly aimed at North America, but they also include international cost-cutting as well.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
James West: Hey, Jeff, I wanted to touch on more of a bigger picture question and it relates to something you said right at the end of your prepared comments. And I certainly agree with you that the industry is going to look a whole lot different as you get through this downturn in the next couple of quarters. While that’ll be interesting to watch, are going to cause a major shakeout, which will be a net winner of. I think there are two things and maybe we touched on a little bit in prepared comments but I would like to explore a little more is your deceleration of your delivery strategy in North America and the digital transformation of the industry. Because those things I think are the most important for Halliburton and for the industry quite frankly going forward on what the industry looks like, whether it's a couple quarters or more from today's levels and then?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, James. A fantastic question. And the current environment really accelerates or allows us to really test the art of the possible with respect to how we work and digital is front and center. And I can see, when we embrace that wholeheartedly as opposed to incrementally, we're able to do things quite differently in terms of less people, less footprint, actually working more effectively in my view. But it really does require divorcing the mind of what a lot of us grew up doing to make that step to, wow, this is all possible without you fill in the blank. All of the things we thought were required to actually execute this work. And so, look, this whole period is awful on a lot of different fronts. But I am an optimist and I think we take advantage of an -- time like this and say “Okay, forget everything you thought you knew.” First and foremost, service quality and safety. Everything else, let's go relook at given the robust set of tools that we have. And a lot of these are tools that we've invented at Halliburton or they're built off of our own native cloud platforms. And so from that respect, that makes it very, very sticky as it -- we come out of this. 
James West: And Jeff, are you seeing a embrace from the -- I mean I know it’s early days in the downturn but are inbounds from customers around the digital offerings you have, have they already started to show an increase as they look to lower their costs or embrace this new paradigm? Or is it happening yet? 
Jeff Miller: Actually it is. We've seen a meaningful uptick just in the last 30 days in demand for native cloud services and apps and things that would allow not just working remotely but take the same kind of cost removal that I'm describing, our customers do that when they adopt cloud technology, a lot of what Landmark and our digital organization has been building and has on the shelf. And so it's really -- it's accelerated the demand for that. And obviously necessity is the mother of demand creation in that regard. But quite encouraging to me and actually as I said in my remarks, I'm actually more convinced today than ever that digitalization and the Landmark and then the broader digital platform we have will just serve us better in the future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Your line is now open. 
Bill Herbert: Hey Lance, with regard to working capital, if I looked at the last couple of downturns or actually the last downturn, 2015, a huge source of cash with regard to working capital, harvest about a $1 billion, it was front and loaded. 2016 was another $1.2 billion backend loaded. Question is, is that order of magnitude expected to be this time around in 2020? And when does -- and walk us through in terms of the sort of evolution of the working capital harvest this year. Is it second half weighted or does it start to inflect in the second quarter? 
Lance Loeffler: Yes, Bill. Thanks for the question. You're right. Historically we have generated cash from working capital during the last three downturns. I would say on the absolute amounts probably a little bit different profile than particularly the 2015 comparison that you were referencing, just given the fact that on an absolute basis our receivables and inventory are at levels that they were coming off of 2014 record level of revenue. So that's a little bit different, but I still expect the relative behavior to be the same. We should continue to see as the business shrinks over the next three quarters that we continue to generate a cash from working capital in the unwind. 
Bill Herbert: And then Jeff with regard to pulling forward the art of the possible in terms of digital automation, remote operations, what percentage reduction do you think that would result in with regard to your average crew size? 
Jeff Miller: Well, I think it could be in the range of half. I mean it is meaningful. But it's not the crews, it's partly crew size, but it's really all of the things that are in between the crew and sort of the overhead of the company. There are a lot of steps that involve designing work and how work gets actually prepared for delivery, the delivery of products and materials. The ability to embrace the automation of all of that is pretty meaningful. I think crew size can come down as well because there are a few things around the crew that are required to deliver all of that input. But I think the more impactful part will be all of the sort of transaction friction between sort of the top of the organization in there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Angie Sedita: So Lance, maybe I'll start with you. I -- it’s impressive the debt reduction and I know it's a focus of both you and Jeff, so maybe you could talk a little bit further about the steps that you're taking around showing up your balance sheet? Obviously you've reduced the $500 million, you pushed out maturities. I think you have another $685 million due in '21. So maybe you can talk about tendering maturities and just talk about free cash flow? 
Lance Loeffler: Yes, Angie. As we said sort of on the prepared remarks, our expectation is that we retire the $685 million that comes due next year through the free cash flow generation that we would expect to achieve this year, but roughly a $200 million coming due in February of next year and the remainder in November. And so we think that we've got ample capacity to pay debt down. And the focus philosophically for Jeff and I is to continue to reduce debt at this company and that's what we're going to continue to chase. 
Angie Sedita: And then maybe Jeff, I mean you made a remark in your prepared comments around flight to quality and clearly we've seen this bifurcation in the market. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the flight to quality in North America and what you're seeing so far? Are you seeing that actually playing out in Q2 or is that a bigger factor there when you see a recovery? And just incremental color around C&P and D&E with regard to Q2 and Q3 in the case of the downturn as we go through the rest of the year? 
Jeff Miller: Yes, Angie, look, I fully expect we see a flight to quality, but at this very moment there's just not a lot of thought going into anything other than reducing capital spend right now. And so in that kind of environment, there isn't much flight because there's not a lot of new things being added. I’m fully confident and our operating capability and the quality of the service we deliver and we maintain that front and center and fully expect the sort of after the industry is able to take a collective breath, we will be extremely well positioned and see the same flight to quality that we've always seen. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citi. Your line is now open.
Scott Gruber: How should we think about your strategic initiatives in expanding international share in lifts, chemicals, directional and information evaluation in light of the CapEx cuts and market conditions? 
Jeff Miller: Well, we -- look, we think that's an important avenue of growth about those businesses to do that. The early work around trials in a number of countries continues on. It doesn't take much capital to get that going and continue that strategic push into those markets albeit I don't think we'll see the same growth that we had anticipated. It's more a matter of pushing those services or delivering those services through the existing infrastructure that we have. So, to continue that strategic initiative is one that we bought those businesses in order to do that. Obviously, we'd like to see better market for those services as we do this. But it doesn't change the fundamental interest and actually opportunity to continue to do the things required to grow those businesses. It takes many steps to grow those businesses internationally and we don't have to stop those.
Scott Gruber: And just circling back to Angie's question, I know the outlook internationally is very opaque, but could you see the vast majority of that annual activity hit in 2Q, and then the second half maybe be more flattish just given a fading impact from COVID offset by the growing impact from the customer CapEx reductions where we’re likely to see activity continue to step down in the second half of the year?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean, I think we will see most of the U.S. impact in Q2. I mean that's just -- it's moving so quickly that our view on the U.S. is that we see dramatic reduction in Q2, though not able to call a precise number or timing and then likely kind of works off the rest of the year, the -- flattish. The international market reacts a little differently and I just say that because taking a frac holiday is a lot different than taking a deepwater rig holiday. They just happen at different paces. And so, we've got a view of slowing activity internationally. It doesn't necessarily slow at the same pace that we see it, just because they pick a day, it's like we're going to stop on X date, but it's not today. It's at a point in time. And so, I think that unwind is over more than just Q2, albeit the COVID-19 disruption part should get behind us quickly. It's the same operators that are conserving capital in the U.S., in many cases are the operators that will look to conserve capital internationally. NOCs, if we had a grade level of how effective or impactful, NOCs would be less impacted, probably IOCs more so internationally over the balance of the year. But all of that, we'll have better visibility of that as we go through Q2.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill from Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Chase Mulvehill: So, I guess if we can kind of come back to the U.S. a little bit, obviously 2Q is -- you’re going to take a significant step down. But if we think about your overall strategy for U.S. onshore during this downturn, do you think that you may be focused a little bit more or a little bit less on market share this downturn relative to kind of how you were thinking a couple of months ago?
Jeff Miller: Look, our playbook doesn't change going into this current environment. By that I mean, returns are front and center, albeit challenged, but we're not chasing market share, don't intend to. I don't think that the dynamics have changed. The things that form our view on our strategy for North America haven't changed, the bigger full cycle type things. And so therefore, we're going to manage our costs. We're going to look at the returns on equipment, the best utilization of equipment, whether that's to stack it or work at. But we don't believe that anyone working below EBIT or EBITDA is not going to be successful in the long-term and we plan to be very successful in the long-term. And so, we haven't changed our view there. Flight to quality may result in more market share at some point, but trust me that is not -- and we don't go-to-market thinking about that. 
Chase Mulvehill: If I can kind of a switch over to international a little bit, and this has kind of been touched on throughout the Q&A session. But you talked about international CapEx, E&P CapEx being down about 10% year-over-year. OPEC+ members are talking about actually holding 6 million barrels a day of production offline through basically April 2022. So, if they end up doing this, can you talk about the medium term activity outlook for international? Last cycle we were down kind of 40%, it seemed like on international Drilling and Completion spending. Do you think that it will be better or worse, all set and done if OPEC+ does hold this amount of production offline through 2022?
Jeff Miller: Chase, look, I think that's the kind of clarity we will likely get as we work through Q2. But we just don't -- with respect to OPEC+, I think overall they will be more resilient than the rest of the market, almost independent of what impact the recent agreements have or don't have on activity. The market never really recovered from ‘16 other than nominally. So if it would be hard to follow the same distance. Though, like I said, I think we'll get that clarity as we work through Q1, I said in the range of 10% simply because it can be plus or minus something around that band.  I think we've got -- we'll have a better sense in North America as we get through Q2. I think we'll have visibility, but without all of the certainty as we get through Q2. Again, just because those are slower developing, the decisions are slower developing internationally to a degree just because they have to and there's too many partners, nations, governments, things involved to move at the same pace that a North America nimble independent operator can move. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Your line is now open.
David Anderson: A question on sort of -- I certainly appreciate the lack of visibility in North America. I don't think that's a surprise to anybody. But your customers are all in various states of health as well, if I think about the majors versus E&Ps versus these privates that are out there. Can you just talk about how those discussions are going and maybe the differences that you see in how those customers are behaving now? I know it just seems like to us on the other side it's all sort of coming at as fast and furious, but if you could maybe segregate how those different customers are behaving and what they're talking to you about that'd be very helpful? 
Jeff Miller: Look, I think, they're all behaving in the very near term quite similarly. I think they all have a view and I'm not going to just differentiate between the financial position of the market or the different parts of the market. So I would say that's an incredibly aggressive group of competitors. My clients I'm talking about in North America and they're going to each aggressively act independently. The dialogue with them at least with me has been disappointment over the near term, but all, they bit firmly in their teeth looking ahead to what it looks like on the other side. And the dialogue is always that we're going to need to be super competitive and work with Halliburton when we get to the other side. We've had many discussions about what does a recovery or how do we implement the things we're talking about on the other side. So that's generally been a consistent conversation with all customers. 
David Anderson: And a separate question on the international side. You said in your remarks, it sounds like the direct impact from the pandemic is mostly to international operations, supply chain, kind of quarantine, having trouble moving people around. Are you seeing the same thing in the U.S.? I haven't really heard that much about that or is it just the fact that the equip activity is falling so fast that you're not really seeing it, it’s somewhat irrelevant? Can you just talk about kind of the more direct impacts of this pandemic to your operations on the U.S. side? 
Jeff Miller: Yes, we’re seeing less of the direct impact just because the workforce is all U.S. Most of the travel can be done in a car, not on a plane. So most of the supply chain is North America based.  It's a very little that we actually source outside the U.S. and so I think that's the reason more than any other that we don't see the disruption in the U.S. and obviously we see the commodity price impact in the U.S. But internationally, even if it's not a U.S.-based workforce, we have a very globally based workforce with 140 nations that work for Halliburton and most of those international. So that's where we get into some of that supply chain.  Well, people interruption though, let me compliment our international folks and operations. I mean they ramped up very quickly. The interruptions to this point have been very limited and it’s because that group has literally sprung to action to manage. I just can't tell you how many people moves and supply chain moves that they've overcome. 
David Anderson: So does that give you a little bit of comfort in the second part of the year for international that if you are more impacted today from the pandemic, but as that eases, maybe that gives you a little bit of help in the back part of the year? 
Jeff Miller: Well I think the COVID interruption part, it gives me a lot of confidence around our ability to find an operating rhythm which our team typically does and does quite well. But I would say that, that does -- the commodity price impact is what we will see as I’ve described earlier, Dave, working through Q2 and what it might mean. Again, I think in the range of 10% which our initial thoughts had been up and now we're talking about down 10% or so in that range. But I think that clarity -- we really don't get that clarity until it settles in.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Your line is now open.
Kurt Hallead: So, Jeff, you spent quite a bit of time on the last conference call talking about the digital dynamic, obviously a reference again and emphasized it today. I think last time we had a discussion, you indicated maybe the digital dynamic might not have a very near-term -- big near-term impact on revenue generation. So just wanted to kind a touch base again and given all the disruption that's happened in the industry, given the commentary you’ve made about a number of different discussions now being had and rethinking and reshaping the industry going forward, any updates or any thoughts on how much revenue digital could potentially push, whether it's this year or whether you think it's going to get accelerated as you go into next year as well? 
Jeff Miller: Well, look, I think it accelerates as I have described. I don't think any revenue is accelerating at this very moment, albeit we are seeing a meaningful uptick in new users just over the last 30 days. As I said, in our iEnergy cloud, which has been meaningful, but overall hard to describe revenues up in a meaningful way at least right now. That said, though, the ability to reduce cost by implementing these things is in the here and the now. I mean that is like here and the now this week having an impact. And so I think the ability, for example, on our integrated projects as we -- this accelerates the acceptance by customers and the demand even by our own people to implement those tools that de-man rigs, work remotely, all of those are tools that we've been building over the last several years. We've implemented them or we've talked about them, in the North Sea, with Aker BP and some others who've been quite vocal but we've done it with many others. So it's hard to look at that set of tools today and not ask yourself, “Why am I not using those tools today?” And so I'm really encouraged about the pace we will see.  I think we'll actually see -- its impact will be still over the next few years as that continues to grow, but the existing tools get adopted quite quickly I think in this market. 
Kurt Hallead: Great. Thanks for that color Jeff. And maybe a follow-up here for Lance. In prior cycle downturns, typically the decremental margin associated with this down cycle could be anywhere in, let's just call it 40% or so. I know you guys aren’t giving any specific guidance and I appreciate that dynamic. But just trying to think through this element of, if we're coming through this down cycle at kind of lower price points for U.S. frac, didn't really kind of get the same pricing on the international dynamic through this last upturn. Should we still be thinking about maybe baseline to 40% decrementals or should it be lower? And then in that same context, once we come up with that decremental dynamic, I'm assuming we add back $1 billion of that cost savings to whatever we calculate. Is that -- Lance, is that a fair way to think about it?
Lance Loeffler : Yes, I think it is a fair way to think about it. And I won't try to pick an exact number in terms of decrementals in this cycle. But what I will tell you is, is that we're taking out cost now to buoy those decrementals, to soften those decrementals throughout the full cycle of this downturn. I mean, that's the purpose, that's what we're aiming toward. That comes in the form of lowering our unit costs and ultimately doing everything that we can to improve our operating leverage. So, yes, I mean I think that the way that you're thinking about it, if you had an assumption around decrementals, the fit -- the overhead and other costs that we announced, the $1 billion, which is an addition to the $300 million that we've already taken out in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year-- fourth quarter of last year, first quarter of this year --we expect those to be impactful and to soften the decrementals in this downturn.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller : Yes. Thank you, Gigi. Before we wrap up the call, I'd like to leave you with a few closing comments. First, I thank the Halliburton employees for their dedication to safe, reliable service through these difficult times. I have the utmost confidence in their ability to deliver our value proposition, under any conditions. Second, our balance sheet and liquidity position are solid, and we plan to continue taking actions to strengthen them. We are taking swift actions to address cost, CapEx and working capital, and we'll continue to proactively adjust our business to current market conditions. Finally, we know the industry will recover and believe the actions we are taking will ensure that we are in a strong position, financially and structurally, to take advantage of the markets eventual recovery. Look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Gigi, please close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining, and have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-01-21 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I’d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Abu Zeya. Please go ahead, sir.

After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. 2019 solidified the pivot from growth to capital discipline in North America and marked another step on the road to recovery in the international markets. I’m pleased with the way the Halliburton team executed our value proposition, delivered exceptional safety and service quality and stayed focused on generating healthy returns and strong free cash flow. I thank our outstanding Halliburton employees for their hard work and execution the entire year. 2020 opens a new decade and a new century for Halliburton. It brings new opportunities that I will address in a few minutes. But first, some headlines for the full-year and fourth quarter of 2019. We finished 2019 with total Company revenue of $22 billion and adjusted operating income of $2.1 billion. I'm pleased with the continued recovery in our international business. We increased revenue 10%, outgrowing the international rig count for the second year in a row. North America revenue declined 18% as a result of customer activity and pricing reductions and our decision to focus on those customers that provide the best returns. Systematically improving our service delivery, immediate cost reductions and the growth in non-frac product lines allowed us to stem the margin erosion. We delivered over $900 million of free cash flow for the full year, demonstrating our ability to generate consistent free cash flow, throughout different business environments. Finally, 2019 was an exceptional year for our safety and service quality performance. Our total recordable incident rate and nonproductive time, both improved by over 20%, historical bests across our business. This is a result of our employees’ continued commitment to safety and process execution. And now, a few points about the fourth quarter. We finished the quarter with total Company revenue of $5.2 billion, a 6% sequential decrease and adjusted operating income of $546 million, an increase of 2% quarter-over-quarter. Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 13% sequentially and operating margin remained essentially flat. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered a strong quarter. We grew revenue 4% and improved operating margin 300 basis points sequentially. D&E international margins grew significantly, offset by margin decline in North America. While our North America business declined due to the significantly lower activity in U.S. land, internationally, we delivered 10% revenue growth this quarter. This underscores the versatility and global reach of our business. In the fourth quarter, we took a $2.2 billion, largely non-cash impairment charge and made strategic decisions to market for sale our pipeline services and well control product lines. As I mentioned, 2020 brings plenty of opportunities. The oil price is more constructive as we enter the year. The imminent global recession fears have abated with the help of economic easing from the leading central banks. U.S. production growth is slowing because of constricted capital flows. The increase in non-U.S. non-OPEC supply coming into the market is limited. The geopolitical instability in the key oil-producing regions of the world should add an incremental risk premium to the commodity prices in the near term. That said, oil prices are still supported by the OPEC plus cuts and will fluctuate based on the group’s resolve to continue limiting production. Gas prices in the U.S. are below breakeven levels. U.S. drilling and completions activity may be biased lower due to the consolidation and restricted access to capital. Halliburton is no stranger to navigating choppy waters. We entered 2020 and our next century with a clear sense of purpose. We will continue to do what we do best, collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize our customers’ asset value while generating industry-leading returns and sustainable cash flow for our shareholders. We will do this with attention to the sustainability of our business, minimizing environmental impacts and acting as a responsible corporate citizen. The international markets presented plenty of growth opportunities in 2019. We grew revenue 10% year-over-year, closing stronger than anticipated. All regions increased revenue, led by Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe. Both our divisions meaningfully contributed to the international growth, Completion and Production led the charge with 13% expansion due to higher activity in mature fields in Europe and unconventionals in Argentina, the UAE and Australia. Drilling and Evaluation grew international revenues 8% as we increased activity levels in all markets, specifically in Norway, Mexico, China, and Nigeria. In 2020, we expect the international spend by our customers to increase by mid single digits, making it the third consecutive year of spending growth. We have the right footprint and an enhanced technology portfolio to compete and win across the international markets. We expect to grow at or above the market rate this year, consistently focusing on profitable growth and improving our international margins. Continued gas activity expansion in the Middle East, resolution of political issues in Latin America, and several pending project awards may enable us to outgrow the market again in 2020. Our Drilling and Evaluation division is poised to grow faster as we get the benefit of the full year in our Norway integrated contracts, the iCruise directional drilling platform rollout continues, and new offshore drilling activity starts up around the world. The international revenue growth should follow the historical cyclicality. In the first quarter, we expect international revenue to decline due to normal seasonality and the elimination of yearend sales. Thereafter, we should see steady growth that would peak in the fourth quarter. This year, we expect to increase our international margins. We anticipate higher utilization for our existing equipment in busy markets like the North Sea and Asia Pacific. Our project pipeline is strong, and the incremental activity will help tighten tool availability and absorb the existing cost structure. We intend to be prudent with capital allocation, driving our organization to have the right pricing discussions with customers. Given the tool tightness in some product lines and geographies, we're strategically reallocating assets to the best returning opportunities. Pricing in certain international regions is improving and we expect this momentum to continue throughout 2020. About one-third of our book of business is awarded every year. The remaining two thirds are existing contracts and contract extensions. We are gaining pricing traction on new work and contract renewals, and we're making strategic choices about the work we pursue. I believe the capital and pricing discipline across all geographies will allow Halliburton to deliver rational returns-driven growth in the international markets. Turning to North America. The U.S. shale industry is facing its biggest test since the 2015 downturn with both capital discipline and slowing leading edge efficiency gains weighing down activity and production. As expected in the fourth quarter, customer activity declined across all basins in North America land, affecting both, our drilling and completions businesses. The rig count in U.S. land contracted 11% sequentially and completed stages had the largest drop we have seen in recent history. While holidays and weather were the usual factors, other reasons for this air pocket in activity included our customers’ free cash flow generation commitments and an oversupply of gas market. With this backdrop, Halliburton followed our playbook and continued to proactively manage our fleet count. As announced last quarter, we also proactively cut costs and started the implementation of the strategy to sustainably improve our service delivery. Those actions allowed us to curb margin declines in North America and deliver lower decrementals year-on-year, even though the industry’s sequential activity drop was much more severe than in the fourth quarter of 2018. In the fourth quarter, the market saw clear public evidence of the long-awaited equipment attrition. This is just the beginning. We believe a lot more equipment will exit the market as lower demand, increasing service intensity and insufficient returns take their toll. As service companies cannibalize idle equipment for parts and new sideline pumps to beef up working fleets, the available horsepower supply in the market may be smaller than something. Halliburton has continued doing what we said we were doing, stacking equipment to improve our returns. We exited 2019 with 22% less available fracturing horsepower. We have rationalized our equipment supply to the anticipated level of demand in 2020. The size and scale of our business in North America gave us the ability to right size without sacrificing our market leadership position and the value that comes with it. In the fourth quarter, we started the implementation of our $300 million annualized cost savings and service delivery improvement strategy. We moved quickly to execute the initial personnel reductions and real estate rationalization all with an eye to improving our near-term financial performance. We’ve achieved about $200 million in savings on a run rate basis in the fourth quarter. While this impacts our business globally, the majority of the savings are geared towards North America. We're looking at 2020 with pragmatism. Early indications are that are U.S. land customers will reduce capital spending approximately 10% from 2019 levels. I believe that the current level of ducks in the market will allow operators to spend less money on new well construction and direct more of it to completions. Depressed gas pricing is negatively affecting the activity outlook in the gassy basins, which will likely bear brunt of the activity reductions in 2020. In the first quarter operators will reload their budgets, and we expect modest improvement in completions activity as a result. That said, the calendar cadence where some operators are biased to spend more-earlier in the year, will likely remain. Halliburton will continue to be proactive in taking actions to generate industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow in this environment. Here are the more significant actions. After systematically rationalizing equipment in 2019 to adjust to changing activity levels, in 2020, we plan to provide the capacity that maximizes the returns on our overall fleet. This should also allow us to be efficient about our workforce and maintenance planning and to achieve higher utilization of existing fleets throughout the year. Pricing pressure was considerable during the year-end tendering season. Consistent with our capital discipline approach, we've taken on contracts that are expected to allow our portfolio to earn acceptable returns and declined those that are not. I like the slice of the market that we’re choosing to participate in this year. Our high-graded customer portfolio gives us confidence in a more sustainable demand level and the mix of pricing and volume that generates returns for Halliburton. Make no mistake, we will continue developing technologies whose value accrues to Halliburton and not just to our customers. Our integrated completions offering and the iCruise rotary steerable system are prime examples of such technologies. They should allow us to reduce our capital outlay and deliver better margins, all with the purpose of generating strong returns. We plan to continue strategically growing our share of services per well, by increasing the competitiveness of our non-hydraulic fracturing businesses in North America. Our wireline and perforating, artificial lift and specialty chemical product lines, all posted strong double-digit revenue growth in 2019, despite the overall market softness in U.S. land. We intend to keep this momentum and spread it to other services. Finally, we will continue the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy. Halliburton is redesigning the way we deliver our fracturing services in order to lower our unit costs and improve margins and returns in the long run. 2019 closed the decade of the shale revolution that transformed the United States into the world's top hydrocarbon producer. Halliburton was an early participant in this development and has been investing in it and innovating ever since hand-in-hand with our customers. As unconventionals enter maturation phase, Halliburton is committed to the North American market and taking appropriate actions to thrive in the new environment. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Then, I will return to discuss digitalization, a topic that will define the next decade for our industry. Lance?
Lance Loeffler: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Let's begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results, compared to the third quarter of 2019. Total Company revenue for the quarter was $5.2 billion, a decrease of 6% and adjusted operating income was $546 million, an increase of 2%. During the fourth quarter, we recognized $2.2 billion of pretax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted largely of non-cash asset impairments, mostly associated with pressure pumping and legacy drilling equipment. They also included approximately a $100 million of cash costs, primarily related to severance. As a result of the charge, in the fourth quarter, we recognized a benefit of approximately $35 million from a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense, which reflects two months of DD&A impact. The after-tax impact of this reduction in the fourth quarter is approximately $0.03 of EPS, of which $0.02 is included in our Completion and Production results and the remainder in Drilling and Evaluation numbers. As Jeff mentioned, we've also accomplished a significant portion of our intended annualized cost reductions with the remainder to come in the first quarter. Let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3.1 billion, while operating income was $387 million, both decreased 13%. Reduced activity and pricing in multiple product service lines, primarily associated with stimulation services in North America land, coupled with lower activity for stimulation services in Latin America and well intervention services in the Middle East drove our results. These declines were partially offset by higher pressure pumping activity in the Eastern hemisphere, coupled with year-end completion tool sales globally. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 4%, while operating income was $224 million, an increase of 49%. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in all product service lines in the Middle East/Asia, coupled with higher drilling activity in Europe/Africa/CIS, and yearend software sales globally. These improvements were partially offset by lower drilling activity in North America and reduced testing activity in Latin America. Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue was $2.3 billion, a 21% decrease. This decline was mainly due to lower activity and pricing in North America land, primarily associated with pressure pumping and well construction. This decline was partially offset by higher yearend completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. In Latin America, revenue was $598 million, a 2% decrease, resulting primarily from lower activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina coupled with decreased testing activity across the region. These results were partially offset by higher activity for all product service lines in Colombia, increased project management activity and cloud infrastructure installations in Mexico and higher yearend completion tool sales across the region. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. Revenue was $883 million, a 6% increase, resulting primarily from increased well construction activity in the North Sea, coupled with increased activity in multiple product service lines in Algeria. These improvements were partially offset by lower pipeline services across the region. In Middle East/Asia, revenue was $1.4 billion, a 19% increase sequentially, largely resulting from increased activity in multiple product service lines across the Middle East, India and China, higher pressure pumping activity in Australasia and higher year-end incompletion tool sales across the region. These results were partially offset by lower well intervention services in the Middle East. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $65 million, and we expect it to be the same in the first quarter of 2020. Net interest expense for the quarter was $141 million and should remain approximately the same for the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 22%. Based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix, we expect our 2020 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 21% with a projected full-year tax rate of approximately 23%. We earned approximately $1.2 billion of cash from operations during the fourth quarter. As expected, we improved our working capital and generated strong free cash flow of approximately $827 million for the quarter, delivering approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year, excluding the cash impact of the restructuring charges I discussed earlier. As a result, we ended the year with $2.3 billion in cash. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $340 million with our 2019 full year CapEx ending just above $1.5 billion. As we look ahead to this year, we intend to reduce our capital expenditures by approximately 20% to $1.2 billion. We believe this level of spend will still allow us to invest in our anticipated international growth while continuing to rationalize our business to the current market conditions in North America. Within this reduced CapEx budget, we will continue investing in and growing our production group businesses, namely constructing a chemical manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia and expanding our artificial lift footprint. We will also move forward with the iCruise system global rollout, but at a more normalized pace than what we accomplished over the last couple of years. Our digital efforts and new technologies aimed at improving our efficiency and reducing our operating costs will also get an appropriate share of spend. We believe our capital allocation decisions are consistent with our focus on generating strong cash flow for our investors, regardless of the market environment. Finally, let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out. As is typical, our results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of year-end sales, which will mostly impact our international business. North America will see a modest increase in completions activity, as Jeff described earlier. We will continue to pull the levers that allow us to mitigate margin declines across the business this quarter. As such, in our Completion and Production division, we expect sequential revenue to increase 2% to 4% with margins declining 125 to 150 basis points. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue will decline 4% to 6% with margins decreasing 200 to 250 basis points. I'll now turn the call back over to Jeff. Jeff?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Lance. One of the key trends that will define the new decade in our industry is digitalization. The next 10 years will see digital technologies and artificial intelligence going mainstream, just like the smartphones did in the last second. In the oil and gas industry, digitalization unlocks the potential to structurally lower cost, shorten the time to first oil, increase optionality in exploration and production, and enhance performance across the entire value chain. Digital is not a separate strategy at Halliburton, rather it is an integral part of our value proposition. Our ability to collaborate engineered solutions and maximize customers’ asset value is evolving through the seamless integration of digital technologies into our operations. Digital permeates everything we do and has the same goal as our business strategy, deliver value for our customers and returns for our shareholders. At Halliburton, we are hard at work on the next frontier solutions that will shift the balance in the people, process, technology triad by replacing labor and reducing capital investments through automation and self learning processes. We believe this will allow us to harness the transformative power of digitalization and make a quantum leap in productivity, similar to going from horses to horsepower. It takes time to build the scalable software and hardware infrastructure required to fully capitalize on digital solutions. We're well along that path and have been building up our digital capabilities for a number of years with the long-term view of how digitalization will evolve. I'm pleased with the internal and customer adoption we’re seeing. Halliburton is in a unique position to reap the benefits of the industry's move towards digitalization. Our Landmark product line is an established leader in petrotechnical software with the powerful cloud-enabled DecisionSpace 365 software platform. In 2019, the cloud-native software was our fastest growing business within Landmark, increasing revenues 50% year-over-year. Landmark provides us with solid foundation, established through decades of investment in software development, people, domain expertise and processes to create and scale digital solutions. This benefits all of our product lines. In addition, we have strategic partnerships with Accenture, Microsoft, AWS and Schneider Electric, all of which validate and expand both our vision and our capabilities. We now have over 100 customers with thousands of users across the globe, leveraging our iEnergy digital ecosystem to integrated software and workflows across their organizations, regardless if they're Halliburton's, third-party or internally developed. This open architecture platform is unique in the industry and in our view is a necessary condition for the successful adoption and scaling of digital solutions. True to our D&A, we are also bringing to market practical, smart and interconnected products and services that help unlock value for us and our customers. We are pioneering new approaches to subsurface understanding, well construction and reservoir recovery. Let me spend a few minutes on each. First, we transformed subsurface understanding using big data, digital frameworks and evergreen models. We've created a unique geological model of the entire earth to provide insights into the origin and productivity of reservoir. Once drilling starts, we deliver improved field measurements with next-generation wireline and logging-while-drilling tools, fiber and sensors. We then translate these measurements into faster and more informed decision-making using a new class of models made possible by digital technologies. For example, our EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity sensor automatically feeds into our industry first, scalable earth model that updates in real time. Customers can now make faster decisions about their development programs and reduce cycle times by a factor of 10. Second, we improve well construction through collaborative well engineering and drilling automation. Landmark’s digital well program enables seamless collaboration between operators and service companies across a multitude of software platforms. The iCruise drilling system increases the number of built-in sensors by a factor of 5 and offers self guiding capabilities. Working with our rig partners, our digital twin technology delivers better collaboration and faster decision-making. All of these solutions boost efficiencies and lower costs, while demanning the process of well construction. Last but not least, we improved recovery and production by using our digitally enabled tools to connect customers’ assets and leveraging this to monitor and enhance performance outcomes. In completions, we use our intelligent completions for monitoring production trends and connecting them to broader reservoir management studies. In artificial lift, we leveraged digital to monitor ESP health and extend run life. In simulation, we use our industry-leading fracture modeling software and full-scale asset simulator to model fracture propagation and frac hits. These are examples of how we deliver digital innovation today, with a focus on specific domains and aligned with the customers’ buying behavior. They provide immediate value to customers, increased customer loyalty and generate returns for Halliburton. Over time, we believe digitalization will seamlessly connect subsurface, drilling and production, enabling customers to make asset-level decisions at the speed of execution. We have a solid foundation, the tools, the open architecture and the domain expertise to successfully deliver this vision. Let me summarize what we’ve talked about today. In 2020, Halliburton is focused on delivering margin expansion, industry-leading returns and strong free cash flow. In our view, international growth will continue. Increased activity, disciplined capital allocation, pricing improvements and our ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services we believe will lead to international margin expansion in 2020. As North America customer spending declines again this year, Halliburton will continue to execute our playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow. We plan to provide the service capacity that we believe will maximize the returns on our overall fleet, continue to invest in technologies that improve margins, keep strategically growing our non-hydraulic fracturing product service line and continue the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy. We believe digitalization will define this decade in our industry. Halliburton continues to move full steam ahead on the digital journey and is uniquely positioned to reap its benefits. And now, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
James West: So, Jeff, towards the end of your prepared comments, you've talked a lot about international and international margin progression. I wonder, if we could dig into a little more detail there with mid single digit it sounds like growth, you may be able to outpace that a touch here as well, plus you're seeing some pockets of pricing strength. How should we think about the margin expansion as we go through the year, what type of incremental should we be expecting? 
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, James. Look, I think I spent a fair amount of time on the catalysts themselves, obviously activity improving, rational project choices and technologies. I think, the key is, it's going to be shaped -- we're starting at a higher point going into Q1 than we certainly did last year. And then, I would expect the shape of that to look similar where we start and it moves up a little, just that shape of the international margins should stay consistent, but obviously starting from a higher point.
James West: And then, maybe for Lance here on the free cash flow next year, looks like it's going to be pretty significant based on some growth but also lower CapEx here. How should we think about when we're going to see the free cash flow start to show up, will it be similar to this year, or it should be backend loaded, or would it be more even throughout the year?
Lance Loeffler: Yes. Look, I think you're right in terms of the expectations to grow free cash flow this year. You're right around the -- I don't think that the -- our ability to drive sort of the working capital consumption is going to remain in the first half of the year like it has historically for us. I expect some of the extreme volatility that we saw last year to not repeat this year, but there still is a consumption of cash from a working capital perspective. But overall with the reduction in CapEx, the improvement around margins and some stability around our working capital, we expect free cash flow to grow in 2020.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Sean Meakim: So, you touched on the margin progression internationally. Can you maybe just talk about how that translates into D&E in 2020? So, we had the margin ramp in 4Q, maybe 70 basis points or so comes from the D&E benefit that will help year-on-year in ‘20. But, can we see 2020 margins on a full-year basis get back to 2017, 2018 levels? Do we think we can get back to a double digit type of outcome for the year? I’m just curious how you think investors will get comfortable with the trajectory like that, just given it’s been a difficult business to forecast last couple of years?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Sean, it has been difficult to forecast, but we've done a lot of things during that time. So, the platform around iCruise technology and EarthStar has been rolling out at the same time. We're seeing a lot of international choppiness that we see some recovery sort of happening, which obviously lends itself towards D&E. And so, I think these are multi-year efforts that we -- and we view them that way. I’d say digital as well will contribute to probably early days to D&E. For all of those reasons, I don't think it's unreasonable also to expect that we get back to I think 2018 looking kind of number or beyond.
Sean Meakim: Got it, okay. Thank you for that. And then, so on the digital strategy, competitors made a lot more noise about their strategy maybe than you have so far. But the [indiscernible] contracts sound pretty similar in terms of the offering. Could you maybe just expand a little bit in terms of the scalability that you see for those types of avenues maybe across a broader set of customers and where you see the most opportunity?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I think I tried to describe today our vision around digital and then the mechanics for realizing that vision, which then quickly becomes in today's market what are the things we actually do. So, I used an example of some of the tools that are in the market. As we integrate those, obviously the moat expands around those. So, I think, it will take many forms over time. Again, it will be big projects, which we’ve talked about a few of those where it's either a cloud infrastructure and the cloud environment that we either install or operate and we’ve got examples of each of those. But equally important will be the day in, day out march around how this work really gets done, which is around drilling, production and reservoir filling in those spaces with tools, they all contribute to that vision. And so, I think that there is a lot of scalability here. And I think what's most important is really the production capital that Halliburton has invested in Landmark that really makes it scalable. In fact, to do these things at scale, there's a lot of discipline and practice and agile DevOps that are required at scale to reliably develop software and then operate, maintain and then ultimately continue to advance. And we have that. So, and I’m really confident in how that rolled out over the longer term. And I think the thing to focus on is, what are those tools that we’re doing now that deliver returns. Obviously, they contribute to the vision.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Angie Sedita: So, just on C&P specific to North America, could you talk a little bit about the cost cutting that's unwinding here? You said you have a $100 million left. Is there more that could be done beyond that $100 million? It’s for Jeff or Lance. And then, maybe you could talk also about the pricing. Have you seen the market starting to stabilize on the frac side for pricing, are you still seeing pressure in frac and across the other product lines?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, Angie. Look, the $300 million in savings, and we've moved quickly on that. And I think, the $200 million that we've taken out on an annualized basis already, expect to get the rest of that done in Q1. And I think that really speaks to how that team in North America executes. And we execute very quickly and with a lot of purpose. And so, obviously that contributes. Beyond that, we've talked about our playbook and how we expect to execute our strategy in North America. And I think over time that continues to drive improvement in margins, less concentrated in a moment, but obviously a set of activities that yield value over time. From a pricing standpoint, it’s still very -- it’s competitive information. Obviously, Q4 was quite competitive. And so, I think the market in spite of attrition is still oversupplied. What's important though is that we make our own choices around how to maximize fleet profitability. And by virtue of doing that, I view it as more stable in that respect.
Lance Loeffler: Angie, I might add a comment too on the $300 million in cost savings. Just to be clear too to add to Jeff, that's sort of cash structural savings.
Jeff Miller: Yes.
Angie Sedita: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, maybe staying along the themes on pricing. It's obviously the reverse internationally. Maybe you could talk a little bit or give more color on the pricing power or momentum you’re seeing in the international markets. Is it fairly widespread, is it by specific regions or product lines, and do you think there could be a little bit of momentum going into 2020, or is it slow and steady?
Jeff Miller: Look, I'd more describe it as slow and steady, Angie. I think, what the key is that the setup is constructive. And so, managing capital in a more prudent way, focusing on profitable growth as opposed to growth, all of those things conspire to create an environment, where we're able to get better pricing. Is it widespread, I'd say it’s generally widespread, but there is probably pockets who are more concentrated than others, sometimes driven by availability and complexity of work and things that would normally and rationally drive our pricing. And so, I think that's what we're seeing in the market. And yes, it is getting traction.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is now open.
Bill Herbert: Thank you. Good morning. Lance, you talked about it conceptually, but I'd like to kind of refine it, if you will, with regard to the discussion of the evolution of working capital for this year, less pronounced seasonal trends, you were a huge consumer, cash, working capital was in the first half of 2019 a nice contributor to cash in the second half. I'm trying to kind of peg the order of magnitude of the reduction in cash consumption during the first half of this year versus the first half of last year.
Lance Loeffler: Yes. I think, what you see, Bill is sort of a year-over-year comparison as we don't have -- I mean, last year we were carrying a lot of inventory associated with the boost in the iCruise rollout and in some of our C&P product lines that I don't think that you see that consumption taking place again this year, as we consume more of that inventory, as opposed to build it. The collection cycle is still going to be very similar. Albeit as the international business becomes a bigger part of our business that typically has longer DSOs, so we may see some impact there. But still a view where we build receivables early in the year and then unwind those as we get into the later part of the year.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And so, just to take a stab at it, would you expect that your cash consumption from working capital in the first half of this year would run it like half of what it did in 2019? I mean, is that a reasonable starting point?
Lance Loeffler: I think that's probably a reasonable starting point.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And then, secondly, again a lot of moving parts, but it's kind of a 20% reduction in CapEx, you should have better working capital improvement for this year. Net income should be up as well. So, at least from my numbers, I'm getting to kind of a free cash flow yield, assuming a $24 stock price of kind of 7% to 8%, which is getting pretty sporty. And I'm just curious with regards to priorities of the deployment of that surplus cash flow. Is it still a reduction of net debt first and foremost?
Lance Loeffler: Yes, I think it is. I think with the excess cash, I think we do have a near-term priority on reducing debt. The reality is Bill is while we're focused on that debt reduction in the near term, what it does and what it offers us as we continue to chip away at it, is give us more flexibility to return cash to shareholders in the future. And I think today, our business, we need to address the $3.8 billion of debt that we have coming due over the next six years. So, I think we'll do that -- do some of that in the near-term, but also with an eye on ultimately returning cash to shareholders.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Scott Gruber: Kind of staying on a similar line of questioning. Lance, you mentioned the $1.2 billion of CapEx in 2020, which is good to see. Could you just provide some color on how you think about the sustainability of CapEx around that level? There is a few moving pieces year-on-year in '20 and there will be a few more in '21 in particular with the Saudi chem. supplying investment now recurring. But, just how should we think about kind of broad strokes on that level of CapEx and feel free to frame it as a percent of sales, if it’s easy?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Scott, this is Jeff. I think, the key is around prioritization. And we are focused on the best returning opportunities. But, we were able to fund international growth in 2019 and expect with that level of CapEx can continue to fund the growth that we see in 2020. So, it isn't that we are starving anything. The reality is we're feeding things appropriately and around our return expectations. We think about spending this year, it's probably two thirds international, a third U.S. but in our view very sustainable. And so, we're comfortable with that level of CapEx and also what it means to making better returns.
Lance Loeffler: Yes. I would add, in an environment, an increasing pricing environment that generates the appropriate returns, we may spend more, but it will be commensurate with the focus on returns and overall driving better free cash flow.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And then, just a question, circling back on the domestic frac market. With pricing hopefully stabilizing here in early 2020, and Jeff you had mentioned a focus on maximizing returns on the frac fleet. But, broad strokes, does that strategy likely mean that your frac business trends with the market in 2020 or they had lagged the market to a degree in 2020, would be focused on returns? How should we think about it?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I think that it will -- yes, I would expect we stay consistent with the market, but we don't feel like we have to just because we mostly focus on the returns and free cash flow out of that business. But, I wouldn't think we would be out of the market at any point in time. But that said, we’re focused on the slice of customers that make the best returns for us, which gets to a number of factors, efficiency, but also calendar cadence piece of spend. This year going into Q1 for example, we’re 95% committed on the fleet, which is the best we've been since the downturn.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open.
David Anderson: Hi. Good morning. Jeff, going back to your comments on the digital side, as we move beyond the proof of concept and it becomes more broadly accepted, you kind of talked about sort of two different types of customers out there, I guess as sort of maybe on the E&P side as those who have kind of realized, they can do themselves and you provide certain discrete operations, different applications like you just mentioned on some of your tools. On the other side, you have other bigger broader customers which you can implement your ecosystem across the organization kind of the announcements you made today. How do you see those two sets of customers evolving over the next let say, next several years? Is it fair to assume just kind of the former and then the former is the majority of that business and then hopefully it kind of evolves more into more the broader implementation? Can you just talk about how you see the customers’ acceptance?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, I think customers do this at the pace at which they can digest it realistically. And that is the reason why I think you see that bifurcation today, it's more apparent just because customers that can actually operate and execute at that level of integration are fewer and far between today. And I kind of view it that way. It gets implemented at the pace it could be absorbed. That’s why I tend to talk about the vision and then bring it down to -- okay, here are the more digestible groupings being drilling, production and reservoir, and then even down into the tools. Because the reality is number of these tool don’t have to be integrated but they can be and they are more effective when integrated. And so, if I use a fairly simple example, like in EarthStar tool, it’s a tool, it’s metal, it runs in the well, it’s fantastic tool, but what's most important about it is the answer product, which is the 3D inversion. And now, that 3D inversion becomes even more valuable when integrated in an Earth model and likely yet again more valuable when integrated into the entire ecosphere. But that’s difficult for everyone to do that at one time and it's very hard to do that given sort of the proliferation of different systems. So, the key in my view is we continue to advance the platform, the ecosystem as you described it, while at the same time, driving immediate returns around these tools. And they're available to be integrated into that ecosystem. I hope that's helpful.
David Anderson: That makes, a lot of sense, Jeff. Thanks. Now, the other side of digital here is that it appears to be deflationary to traditional oilfield services going forward. Your customers can do more with less. Would you agree with that? And do you think that future digital revenue to Halliburton, presumably it comes at higher margins, it’s more sustainable, can that more than offset this deflation over the next several years?
Jeff Miller: I think it can, because I think what's missing in this deflation discussion is the moat that comes in around our equipment, that allows so much cost savings on the client side part of the business that we’ll be able to reap better margins and better returns on those assets to deliver those solution. And obviously, at the same time, we’ll likely be reducing our own costs as we work through this. So, I think it will be deflationary in some ways but I think the value and the returns on the not just the componentry but how that componentry is part of that ecosphere really winds the moat that may be isn't there, is prevalent today, but I think we will see that widen and that ultimately drives better returns for us, in spite of what might be deflationary in a number of other areas of the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey. Good morning. I guess, I want to come back to the CapEx question and ask it maybe a different way. If we think about that $1.2 billion of CapEx, what's the split between D&E and C&P?
Lance Loeffler: Yes. Chase, this is Lance. I would say that, it’s very similar to the 60-40 split that we talked about between NAM and international is a good proxy.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. So, 60% C&P, is that what you're saying?
Lance Loeffler: No, no, no. 60% D&E.
Chase Mulvehill: Got it. Okay. All right. If you’re 40%, I think that puts you sub 4% of C&P revenues if we think about CapEx as a percentage of revenues. Obviously, lower than kind of what you did in 2016 as a percentage of revenues. If we look over the next couple of years and kind of call it a sluggish, modest growth North America environment, how should we think about C&P CapEx over the next couple years and maybe frame it on a percentage of revenues?
Lance Loeffler: Yes. Look, I think structurally lower, as we described it, based more on the market and the opportunity set that we see. But, we are really careful not to -- we don't peg this to percents of revenues and others things because then when get sort of odd answers when we see markets growing, and I don't think growth is geared that way to our CapEx necessarily. And so, we will continue to focus on the best returning opportunities where we see those. But, the idea that it's going to have to move -- the CapEx is going to move as percentage with revenues is really not -- that's not how we approach that.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. That makes sense. And then, coming back to frac, you talked about 22% less frac horsepower. Is that the amount that you've actually retired? Is that the amount that you've actually taken out of the market from an active fleet reduction? And then, a quick one follow-up to that. You talked about improvement in frac utilization in 2020 for your active fleets. Do you care to kind of quantify that? How much improvement in utilization across your active fleets you think you can get in 2020?
Jeff Miller: Look, I'll start with the first question. The 22% that we described is out of the market sold by the pound retired. But that’s done some good things for us. I mean, the reality is that we're 90% Q10s at this point, our costs are lower, our service quality is the best it's ever been. So, that's how we view that. The activity, I guess, is -- as we look out at the balance of the year or in terms of utilization, part of maximizing profitability of that fleet and the returns on that fleet is keeping it busy. And as I described earlier we started the year 95% committed, which is the best we’ve been in sometimes. So I'm encouraged by that outlook based on the fleet that we have.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Kurt Hallead: I was kind of curious first and foremost on the international front, when we look at 2020. Where do you think the best relative growth prospects are for Halliburton? You mentioned that Asia Pac was a major contributor here in ‘19. So just kind of curious on how you see the regional dynamics play out for 2020?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think it's again led by Asia Pac. In 2020 Europe/CIS continues to be strong as we get into a full year of activity on a number of the contracts we talked about in the past. Africa grows but it will be a bit more-choppy, as it works through exploration and regulatory sort of resetting in that market. Middle East remains robust, but obviously starts at a fairly high point as the market itself, and LatAm likely brings up the rear.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. I appreciate that dynamic. And then, I just want to get a little bit better understanding here on just the guidance you provided for first quarter on the margin progressions for C&P and D&E. And I want to try to get in this context. For C&P, when you look at the margin degradation on a quarter-on-quarter basis, could you give us some general sense of how much is that related to the absence of the tool sales versus market dynamics?
Lance Loeffler: Yes. Kurt, this is Lance. Yes. It’s definitely impacted by just a non-recurring nature of year-end product sales in the C&P division, which were probably up 10% to 15% versus what we saw in 2018. So, we had a good fourth quarter at our C&P division in terms of year-end equipment sales. 
Kurt Hallead: Okay. And then, can the same be said for D&E?
Lance Loeffler: I'm sorry? 
Kurt Hallead: I'll let you continue, Lance. Sorry.
Lance Loeffler: No. And then -- and that is obviously, those margins are accretive. So, what we see replacing that in the first quarter in terms of activity, largely in the resumption of our pressure pumping business in North America is coming at lower margins. And so, you see offset of that.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. Can the same be said for D&E?
Lance Loeffler: Yes, same can be said for D&E, probably more comparative, flattish year-over-year in terms of year-end product sales in our D&E division.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is now open. 
Marc Bianchi: Jeff, you were talking about oversupply still in the frac market, and with your retirements and what we've heard from the others, there has been pretty significant reduction so far. What do you think is needed from here to kind of balance the market and what do you think the timeline is for that?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, I think, what's most important is that that attrition is real. I get this question a lot. And I think a quarter ago, I said -- I thought it was 20%, which was viewed as high, turns out that's right in the fairway. So, that attrition is in fact occurring. And the market forces or the forces that drove that attrition haven't changed at all in terms of amount of sand pumps, number of stages per day. All of those things that drive that attrition haven't changed. And so, I suspect we continue on a pace that’s at least consistent with that. As far as the timeline of when we see it, it happens at some point. It doesn't change the way we go to the market today. And so, we are so focused on delivering our strategy around cost reduction and our service delivery improvement that when that happens it will be terrific and we will see a great boost from that. I think in the meantime, we’ve got a plan to deliver solid free cash flows and return sort of in any market.
Marc Bianchi: Okay. Thanks for that. Maybe someone related, we’ve got the guidance here for first quarter for C&P margins, which includes the full benefit of all the cost cutting you are doing. Where do you think those margins can get absent any kind of pricing recovery for the frac side of business? Is there -- just through the self-help I think you’re talking about a bogey that you would point to, over the next number of quarters?
Jeff Miller: Look, no, I mean, I think we’ve provided guidance on Q1. I view strategy as something that we executed and we continue to see the value and benefit from. And so, we’re taking a very long view of this business and the actions that we’re taking beyond Q1 to continue to contribute and improve the business. And I think that we will continue to outperform, like we have the highest margins today in North America and we will continue to add to that.
Operator: And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the call back to Mr. Miller for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Liz. Before we wrap up, I’d like to close with a few points. First, I expect that Halliburton’s international growth will continue in 2020, and that the combination of capital discipline, pricing improvements and technology will lead to margin expansion. Second, Halliburton will continue executing our North America playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow. And finally, I believe digitalization will define the next decade, and Halliburton is uniquely positioned to reap the benefits. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Liz, please close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release and can also be found in the Quarterly Results & Presentation section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you. Abu, and good morning, everyone. As the second half of 2019 unfolds, US and international markets continue to diverge. International activity growth is gaining momentum across multiple regions. Meanwhile, operators' capital discipline weighs on North American activity levels. That said, our outstanding employees executed effectively in the third quarter. We managed the market dynamics and delivered on our financial results as per expectations.  Let me cover some headlines. Total company revenue was $5.6 billion and operating income was $536 million, representing decreases of 6% and 3% respectively compared to the second quarter of 2019. Our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue was down 4% sequentially, but operating income grew 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our international D&E operating margin increased 180 basis points. Overall, D&E margin performance was negatively impacted by weaker demand for our services in North America. Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 8% sequentially, driven by lower completions activity in North America land. C&P operating margin was essentially flat compared to the second quarter, supported by strong international activity and the execution of our new playbook in North America. International revenue was flat sequentially, but is up 10% year-to-date. Lower project management and stimulation activity in the Middle East and Asia offset healthy growth in Latin America and Europe/Eurasia in the third quarter. North America revenue decreased 11% sequentially, primarily driven by customer activity declines. And finally, we generated approximately $530 million of free cash flow in the third quarter, a significant improvement over the first half of the year. In the third quarter, supply and demand uncertainties continued to impact commodity prices. On the one hand, Iran sanctions, Venezuela production declines, and political instability in Latin America and North Africa are constraining supply. On the other hand, there is near-term uncertainty in demand due to ongoing US-China trade tensions and negative economic data out of Asia and Europe. As the US production growth continues to weigh on supply, OPEC+ extended its agreement until March 2020 to manage production and support oil prices. Even with these crosscurrents, international growth continues at a steady pace. This summer, I spent a month visiting our customers in the Eastern Hemisphere, and I'm excited by what I saw, consistently improving markets across Europe, Asia, and Australia. This confirms my confidence in Halliburton delivering high-single digit international revenue growth this year. It is important to note that both of our divisions are meaningfully contributing to our international growth. Our Drilling and Evaluation division traditionally had the most exposure to international markets, with about 70% of division revenues coming from outside North America. The revenue split has generally been the opposite for our Completion and Production division. We're pleased to see the C&P division increasing its participation in the international markets in this cycle. Year-to-date, international C&P revenue has grown 13%, double the international revenue growth rate of D&E. In today's environment, customers aim to squeeze every available barrel from their existing assets. So, mature fields development is prominent. We also see increased unconventional activity in several international regions. The technology mix required for development-focused, production-oriented, and unconventional project plays to our C&P portfolio strengths. With a focus on the international mature fields market, we're growing our production group, part of the C&P division that comprises artificial lift, specialty chemicals, and well intervention solutions. Historically, Halliburton primarily participated in the drilling and completion stages of a well's lifecycle. With our expansion into production services, we're tapping into a long-term, later cycle market with significant growth potential. Our well intervention business helps operators diagnose field productivity issues and design and deliver immediate impact solutions leveraging our custom chemistries and tools.  This capability is critical for mature fields. With rig-less intervention and well surveillance activity increasing, especially in the Middle East, Europe and Asia, we've already executed multiple contract startups in 13 different countries this year. In Latin America, we've recently deployed our SPECTRUM FUSION hybrid coil tubing service for a customer in Colombia. In a single trip, with the well still producing, we provided real-time visualization of the shape and location of old perforations and performed production logging, while maintaining the ability to circulate fluid to clean the well as needed. The customer gathered valuable downhole insights without having to take the well off-production. In the last couple of years, we've had a significant uptick in unconventional activity in several Middle Eastern countries as well as in Argentina and Australia. Our production enhancement business demonstrated strong international growth year-to-date, benefiting from these developments. Halliburton leveraged our experience in US shales to provide a customized application of technology, logistics management, and operational excellence to maximize asset value for our international customers. In Argentina, Halliburton delivered the highest number of frac stages to date in the third quarter as a result of consistent execution and applying service efficiency best practices in the Vaca Muerta shale play. Our completion tools and cementing businesses also increased international revenue and margins on the back of strong activity recovery in the UK and Norway sectors of the North Sea, IOC activity expansion in Brazil and Mexico, and increased demand from Asia and the Middle East. We grew cementing services as well as installations of casing equipment and intelligent multi-lateral and core completion solutions for customers in all these markets.  For example, this summer, we installed a multi-lateral completion to increase reservoir exposure and inflow control in an operator's mature field in Norway. This intelligent completion system allowed the operator to manage production from each of the four laterals without impacting production from the others in the event of a gas influx or water breakthrough. To be clear, our Drilling and Evaluation businesses are also meaningfully contributing to our international growth. As you know, Halliburton entered this international recovery a much stronger competitor due in large part to technology investments we've made in key services like drilling, LWD, open hole wireline, and testing. Recently, an operator recognized Halliburton wireline as a benchmark for service quality and execution in an ultra-deepwater exploration campaign in West Africa. Open hole wireline data collected at water depth over 10,000 feet helped the customer to confirm significant additional reserves and successfully determine fracture enclosure pressure in sand and shale formations. In the Norwegian North Sea, an operator has adopted our latest logging-while-drilling innovation, the EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity service as a standard in their exploration wells. The customer's target formation has exceedingly complex geometry, making it hard to interpret using conventional methods. The unique 3D inversion capability of the EarthStar sensor is the only LWD technology capable of reliably mapping such complex structures. Looking to 2020, I see more international topline and margin growth opportunities for Halliburton coming from mature fields and shallow water markets. Barring a global economic slowdown, a broader offshore recovery should add momentum to the international growth going forward. Offshore rig count increased 19% year-on-year and sanctioned FID volumes are up 20% compared to last year, led by Guyana, Brazil and Azerbaijan project sanctions. Recently, Woodside Energy awarded Halliburton drilling and completion services for its deepwater field development campaign in offshore Senegal. It's due for the final investment decision in December and work is planned to start in late 2020 or early 2021.  The campaign is expected to include 18 wells with up to 8 optional wells over an estimated 3 to 4 year term. Halliburton was awarded the well construction, lower completions, e-line, slick line cold tubing and well testing services. We have also announced several new offshore project wins this year in Latin America and the Middle East. Our pipeline of projects is strong and I expect Halliburton to outperform the growth in international drilling and completion spending next year. Increasing activity and improving pricing across markets, our ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services and reallocating assets to the markets where we can earn the highest returns, I believe, will improve our international margins going forward. In North America, the market is very different. Customer spending has decreased and is largely concentrated in the first half of the year. The US land rig count declined 11% from the second to the third quarter for the first time in 10 years. And while, historically, the third quarter used to be the busiest in terms of hydraulic fracturing activity in the US, stage counts declined every month this quarter. As a result, the market for both drilling and completion services in North America softened during the third quarter, impacting service company activity, and Halliburton was no exception. Throughout the third quarter, pricing pressures continued as operators tried to lower overall costs in order to meet their cash flow objectives. We are the execution company. So, let's talk about how we are proactively executing our North America playbook with a clear purpose to generate returns and free cash flow.  This is what it looks like. We are stacking equipment. In the third quarter, we stacked more equipment than we did in the first six months of the year. While this impacts our revenues, we would rather err on the side of stacking than work for insufficient margins and wear out our equipment. We're reducing costs. You've seen us do this before. We took out $1 billion in 2016. We reorganized and reduced our fixed costs in North America earlier this year. We continue to evaluate the way we work and we'll keep reducing costs in our North American operations. We're aligning with the right customers. We are and continue to be aligned with the customer groups that are spending and that value our services. We're deploying technology that lowers our cost and accrues value to Halliburton. Take integrated well completions, for example. It is a combination of wireline and fracturing services. It is one thing to have both product lines and another thing to integrate them technically and culturally and achieve lower cost on location. It takes R&D effort to develop a host of new proprietary technologies that enable this integration. Halliburton's integrated well completions offering minimizes non-productive time, improves efficiency, reduces personnel on location and capital costs for Halliburton. This technology integration, which is hard to duplicate, improves customer efficiency, but, more importantly, it improves our margins. These actions allows us to maximize our active fleet utilization and protect our margins. Our third quarter results demonstrate that our new North America playbook is working and is the right approach for this market. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we see more of the same. We expect customer activity to decline across all basins in North America land, impacting both our drilling and completion businesses. Feedback from our customers leads us to believe that the rig count and completions activity may be lower than in the fourth quarter of last year. While holidays and potential weather impacts are the usual culprits, other drivers of this continued activity decline are our customers' free cash flow generation commitments, an oversupplied gas market and concerns about oil demand softness in 2020. Given the reduction and cadence in customer spending that we see, we plan to further change the way we deliver our services in order to improve our margins and maximize returns. In the fourth quarter, consistent with our playbook, we plan to undertake further cost reductions by streamlining our operations and corporate functions. We're still finalizing our estimates, but expect to capture approximately $300 million in annualized cost savings over the next few quarters. Importantly, regardless of the cuts and idling of equipment, the size and scale of our business in North America give us the ability to drive a sustainable model without sacrificing our leadership position. I believe that the actions we are taking will enable Halliburton to evolve and emerge stronger in the future. So, what changes the narrative for North America going forward? While the cadence of activity will likely remain the same over the near term, there are a few other key trends we're watching closely today that should play out over time and alter the market dynamics in US land. First, attrition. Given demand deceleration, the service industry has adjusted accordingly and cut capital spend this year. There were hardly any new equipment additions and maintenance spending has been severely curtailed. All the while, service intensity showed no signs of slowing down. Multiwell pad penetration continued, lateral length kept growing and proppant loading increased further.  The direct result of higher service intensity, especially in terms of hours pumped per day, is the increase in maintenance frequency. This should accelerate the long-awaited equipment attrition from the market, both voluntary through stacking and involuntary. As I said at the beginning of the year, there would be less horsepower available in the market at the end of the year than there was in January. We can now see this happening as service companies are cannibalizing stacked equipment for parts rather than paying for replacement components due to budget constraints. We expect attrition to continue into 2020. At Halliburton, our size and scale allow us to flex down with the market and generate sufficient free cash flow to keep our active fleet healthy. We benefit from in-house manufacturing, digital preventative maintenance protocols, ongoing materials R&D and automation efforts to increase equipment lifespan. These are unique competitive advantages that are hard and expensive to replicate in this market. Second, some of our customers are changing their buying behavior. They have started contracting for services and integrated packages rather than discreetly. This helps tie up multiple services, compresses the learning curve and drives cost savings and efficiencies for both us and our customers. This is similar to how the North Sea has volved over the last few years. We're currently working on integrated projects with customers in the Bakken and the Permian. The collaboration has resulted in better performance and helped secure longer-term customer commitment. Some companies are increasingly centralizing the management of their procurement activities. This should lead to supplier rationalization and concentration of a larger share of the work with a select number of high quality, safe and efficient service companies. We believe that these new customer-buying behaviors uniquely position Halliburton to get an outsized share of their spend. Finally, one more trend we are watching is the deceleration of incremental US production growth brought about by capital discipline. The record-breaking 2018 growth will not be replicated in 2019. In fact, current projections for 2020 indicate a further decline in production from the current-year estimates. To maximize production per every CapEx dollar they spend, operators will require technologies that can improve both efficiencies and well productivity. Instead of counting stages, they will want to make every stage count. For this, I believe, they will turn to Halliburton. We bring to the table technologies like automated fracturing and distributed fiber optic sensing that are tailor-made for addressing production challenges. While customers are mostly focused on price today, early studies confirm our technologies work. They are hard to replicate and will be more valuable to Halliburton over time. Also, with declining US incremental contribution to world production, non-US production will be required to fill the gap. This means more growth in international and offshore markets and more opportunities for Halliburton. As the international recovery continues and the North American market matures, our strategy will allow us to thrive in this dynamic environment. I believe that the actions I have described to you today will ensure that Halliburton continues to improve its earnings power and generate strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns in the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lance for a financial update. Lance?
Lance Loeffler: Thank you, Jeff. And good morning. Let's begin with an overview of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2019.  Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.6 billion and operating income was $536 million, representing decreases of 6% and 3% respectively. North America led the decline as a result of activity and pricing headwinds.  Let me go over the details of our divisional results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3.5 billion, a decrease of $299 million or 8%, while operating income was $446 million, a decrease of $24 million or 5%. These results were primarily driven by lower pressure pumping activity and pricing in North America land, coupled with decreased completion tool sales in Latin America and reduced simulation activity in the Middle East/Asia. Partially offsetting these declines were increased cementing activity in the eastern hemisphere, improved completion tool sales in Europe/Africa/CIS, and higher simulation activity in Latin America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2 billion, a decrease of $81 million or 4%, while operating income was $150 million, an increase of $5 million or 3%. These results were driven by reduced drilling and wireline activity in North America and lower project management activity in Middle East/Asia. These declines were partially offset by higher drilling activity in the eastern hemisphere, fluids activity in Latin America and higher testing and software sales globally, resulting in better overall margins. Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue in the third quarter of 2019 was $2.9 billion, an 11% decrease, primarily associated with lower activity and pricing in pressure pumping and well construction services in North America land. In Latin America, revenue was $608 million, a 6% increase, resulting primarily from higher activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina, increased testing activity and artificial lift sales across the region, and improved fluids activity in Mexico. These improvements were partially offset by lower completion tool sales in Brazil.  Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue was $831 million, which was essentially flat with the second quarter. Higher activity across multiple product service lines in Russia, the Caspian and North Sea offset lower activity in West Africa. In the Middle East/Asia, revenue was $1.2 billion, a 4% decrease, largely resulting from reduced project management and simulation activity across the region. These declines were partially offset by increased activity in multiple product service lines in Indonesia. In the third quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $60 million. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the fourth quarter will revert to our average run rate of approximately $65 million. Our net interest expense for the quarter was $141 million and we expect it to remain approximately the same in the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 20%, coming in slightly lower than anticipated due to certain discrete tax benefits. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be 23% based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix. Our full-year effective tax rate should be approximately 22%. We generated $871 million of cash from operations in the third quarter. Our free cash flow generation for the quarter was approximately $530 million and we reached positive free cash flow on a year-to-date basis.  We believe further improvement in receivables and a drawdown and inventory in the fourth quarter will allow us to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $345 million and our 2019 full-year CapEx guidance remains unchanged. We told you last quarter that our capital spend in 2020 would be significantly less than $1.6 billion.  We are carefully monitoring the market dynamics in North America and will exercise prudent judgment to make further adjustments according to the anticipated activity levels in 2020. Finally, let me provide you with some comments on our operations outlook for the fourth quarter. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect sequential revenue to be flat to up low single-digits, with margin improvement in the range of 425 basis points to 475 basis points. This is driven by year-end software and product sales combined with activity increases across our international markets, offset by lower demand in North America land. In our Completion and Production division, we believe our sequential revenue will be down low-double digits, with margins expected to decline 125 basis points to 175 basis points. As Jeff stated, in North America, we have continued to stack equipment that does not meet our returns threshold and we will be proactive in reducing costs. We anticipate that higher activity in Asia and the Middle East will be offset by activity declines in North America land, Latin America, and Europe and Eurasia. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for closing comments. Jeff?
Jeffrey Miller : Thanks, Lance. In summary, international growth continues at a steady pace across multiple regions, benefiting both our D&E and C&P divisions. Increased activity, pricing improvements, our ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services and reallocation of our assets should lead to higher international margins as we look past this year. In North America, we expect activity reductions to continue into the fourth quarter. Halliburton is successfully executing our new North America playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow. We stacked additional equipment throughout the quarter and will continue managing utilization with a focus on returns. We're aligning with the right customers. We're introducing new technologies to improve margins. And we will continue to take actions that lower the overall service delivery cost. I want to close by thanking our employees for their outstanding focus and dedication to our company and our customers. Your resiliency and hard work are the foundation of our company's strength and why together we can continue delivering on our promise to our shareholders. And now, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
James West: Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Lance. 
Jeffrey Miller: Good morning, James.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, James.
James West: So, Jeff, obviously, [technical difficulty] third quarter. Fourth quarter, as Lance described is just going to be fairly tough. What does this mean for the exit rate and how are we going to 2020 and how the outlook there starts to shape up?
Jeffrey Miller: Yeah. Thanks, James. You're a little crackly there at the beginning, but as we look at the Q4 activity, obviously, we think budget exhaustion, et cetera, starts to bring that down. I expect we'll see an uptick as we go into Q1 of 2020, and I think that's a little bit getting to that cadence of spend. So, I think that we'll be increasing activity certainly in the first half – first quarter and then really first half of 2020, and our playbook will have us ready to take advantage of that.
James West: Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then, as we talk about the playbook or think about the playbook, what are you seeing from your competition? Clearly, some of these guys can't actually perform at the same levels or will not perform at the same levels, but also some may follow you on your returns-focused strategy. What have you seen so far from you showing leadership here with your willingness to walk away from the underperforming contracts or low return [ph] contracts versus your peers?
Jeffrey Miller: James, we're early in that process now. And, I guess, my view is we know we are extremely competitive. We have very good margins and returns in that business relative to anyone in that marketplace. And so, when we see an opportunity where it transacts well below cost, we're pretty comfortable stepping back from that just because we don't want to burn up our equipment without making the kind of returns and cash flow that we want to make. So, to be seen, I fully expect we'll see the – we see it actually some today, the flight to quality. Our service delivery is very, very good; our safety performance is very, very good. And so, I think this unfolds as equipment just gets tighter. And I think we're well-positioned in this market.
James West: Got it. Thanks, guys. 
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you.
Lance Loeffler: Thanks, James.
Operator: Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Angeline Sedita: Good morning, guys. 
Jeffrey Miller: Good morning, Angie.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, Angie. 
Angeline Sedita: Good morning. So, Jeff, maybe a little bit more color on the international markets and the visibility there, I think there's some debate about the pace of growth for 2020. So, I'd love to hear what you're seeing out there and the prospects for having similar growth rates in 2020 as you did in 2019, and maybe you could also touch on the growth you saw in C&P versus D&E?
Jeffrey Miller: Yeah. Thanks, Angie. Less clear on – we just don't have the visibility on 2020 at this point because it's still early. That said, I believe Halliburton outgrows the increase in drilling and completion spend, whatever that is internationally. And as I described, I think we've got a good set of contracts set up for 2020. And, technically, we're very well-positioned for 2020. And so, without trying to put a number on that today, I feel Halliburton will be very competitive in that space, anyway. Yeah.
Angeline Sedita: Okay. Okay. So, maybe on your remarks on the attrition, it'd be great to hear any additional color on attrition and retirements for Halliburton and what you're hearing for the industry as a whole for even this year and next year, and how much supply you think could be pulled out of the market?
Jeffrey Miller: Yeah. As I've always said, it's hard to see attrition until there's a call on the equipment, but it's pretty clear there's less equipment in the market today than there was at the beginning of the year, and that amount varies in terms of how people call it. We think it's 15% to 20% easily in the marketplace. But then, we watch equipment adds, of which there really aren't any, and we know how hard equipment is working. And so, I really believe we will continue to see that as we go into even 2020 in terms of the attrition happening. And our view of the market is we want to be super careful with our equipment. We want to work it for returns and when we don't see those returns, we want to set it to the side.
Angeline Sedita: Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over.
Jeffrey Miller: Thanks, Angie.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Sean Meakim: Thank you. Good morning.
Jeffrey Miller: Good morning, Sean.
Sean Meakim: So, on free cash flow, I was hoping we could get a little bit more granular on the quarter and the guide. So, collections improved, I think, as we expected, but payables also fell a good amount. Inventory is still growing. CapEx is unchanged for the year. Sounds like earnings power is going to be challenged in the fourth quarter. So the $900 million of free cash that you're effectively guiding for this quarter is dependent upon working capital to a large degree. Could you maybe just walk us through those pieces?
Lance Loeffler: Yeah, Sean. Let me take a stab at that. So, look, we did make considerable improvements in 3Q. I think that that momentum clearly has to continue into 4Q, and it's really done – as you talk about the working capital movements, we continue to believe that we're going to progress on the way that we're collecting our receivables expect inventory will draw down as we deliver on our completion tools orders for the fourth quarter. And my belief is that working capital on a year-on-year basis is still relatively flat in 2019. 
Sean Meakim: Okay.
Lance Loeffler: I'd also say, in addition to the working capital goals that we have in the fourth quarter, we're also going to be down on CapEx as well. The rate of spend of CapEx that will contribute to that free cash flow number.
Sean Meakim: Got it. Thank you for that.
Jeffrey Miller: And then, maybe just on the D&E margin ramp, some moving pieces there too. In the third quarter, top line fell, but margins expanded. So, you had got North America. It's challenging on the top line, but you're getting some progress where you're trying to go on the international side. For the fourth quarter, it seems like similar dynamics, but a little bit different. The international is helping you more given the year-end product sales, et cetera. Are we getting those moving parts correctly and then, can we just get a little bit more of an update on how iCruise is fitting into that relatively? What your expectations would have been, say, 9, 12 months ago?
Jeffrey Miller: Yeah. thanks, Sean. I'll start with the second part of that question. The iCruise is really delivering what we had expected though it is obviously – some of the contracts we were targeting or have been won, but are moving a bit to the right. That said, the performance of the tool, very good, very excited about what it can do, and coupled with EarthStar, for example, really is delivering on the technical promise that we had hoped. So, I expect, as I look through Q4 and into 2020 and beyond that the value of this suite of technology is going to be very impactful. In fact, I'll just comment here, at the World Oil Awards this week, actually the best drilling technology was the EarthStar 3D Inversion which is fantastic technology. So, to get back to progression, we kind of see a longer ramp on the recovery of that business, but all of the building blocks are in place and the technical approach is working, and I see us winning the kind of contracts that I think are required to earn higher margins.
Sean Meakim: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning. 
Jeffrey Miller: Good morning.
Scott Gruber: Good morning. Staying on D&E margins, I know you guys typically forecast just one quarter ahead, but I was curious about a bit of color on 1Q. How should we think about margins going into next year? You have a bit more North Sea exposure at this point. Has that changed the seasonality? Are we going to see a little more seasonal impact on D&E margins or is there still sufficient underlying profit improvement that you can offset and have more normal seasonal margin performance in 1Q?
Lance Loeffler: Scott, this is Lance. Appreciate the question. I think looking ahead, I think there's still going to be some seasonality in 1Q. We're still dealing with weather in the Northern Hemisphere as we traditionally see it. But I think, overall, as you think about where international margins can go, based on some of the comments Jeff made prior, I think not only are you seeing the investment in technology come to fruition and what we expect, but also just generally more activity in the international markets help improve – also seeing better pricing in certain regions around the world. That comes because of the tightness of tools, et cetera, that will drive that. So, I think that there is, obviously, continued progression on where we see international margins going, not just in the fourth quarter, but into next year.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And then, on the $300 million of cost savings, obviously, you'll get a bit in 4Q. Can you just provide a bit more color on how that phases in over the next few quarters and whether there's any offset in terms of severance or facility closure cost and how large those could be?
Lance Loeffler: Yeah. Scott, I'm not going get into the details today on that. I think the point is is that we're focused on lowering our service delivery costs. And I think probably the most important point is is that we're being decisive, right? We're looking to move quickly around cost reductions in North America. We've seen some of those actions – seen some of the benefit of those actions that we took in 2Q. I'd just say stay tuned over the course of the next couple of quarters.
Jeffrey Miller: I think just to add to that, when we think about our North America playbook which is driving specifically towards utilization and efficiency and cost, I think this playbook is right squarely in the middle of the types of decisive actions we're taking around taking out costs. 
Scott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you.
Jeffrey Miller: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey. Good morning, fellas. I guess I just want to follow-up on Scott's question here. So, maybe on 4Q for D&E, I don't know if you can maybe help us kind of understand how much of the improvement in margin on the revenue side is attributed to kind of the software sales that you typically get in the fourth quarter? And then, along those lines, how much of the $300 million of cost savings are included in your 4Q guide?
Lance Loeffler: Yeah. Appreciate the question, Chase. Look, I think in terms of the impact on software and product sales for the fourth quarter, it's relatively the same as we saw last year. So, not above or below what we experienced last year.  On the cost-cutting side, look, again, I'm not going to get into the details today on the call on how that transforms over the next couple of quarters, but we will keep you posted as that continues to develop.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, all right. Follow-up. Listening to the prepared remarks, Jeff, you talked about your more integrated packages that you're seeing in US onshore. Maybe could you expand a little bit, what kind of customers you're seeing kind of push more towards integrated packages? And is this more on the drilling side, the completion side or both?
Jeffrey Miller: I'd really say it's both. And it's customers of all sizes quite frankly, but probably more to the – larger into that. And I think some of that's just reflect – look, this is the early days, but it's encouraging because I know the type of safety and service quality performance that we have in the market and the ability to put more things together, I think, drives better performance over time. It's really a collective investment and a learning curve that drives that kind of efficiency. And we've seen that actually evolve in the North Sea. So, while early days North America, very early days, I think there's an analog which was the North Sea, which was obviously a very disintermediated market probably just five or six years ago and we've seen roughly 90% of our work today in the North Sea is in some form or fashion of integrated or bundled or in some form or fashion a more stable set of work that is more outcome-based that then allows us to, over time, demonstrate really some of the things that make Halliburton so reliable and so efficient over the long term. 
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, all right. That's helpful. Thanks, Jeff. I'll turn it back over.
Jeffrey Miller: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Your line is open. 
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning.
Jeffrey Miller: Good morning. 
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, Kurt. 
Kurt Hallead: Appreciate all that color so far. Good stuff. The question I had for you initially here is on the US/North American frac, Completion and Production side of the business, right? You guys talked about a cost reduction effort that's underway, focus on the right players, et cetera. However, it looks like the market is still going to be kind of devoid of pricing, right? So, when we think about the – or when you guys think about your business in US, and US frac, in particular, beyond your cost reductions and pricing, do you think there is other ways you can drive margin improvement, Jeff?
Jeffrey Miller: Yes, I do. I think, strategically – technology is always an important part of this business and we continue to invest in technology. And some of that technology allows us to lower our cost. And we don't necessarily spend a lot of time talking about that simply because it's not for sale. I want to keep it and have that benefit accrue to Halliburton. I talked about one just this quarter on the call with integrated completions, but that's more complicated to do than meets the eye and it actually drives a lot of cost savings for Halliburton. When we direct our efforts that way, that is part of the sustainable competitive advantage we have around not just cost cutting – actually, I don't see it as cost cutting. I see the playbook actually is strategically driving better efficiency and better margins sort of in the face of where the market is today.  And I say all of that – and I want to pivot to what I really think the future looks like, which, over the next few years, the dialogue I believe will be more around recovery factors in unconventionals and less about just pure speed. And I think, in that market, some of the things we're doing with Prodigi and a host of things that I think will be quite impactful in that future scenario, which the future – what, a couple years out, but I'm really excited about that also. And nothing we're doing today gets in the way of delivering on that future set of technologies.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. That's great color. Then you indicated – you gave us some sense on attrition. Say, on a general basis, it runs maybe 15% to 20% per year. And then, given the dynamics at play in the marketplace with companies not generating enough free cash to put into the maintenance, what would be your assessment above and beyond that 15% to 20%? I know you didn't really – maybe not want to comment on it, but maybe pressing a little bit here, kind of give us your best guess as to what you think it could be given the underinvestment in the business?
Jeffrey Miller: Look, I think this is something that accelerates, particularly as we get into 2020. We'll see an uptick in the first half of the year, first quarter, and I think there will be stress in the system at that point. The extent to which there isn't new investment in this business, that just continues to wear on equipment. So, it has to accelerate over time.
Kurt Hallead: All right. Jeff, I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. 
Dan Boyd: Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.
Jeffrey Miller: Good morning, Dan.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, Dan.
Dan Boyd: So, thinking about the 300 million in cost savings over the next three quarters, can you give us an idea on how much that is fixed versus variable?
Jeffrey Miller: I think most of that would be more in the fixed category, not the variable. The variable costs, we're managing all of the time. And, in fact, our ability to flex up and down on variable cost allows us to be, I think, hyper responsive to moves in the marketplace. But when we attack – the type of fixed cost things are the parts that – that's the removal of the waste that is permanent when we think about continuous improvement and driving there. And that's what you saw in the second quarter as well. It was a move around taking out waste. And so, that tends to come in steps as we sort of evaluate how best to get that efficiency and then we're able to move on the cost.
Dan Boyd: Okay, great. And then, Lance, just going back to the D&E margins, I think what we're all trying to figure out is just what the go-forward run rate is, exit any kind of 4Q seasonality. So, earlier this year, we talked about flat margins year-on-year. Looks like they're maybe going to come in a little bit below, closer to 8%. But should we be thinking about the new run rate being in the double-digit range on an annual basis or is it just too early to say?
Lance Loeffler: I think to try to call 2020, it's probably a little early, but we firmly believe that margins in D&E and the international markets are higher than where they are today. Obviously, we've got room to run. I think as the markets continue to improve and for the things that I sort of talked about maybe on an earlier question around activity, leads to tool tightness, more constructive pricing discussions and further implementation of our technology, particularly on the drilling side, we're encouraged by what we see. So, yes, the goal is to be higher than where we are today, clearly, but little too early to call on what would be our expectations for a 2020 market.
Jeffrey Miller: Maybe just to add to that if I could. The other important part of this is, as we manage capital, we are reallocating assets where we believe we need to in order to drive those margins up. So, we see tool tightness in the marketplace broadly. And, clearly, we're going to move those assets to where they make the best returns. And so, I think that, in and of itself, drives better margins over time. And at the same time, we do have the ability to meet and exceed growth rates, I believe, internationally.
Dan Boyd: Maybe just kind of sneak one more in on that. When you look at the margin improvement then in D&E, Lance, how much of it would you just – if you had to put it in two buckets of – one self-help and then the other one just being external market growth and pricing. How should we think about that?
Lance Loeffler: I would weight that to the latter…
Dan Boyd: Okay.
Lance Loeffler: …in terms of activity and pricing.
Dan Boyd: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Jeffrey Miller: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.
David Anderson: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. So, aside from the pressure pumping aspect, I was wondering about what other parts of your North American business have been impacted by the new playbook? I know part of this is you're looking at every business in terms of its returns. I was just kind of curious, how many of those product lines are kind of underwater in terms of returns? I just wonder if you can just kind of help us understand how this new playbook is impacting the other parts of your business.
Jeffrey Miller: I think it has an impact on all parts of our business. I think our view to, obviously, improving returns will get to other parts of the business. And I think that anything we do, in some cases, to take out fixed costs also have an impact on other parts of the business. So, can't do one really without the other. We like all of our businesses in North America. And I think they all benefit a degree from the approach we're taking with frac. So, it's probably more pronounced with frac.
David Anderson: Okay. I was just curious, there's been a lot of talk about the digital space over the past quarter. You announced 10 new applications on your DecisionSpace 365 digital platform. But as we kind of look out there and we see a lot of promise out there. I was just curious how you're thinking about the investment required. A bit of an arms race going on it seems like out there. But can you give us a sense as to how much your R&D spending is today dedicated towards digital and how are you thinking about spending kind of going forward over the next few years in that space?
Jeffrey Miller: Yeah. I think the capital and R&D spend around that is included in sort of our run rate. So, I don't think it's going to be outsized to what you've seen us do in the past. I think the – we really like our landmark business. We are a leading software provider in the industry. We hosted an important event in Houston. We had 1,300 customers at our event in Houston to look at sort of the future of digital and had thought leaders who are also our clients present at that event. But I think the key focus and where we will spend more time talking to you, it will be around how it's monetized because I think that's really the important component of all things digital, which is – in my view, it's internal efficiency, enhanced tools that we charge more for and then software sales and consulting that we sell directly to clients. And you hear me talk about those at different times. I'll try to frame them better, but if I think our enhanced tools, 3D inversion is a good example of that with EarthStar, that has a lot of digital involved in making it work. Internal efficiencies look like things like our maintenance, it's automated, and digital planning and manufacturing. And then, 365 being one of the products that we actually sell, both in the cloud and the subscription model. So, I'm comfortable with where we are. In fact, I really like where we are digitally and I think the digital principles that we laid out early around being open architecture, evolving with partners, and then clearly making returns for Halliburton are the right – that is absolutely the right strategy.
David Anderson: Great. Thanks, Jeff. 
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Your line is open.
Marc Bianchi: Thank you. I wanted to ask – first on CapEx, I suspect you guys aren't looking to get into what you expect to spend in 2020. But just looking where the run rate is here in third quarter and then saying it's going to be again lower in fourth, is that the right way to think about the CapEx that you think the business needs on a go-forward basis?
Jeffrey Miller: Yeah. I think the timing of the spend is more weighted, obviously, towards the first part of the year just because that's when tools are actually going to work and a lot of the planning goes on as we look to next year. We have a view of where we want things to be and when we want them to be there.
Marc Bianchi: Okay. Thanks for that, Jeff. And back on the $300 million of cost save, is that the right amount of cost save for this level of revenue or how are you thinking about what level of revenue the business will be sized for once you complete that program?
Jeffrey Miller: Look, I think that we continuously take waste out of the business and look for ways to operate it at a lower cost point. So, that's kind of the step that we see right now that is effective. But at the same time, we're always looking for ways to make the business more and more efficient and we'll continue to do that almost irrespective of what we think the revenues are or will be.
Marc Bianchi: Okay. Thanks for that. I'll turn it back. 
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks. 
Jeffrey Miller: Yeah. Thank you, Shannon. Look in closing, I'm excited about the international outlook and how Halliburton is positioned to benefit from these improving conditions. The combination of increased activity, pricing improvements, ability to compete for a larger share of high-margin services and reallocation of our assets should lead to higher international margins as I look towards the future.  Our North America playbook is working. We're driving lower costs, better asset utilization and market-leading returns in the near term, while concurrently developing technology that lowers our cost or is essential to our customers over the longer-term, principally unconventional resource recovery, drilling and digital and all technologies where Halliburton is uniquely positioned to win. So, thank you. I look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Shannon, you can close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Halliburton's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Abu Zeya, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Abu Zeya: Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2019 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2018; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31st, 2019; recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments and other charges. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release and can be found in the Quarterly Results section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Abu. Good morning everyone. Commodity markets navigated some choppy waters during the second quarter. On the one hand, there are global oil demand concerns largely attributed to the uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the U.S.-China trade talks. On the other hand, oil prices have recently been buoyed by supply side reaction to the extension of OPEC plus production cuts, ongoing output declines in Venezuela, U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports, and political instability in Libya and Sudan. Against this backdrop, Halliburton's execution in the second quarter was outstanding and I am very pleased with our results. We continue to build on the growth momentum internationally and successfully managed the market dynamics in North America. Before we dive into the details, here are a few highlights for the second quarter. Total company revenue was $5.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $550 million, representing increases of 3% and 29% respectively compared to the first quarter of 2019. Our Completion and Production division grew revenue 4% and operating income 28% sequentially. Improved completion activity in North America land and our solid execution globally resulted in delivering better-than-expected margins. Our Drilling and Evaluation division grew operating income 18% quarter-over-quarter with strong improvements coming from our Sperry Drilling and Wireline and Perforating product service lines. Overall, D&E division incremental margin was 44%. North America demonstrated solid performance this quarter, delivering 2% revenue growth despite the dropping rig count. International revenue grew 6% sequentially, led by activity increases in the Eastern Hemisphere. And finally, we generated approximately $450 million in operating cash flow as well as positive free cash flow in the second quarter. Now, I'd like to provide some regional commentary beginning with the international markets. I'm excited by what I see internationally, a continued broad-based recovery across multiple geographies, primarily driven by land and shallow water operations. Our business in the North Sea is extremely busy both in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors. We have significantly increased our market share there by winning large tenders. Currently, we're sold out of drilling and wireline tools in the North Sea. As activity keeps ramping up, especially with independent operators taking over IOC assets in the U.K., supply and demand balances significantly tightened for tools and I expect that incremental work will come with better pricing. We see similar dynamics in the Asia-Pacific markets. Malaysia, Australia, and India are all showing strong activity growth. Increased activity leads to better pricing dynamics and we're already seeing the leading edge of pricing improvement in those markets. For instance, tightness in the supply of open hole wireline tools has allowed us to raise prices in certain markets. As to the broader offshore market, we've seen enough signs to anticipate future growth. In June, the year-over-year change in offshore rig count was up for the 12th consecutive month and appears to be gaining momentum. However, the majority of large offshore projects being sanctioned or awarded today have a 2020 or 2021 start date. For example this month we announced an integrated offshore drilling services contract win with Kuwait Oil Company. This is the first offshore project in Kuwait since the 1980s and it includes six high-pressure, high-temperature exploration wells on two jack-up rigs in the Arabian Gulf. Starting next summer, Halliburton will provide well construction services, well testing, coring, coil tubing, and the majority of offshore logistical services under this three-year contract. Halliburton entered this international recovery a much stronger competitor. Over the last decade, we've taken strategic actions that have increased the market opportunities in which we can compete. To be specific, first, we made substantial investments to grow our international footprint in the years prior to the downturn. We increased our product service line presence in various geographies expanded our manufacturing capacity in Singapore, and opened technology centers in Saudi Arabia, India, and Brazil. I cannot emphasize enough how important physical footprint is in the international markets. You simply must be present to win. Second, we made strategic investments and closed technology gaps in product lines that we believe are critical to our success in the international markets. These product lines are Sperry Drilling. I've talked to you a lot about iCruise our new rotary steerable platform. Rotary steerables are used globally for drilling both onshore and offshore wells. A competitive drilling technology is critical because it's not only a higher-margin business, it's also the cornerstone of integrated well construction services. Because of superior technical specs and the modular design of this tool, we're confident that replacing our legacy platform with iCruise will enhance our competitiveness, save on maintenance costs, and improve asset velocity. We're already running it in the U.S. as well as in Latin America, the North Sea, and the Middle East. In fact, it delivered the longest lateral and longest well in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale in its first deployment. Another Sperry innovation introduced last year is the EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity sensor that turns on the high beams in the reservoir, so we can now see over 200 feet around the wellbore while drilling, more than double the depth of detection of other industry offerings.  This technology is critically important for offshore exploration and has been instrumental to Halliburton securing deepwater drilling contracts in Norway, Brazil, and Guyana. During the second quarter, a customer in Norway deployed EarthStar on a deepwater exploration well with a very tight drilling window, one of the most complex wells this operator ever planned. Using the data acquired by the tool, we were able to precisely land the well and to identify secondary pay zones directly impacting the well's production potential. Other product lines we've strengthened are openhole wireline and production testing. These are highly technical and differentiated businesses. Today, Halliburton successfully competes for the most advanced openhole wireline and testing projects around the globe, going head-to-head with our key competitors. All of these efforts give us a strong base to capitalize on the international recovery, and we expect to deliver high-single-digit international revenue growth this year. As I highlighted, our Drilling and Evaluation division, driven in large part by our international footprint, performed as expected in the second quarter. The catalysts for the second half D&E margin improvement are all intact, and I have confidence in our team's ability to execute. We expect to see meaningful revenue ramps in Norway and India as mobilization costs wane and execution starts in earnest. I've talked about the iCruise drilling system and the cost savings it provides to Halliburton. This and other D&E technologies that we're deploying will continue their market penetration and further improve our margin performance. Finally, end-of-year product and software sales should provide additional boost to D&E margins. As I look ahead, I'm encouraged by the leading edge pricing discussions in various international markets. Although, we cut overall CapEx we have not done so at the expense of growing our international business. Our CapEx reduction is driving the right capital allocation decisions and the right pricing and return discussions. Once the activity momentum builds internationally, it's hard to slow it down. Given the timing of contract starts and the current awards pipeline, I expect the activity growth to continue into 2020. Now turning to North America. I am pleased with how Halliburton performed in North America during the quarter. Congratulations to our North America team for a solid execution. In the second quarter we saw a modest improvement in hydraulic fracturing activity which manifested in mid single-digit increases in both completed stages and pumping hours during the quarter. While our pricing remained stable, we were able to improve margins by reducing costs and maximizing our equipment utilization. This is what I mean when I tell you that we will control what we can control and manage our business to perform well in any market conditions. It's important to note that second quarter results were not solely based on performance of our hydraulic fracturing business. In fact, other C&P and D&E product service lines made meaningful contributions to both revenue and margins in North America in the second quarter. The increasing contribution from non-hydraulic fracturing product lines is important. It demonstrates our strategy to profitably grow our share of services per well both in North America and internationally and the results are showing. Despite the average quarterly rig count in North America dropping 13% since the first quarter, our cementing product line activity remained stable and margins grew quarter-over-quarter. We're able to achieve this with no additional capital by effectively utilizing assets and increasing the number of jobs per cement unit. As well complexity and lateral lengths increase in U.S. unconventionals, creating dependable well barriers and curing mud losses has become more critical. Built on a century of technical innovation our lost circulation solutions and light cement slurry's delivered results in the most challenging conditions, differentiating Halliburton from the competition. With tailored cement designs Halliburton executed the longest laterals to date in the DJ, Permian and Marcellus basins, with each lateral over three miles long. Our wireline and perforating product line continued to generate profitable growth driven by its diverse and competitive technology portfolio and exceptional service quality. In our North America perforating business, we're quickly gaining share with the proprietary integrated gun system. Halliburton velocity modular guns can be location preassembled and not require any field wiring, which makes them a lot easier faster and safer to deploy than conventional perforating guns. With velocity guns, we're delivering more than 400 runs between misruns, a fourfold improvement in service quality and efficiency compared to conventional guns. Modular guns have seen a very fast uptake with our customers, growing to 40% of the gun shot by Halliburton in just a year from launch. Our Artificial Lift business, which consists primarily of electric submersible pumps, continued to outpace the market. It delivered a record second quarter growing both revenue and profitability. ESPs have proven to be a very valuable asset in our production portfolio, serving both the conventional and unconventional markets. Looking forward, I believe that our customers' activity cadence for the rest of the year will be dictated by their focus on remaining within their announced CapEx budgets and generating free cash flow. Some will slowdown as they've been very efficient and will scale back completion programs for the rest of the year to stay within their CapEx guidance. Others may drop rigs, but will continue working down their docks. Majors will most likely continue executing their growth plans in the U.S. shale to meet their longer term objectives.  As a result of these different customer behaviors, we expect that activity in North America will be slightly down in the third quarter. We anticipate the slowdown to be more pronounced than gassier basins due to persisting lower gas prices. Despite the near-term softness in activity, we expect our margins to remain stable next quarter. We are taking the actions that allow us to protect margins and as evidenced by our second quarter C&P performance these actions are working. As we navigate 2019 and beyond our company is executing a different playbook than in the past. Here's what we are doing to keep delivering returns and cash flows to our investors. First, we recognize the changing behavior of our customers and have changed our own approach to capital spending. In 2019, we decreased CapEx 20% year-on-year and the majority of the reduction came from North America. We have sufficient size and scale in this market and see no reason to invest in growth when it comes at the expense of returns. The capital that we do spend this year in the U.S. is mostly directed towards increasing efficiency and refurbishing equipment, both with line of sight to improving returns and cash flow. Second, we're reducing our operating costs. For example, we recently restructured our North America organization, removing several layers of management. The restructuring has changed our cost profile certainly, but it's also increased our market responsiveness. We are also partnering with our premier supply chain and logistics organization to reduce our input costs. We continue to evaluate cost reduction opportunities across the company and we will manage and right-size our North America operations for the market environment. Finally, we have stacked additional equipment throughout the quarter and will continue to do so where we do not see acceptable returns. The pressure pumping market remains oversupplied and we're not afraid to reduce our fleet size, as it contributes to righting the supply and demand imbalance. This may impact our top line in the near term, but saves labor and maintenance costs and I believe will lead to better margins. We are taking these actions while continuing to drive growth in the product service lines that we expect to most positively contribute to profit and cash flow generation in North America. In my view, as unconventionals enter a maturation phase, represented by the pivot from scarcity to abundance, technology will differentiate Halliburton and I'm excited about our prospects. Customers are required to maximize production for every CapEx dollar they spend and technology that can improve well productivity will be key to their success. These are the challenges that Halliburton solves every day. For example, our automated fracturing service optimizes sand placement per lateral foot and ensures every cluster makes a meaningful contribution to well production. Our open-hole wireline business is growing in unconventionals, as customers spend time and money evaluating their reservoirs prior to fracturing them. We see increased use of fiber optics across various basins as operators aim to evaluate stimulation performance and make changes in realtime. And I am convinced that no one is better at collaborating with customers to engineer solutions that deliver the lowest cost per barrel than Halliburton. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lance for a financial update. Lance?
Lance Loeffler: Thank you, Jeff. Let's begin with an overview of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2019. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $550 million, representing increases of 3% and 29% respectively. Now let me turn to our divisional results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3.8 billion, representing an increase of $143 million or 4%. Operating income was $470 million, an increase of $102 million or 28%. These improvements were primarily driven by increased Cementing activity and completion tool sales internationally, higher artificial lift activity in North America, increased stimulation activity in North America and the Middle East/Asia and increased pipeline services in Europe/Africa/CIS. These results were offset by reduced stimulation activity in Latin America. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of $50 million or 2%. Operating income was $145 million, an increase of $22 million or 18%. These improvements were primarily driven by increased wireline activity globally, improved drilling activity in North America, Latin America and Europe/Africa/CIS and higher project management activity in Middle East/Asia. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced fluids activity in Latin America and North America and lower software revenue globally. Moving on to our geographical results. In North America, revenue in the second quarter of 2019 was $3.3 billion, a 2% increase. Improvements were primarily driven by higher stimulation artificial lift and wireline activity in North America land and higher drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico. These results were partially offset by a lower software revenue across the region and reduced fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue was $571 million, a 3% decrease sequentially, resulting primarily from lower software revenue and reduced fluids activity throughout the region, as well as reduced stimulation activity in Argentina. These reductions were partially offset by increased drilling and wireline in activity in Mexico and higher Cementing activity and completion tool sales in Argentina. Even though activity was slightly lower in Latin America this quarter, we expected to step up in the second half of the year, with a ramp up in Argentina, Guyana and Colombia. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. Revenue was $823 million, a 10% increase sequentially, primarily driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea and increased well construction services in Russia, partially offset by reduced software revenue throughout the region. In Middle East/Asia revenue was $1.2 billion, a 7% increase sequentially, largely resulting from higher completion tool sales and increased pressure pumping, wireline and project management activity throughout the region, coupled with improved drilling activity in Asia. These results were partially offset by lower drilling activity in the Middle East. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $65 million and we expect it to remain at these levels for the third quarter. During the second quarter, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $247 million, consisting primarily of asset impairments and severance costs. As Jeff discussed earlier, we continue to adjust our cost structure and footprint to the current operating environment in North America. Net interest expense for the quarter was $144 million and we expect it to remain approximately the same for the next reporting period. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 23%. Going forward, we anticipate our third quarter and 2019 full year effective tax rate to be 22% based on our expected earnings mix. We generated approximately $450 million of cash from operations during this quarter. We made progress in collecting our receivables while our inventory slightly increased related to our strategic technology deployments. We expect inventory to be consumed through the rest of the year and I see second quarter as a step in the right direction as we generated positive free cash flow. We will continue to target working capital as a key focus for the organization. On a full year basis, we believe, working capital levels will be essentially flat with 2018. And for the full year, we still expect to generate free cash flow at or above 2018 levels. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $408 million and our 2019 full year CapEx guidance remains unchanged. While our CapEx of $1.6 billion this year is similar to our DD&A level, we anticipate capital spend in 2020 to be significantly less than that. This level of spend will still allow us to capitalize on the international growth while being responsive to the market conditions in North America. At Halliburton, CapEx is at the core of our strategy execution. Our capital allocation behavior drives the right returns discussions both internally and with our customers and this is consistent with our focus on generating strong cash flow for our investors regardless of the market environment. Finally, we continue our focus on delivering shareholder returns. During the second quarter we returned approximately $260 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Now, turning to our near-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with some comments on how we believe the third quarter is shaping up. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect activity increases in the North Sea and Asia to be offset by lower activity in Africa and North America. All-in, we expect sequential revenue to be up low single digits with margins increasing 125 to 175 basis points as we see the impact of the catalyst for D&E margin improvement that Jeff described earlier. At our Completion and Production division, lower activity in North America will be offset by higher activity internationally and the impact of our cost reduction efforts. As a result, we believe that sequential revenue will be down low single digits with margins expected to remain essentially flat. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for the closing comments. Jeff?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Lance. To summarize our discussion today, momentum is building internationally and activity improvement should continue into 2020. Leading edge pricing is trending upward as equipment supply and demand balance tightens in various geographies. Halliburton has the footprint and the expanded technology portfolio to capitalize on this international growth. We recognize the changing behavior of our North American customers and are executing a new playbook to keep generating returns and free cash flow. Halliburton is taking the right actions to be successful in this market. We have cut overall CapEx in 2019 and plan to do so in 2020 as well. This is driving the right capital allocation decisions and pricing and returns discussions. We are reducing our operating costs. We have restructured our North American organization and are also partnering with our premier supply chain and logistics organization to reduce our input costs. We have stacked additional equipment throughout the quarter and will continue to do so with a focus on returns. We are strategically growing our share of services per well by increasing the competitiveness of our non-hydraulic fracturing product service lines. And finally, we're developing technologies that will improve well productivity, a requirement of a mature unconventional market. We remain focused on delivering consistent execution, generating superior financial performance and providing industry leading shareholder returns. And now let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. James, your line is open. Please check your mute button.
Jeff Miller: James, you there?
Operator: Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Angie Sedita: Thanks. Good Morning, guys.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Angie.
Angie Sedita: So I thought I was interested in your comments. Let's start on the international side for a change and the momentum you're seeing going into even 2020. Maybe you can give us a little incremental color on the degree of momentum we could see next year. Could we see similar growth levels for revenue in the international markets as you did in 2018? And then on the pricing side, do you expect it to continue to be region-specific or could it become more widespread?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Thanks, Angie. International doesn’t move as fast as for example North America. So, when we see a trajectory, it tends to stay on that trajectory. And I'm encouraged by 2020 because of the number of FIDs and types of things that we're seeing today that really don't get started until 2020. So the Kuwait, for example, doesn't really begin until the middle of next year though it was won now. And so, the FIDs that we're seeing now, give me confidence about the trajectory for 2020. You're early to call growth rates for next year. But yeah, I think you meant 2019 when I see a similar kind of growth trajectory 2019 that carried over into 2020. And yeah that seems reasonable to me.
Angie Sedita: Okay. Okay, helpful. And then on the North America land market, some -- first kudos for being proactive on stacking equipment in this market versus flighting for share. You commented that you're seeing pricing as stable, and one of your peers said they are seeing some pricing softness. So maybe you could talk a little bit about pricing and then the degree of drop off that we could see in Q3 and even into Q4 as far as activity?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, Angie let me start with pricing. I mean from our perspective it was stable for us through Q2. That doesn't mean there isn't occasionally something that we see in terms of pricing behavior by a competitor. But on balance, very stable. As we look at the balance of the year certainly from an activity standpoint, I've said it would be down slightly in Q3. Obviously, Q4 always comes with weather seasonality all of that, I suspect given budgets that we would see more step down as well around that. But I think what's really important here is as you described it the way we're approaching the market, I mean our playbook is different. We're very sharp around taking costs out where we see it needs to come out. We've demonstrated that we do stack equipment, will stack equipment and are just dead focused on returns and margins. And so that's kind of the way we see the second half of the year. Obviously customer spend through Q2, we don't know that yet. But when we do know that, I think that will also be instructive on the second half of the year. We talk to our customers, so we know what they're thinking, but the fact is we need to look at where those budgets come out in Q2. And I guess just one follow-up on international pricing you'd ask that question Angie. We're seeing international pricing. It is getting traction. It's getting traction around tool shortages and demand in certainly the North Sea. We've seen it in a few other markets as well. And I think that's part of what we see from our standpoint anyway that the capital discipline that we're driving is driving the right conversations with customers, and quite frankly the right choices by us.
Angie Sedita: Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Sean Meakim: Thanks. Hi, good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Sean.
Sean Meakim: So Jeff, you mentioned that you're working from a different playbook, given this is a different cycle and I certainly agree with that approach. And it seems like your thinking is evolving in terms of how you're looking at CapEx next year. Could you maybe just walk us through a little bit of flex points? I know it's still a bit early in the year, but how you're thinking about some of the flex around putting that budget together. I think one of the most common questions investors are wrestling with now is, for Halliburton, with the largest legacy frac fleet, how electric frac may or may not factor into those thoughts into next year? Could you help, maybe frame that out for us a little bit?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, Sean. I mean, we're in the early planning around CapEx for 2020. Clearly, we're in the early planning stages. But I wouldn't have highlighted if it wasn't going to be meaningful. So, just to kind of discuss CapEx 2020, we believe firmly that we don't sacrifice growth and opportunities internationally, and we still have room to grow in North America if customer budgets support that, important, the kind of behavior and decisions that capital scarcity is driving, and we will then continue that into 2020. With respect to electric fleets, this is -- this is something we also we know a lot about and we've been testing those and had a fleet in the field for some time now. So, this isn't new to us. But it's also -- we're going to be thoughtful about where and how we deploy capital. So, as we look at that particular space, that's -- the market is over-supplied. And so, when we get to the end of every year, when we think about CapEx, some part of the fleet rolls off every year and we look at that. And at that point, we're presented with choices and this is around replacement. Do we replace that asset with a quiet fleet or a dual fuel fleet or in this case could be an electric fleet? So, I mean, I see that lift from our standpoint as an evolution, but we don't see customers willing to pay more for that today. So that's kind of how we frame electric right now.
Sean Meakim: I appreciate that. Thank you for that feedback. And then Lance, I mean, can we talk a little bit more about working capital? You mentioned the inventory build in the first half of the year and your expectation that that will convert to a source of cash in the back half. How would you characterize collections across the different operator types at this stage? Are we in a fairly normalized environment or there's still some challenges here? How would you frame out that impact as we look at the back half of 2019?
Lance Loeffler: Yes. Sean thanks for the question. So, look over the last two years, we've generated over $1 billion of free cash flow and I expect that that trend continues in 2019. Now we've got work to do in the second half of the year, but the path to that free cash flow generation first starts with sort of margin improvement in 2H, particularly with our D&E business, right? But it also includes making progress on collection. We saw DSO improvement from Q1 to Q2 and I suspect that that will continue throughout the course of the second half of the year. In terms of inventory that you mentioned, it is true. We've invested a considerable amount in inventory in the first half of the year as we continue to deploy iCruise and our Sperry technology deployment as well as I expect us to burn that down in the second half of the year in addition to the normal traditional completion tool delivery that we expect in the back half of the year. So, I think both of those will be momentum adding to our free cash flow. Now, I'd also point out too, our rate of spend in CapEx was heavier in the first half of the year which is not unusual. We reiterated our guidance around the $1.6 billion of spend in this year. So it will have a slower rate of spend in the second half as well.
Sean Meakim: Got it. Thank you for all the details.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
James West: Hey, good morning, guys.
Jeff Miller: Hi James.
James West: So you can hear me now, right?
Jeff Miller: Yes. We can hear you.
James West: Okay. Good. All right, good. Sorry about that. That was a phone issue today. So my first question Jeff, international here we're starting to see some acceleration. As you look out into 2020 likely to see volumes at or maybe even above kind of current growth levels, plus you're going to get some offshore, plus you got some pricing. Could we be in a scenario where we start to dip into the kind of double-digit type of growth internationally in 2020?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean James, I'm not ready to call 2020 at this point, but there's no reason not to believe that's possible. I think, the thing we're going to stay dead focused on though going into 2020 are going to be margins and we want profitable growth. And I think, we demonstrated with where we are we can grow and we've grown quite a bit internationally. But we're going to again keep a sharp eye on margins as that market unfolds.
James West: Okay. Good. Fair enough. And pricing obviously is a big part of that margin profile. What's the level -- when you're having these conversations, I know you're on the road a lot in the international markets, what's the level of push back on pricing, or is the market now understanding hey, we're tight. Equipment's tight and you need to generate adequate return?
Jeff Miller: Well it's a mixed bag. I mean I would say that our state customers look at that scenario and realize that service pricing isn't adequate and returns aren't adequate and need the work done well and we have a lot more success with those customers and that's a bigger group of customer. It gets to be a bigger group of customer all of the time. It also helps when we say or demonstrate that tools are sold out and we can do that by making choices and so that also helps.  Our service quality that Halliburton has is a level quite frankly I've never seen it before. And so what we have to offer is a fantastic product and so we're very comfortable talking about pricing today.
James West: Got it. Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citi.
Scott Gruber: Yes, good morning. 
Jeff Miller: Good morning Scott.
Scott Gruber: So I wanted to come back to e-frac. I realize it's early days for the technology, but assuming that a strong demand pull does materialize for the technology, would you look at e-frac capacity at a rate that approximates your share in the market relative to the industry build-out? Would you look to invest more slowly to enhance free cash flow even at the risk of seeing your share within e-frac that it's smaller than your current share? How do you think about balancing e-frac share with free cash flow and is that an important factor for you?
Jeff Miller: Look returns are first and foremost for us. And so we looked at all of this in terms of returns. From a share perspective, the pace that I'm describing actually is perfectly adequate if we're happy with the returns and the technology deployment to keep up with where we are in the market. That's just sort of a normal replacement schedule that we're already on. It's just how we make those choices around what we replace. From our perspective it's going to have to be a more efficient lower capital endeavor or somehow make better returns than what's out there today or it doesn't proliferate. That's not saying we don't participate, but what I'm saying is I want to make certain that the Halliburton approach around really power and pumps, we love the pumps that we have together are making a return. And at least where we see it today it's not a -- it's more capital for the same or less returns so that's not really where we want to be.
Scott Gruber: Got you. And then just turning to D&E. Lance based on the guidance that you provided it does look like a more material ramp in revenue and margin that's required in 4Q to achieve the flattish year-on-year. Something like almost maybe over 100% incrementals. Not sure if that's possible. I'm just trying to play around with some numbers and using mid-single-digit growth. But that rate it looks like the incrementals would have to be quite large. How are you thinking about 4Q shaping up from a revenue and incremental perspective if the elements are still there for flattish margins on the year-over-year basis?
Lance Loeffler: Look I think we'll see -- we'll continue to see continued momentum in terms of the activity that we're doing in places like the North Sea and India. We're also going to have in the fourth quarter we've got visibility this year just given the strength of the international recovery more than we've had in prior -- in the last several years around software sales that will also be a tailwind to that. But I think to come back to it, look D&E produced 44% I believe incrementals just 1Q to 2Q. I think that clearly the international recovery helps that business and what we've been talking about. But what we're trying to describe right in terms of the tale of two halves is a business that, while it was weighed down by certain things or from certain timing perspectives as we continue to deploy our new Sperry technology is that you're going to see a market difference in the two halves of the year. And I think that's the message that we're trying to communicate to The Street.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate the color.
Lance Loeffler: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is open.
Bill Herbert: Thanks good morning. Lance just sticking with D&E for a second here. So get the fact. I mean you've been consistently persuasive with regard to the difference between first half and second half in terms of what drives D&E margins. But just trying to get -- is the -- to reiterate the question, is the conviction relatively high and we're going to be in the neighborhood of flat margins year-over-year for D&E second half which implies kind of 13% to 14% margins in Q4? Sorry to beat a dead horse here.
Lance Loeffler: Yes. Look I think Bill, I said on the prior call that we'd be sort of flattish or in the ballpark. I think look, there's a lot of stuff that we've got to go out and execute but the tailwinds behind what we have looking forward for D&E for the second half of the year paint a very different picture in terms of margin profile than they did in the first half.
Jeff Miller: That means, Bill the mobilizations we clearly see those and those are finishing, finishing now. Sperry technology implementation certainly helps. There are other D&E technologies that we're rolling out. They're equally helpful. I talked about some of them on the call velocity guns other things ramping. And then the visibility around not just software but year-end product sales is better than it's been in the past. And so, I think we're confident around -- the catalysts are intact. We can't prescribe the cadence necessarily, but certainly second half ramps up.
Bill Herbert: No, right. Thank you. And again I get the conceptual build influx. I'm just trying to get to a specific number within reason, but I hear you. Second question for me kind of multifaceted, first, if you could rank the C&P margin improvement, contribution quarter-on-quarter. And what I'm trying to get as is to what extent did product sales drive the margin improvement? And then also what percentage of your frac fleet is stacked now? Thank you. 
Jeff Miller: I'll sort of start with sort of your question around sort of the allocation on C&P margins. But I think look -- Completion Tools had a great, great quarter. But I think the majority of what we're doing in terms of making sure that we're managing costs in North America is reflected in some of the C&P performance as well. I mean, we're being decisive or moving quickly and we're seeing the results and I think that's what's important.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And with regard to the percentage of your fleet that's stacked?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Bill, I mean, we're not going into competitive specifics. I think you're in the market so you have a sense of what that is. I think the point is that we are continuing to stack equipment when it doesn't make sense. And I think that will come with slightly lower revenues, but certainly higher margins.
Bill Herbert: Okay. Thank you, sir.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning. So, I guess, I wanted to talk a little bit about the preassembled perf gun solution that you mentioned earlier on the call. Could you talk about the solution that you have and maybe compare it to some of the market leaders out there? And then maybe just kind of talk about how this impacts the integrated frac solution that you're trying to push out into the market?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. So this is very competitive tool. In fact, we're fortunate, because we've got a solid manufacturing business in Alvarado, Texas where we've been building and making charges for years. So as velocity guns go into the market highly effective. We have the ability to tailor those as required for different configurations, which is a benefit certainly to us. And it's also part of bringing down in my view the overall, I'd just say cost. This is the effectiveness around integrated wireline in North America. So we can change actually the way that we work to get to a lower cost and better performance, which is different than just having two things sitting out there together. It changes the -- not just the number of people, but who is doing what allows us -- the velocity guns allow us to change the certainly the technical content on-location reduces the number of misruns or misfires. And I'm really excited about the volume. I mean, we described it as 40% of the goal gun shot by Halliburton, which is a lot of guns. But we see actually the potential to continue to drive unit cost of those guns down as the volume continues to grow. So that -- it's one of the things that just gets more competitive over time.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. All right. That makes sense. Appreciate the color. And then coming back to Sperry a little bit, I mean, obviously you guys have been investing a lot in Sperry. Could you talk about when we think about Sperry and potentially leveraging and working closer with land rig companies and the opportunity to kind of have a better penetration to some of your kind of leading edge Sperry technology?
Jeff Miller: Look, those are all things we look at. I think the really the rotary steerables and motors are very different animals in the marketplace. What we're doing in rotary steerables is really exciting for many. I mean, this is a fantastic piece of kit, and it's very integrated into sort of data and real-time and not just real-time, but automation, so, really excited about that. I've always been clear that we didn't want to be aligned with just one, for example, contractor. I believe that if you look at North America, it's an open architecture market, and there is a lot of choice that can be exercised by customers. So, we've always been really careful to make sure of what we put in the market is functional with lots of providers. And so that's sort of a one thing certainly around the rotary steerables. In the motor, I talked last quarter about our Motors Center of Excellence. And I'm really excited about that, because it allows us now to customize solutions for our clients around motor performance. So there is a lot of variability in terms of the rock and performance of motors. And having that in-house allows us not only to do the customization, but also retain the learning and bake that into a very efficient sort of turnaround in 24-hour type business. So that's something that how we align it with operator is interesting, but the way I think more about it is, how does it from a value proposition standpoint work best for us and I think we've got it there now.
Chase Mulvehill: All right. I appreciate the color. Very helpful. Thanks Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Your line is open.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Kurt.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead: Hey. So I have first question. I appreciate the color in the context of you guys stacking equipment and being capital disciplined on as it relates to U.S. frac-related businesses. Wondering if you guys can give us some sense on what the attrition dynamics might be, whether that's industry or as you look at your own frac fleet? How are you thinking about stacking equipment versus let's just say retiring equipment?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. I think the -- we're always managing the fleet, I guess, is the way I would say that. And there's clearly always -- when we have a big fleet it gives us the ability to retire, replenish, repair, and in my view replace and so we take all of that together. Some equipment that stack is ready to go back. Some equipment that comes out of the system is actually the equipment I was describing that is being retired where we have choice around how we replace that equipment and at what pace. So, I think the -- we're really careful with the fleet that way. There's no question that equipment is working harder and attrition is occurring in the marketplace. We don't see capital spend going up. We just don't see new equipment coming into the market and we know how hard it's working. So, all of that conspires to drive attrition. As I've always said it's hard to see the pace of attrition until there's a call on the equipment. I suspect there will be at some point, but I do know that the physics of pumping fluid and sand through steel is having its effect on broadly the fleet in North America, all fleets in North America.
Kurt Hallead: Yeah. That's great color. Appreciate that, Jeff. And then maybe for Lance. You gave some really good additional color on the D&E margin dynamics for the rest of the year. I was wondering if you'd maybe give us some insights as well on Completion and Production. And typically when you see a revenue decline in a certain business segment the margins would decline along with it. You guys have given specific data points here that suggest that even though revenues are going to decline for C&P in the third quarter margins are going to kind of hold flat. Do you think they have that kind of internal business momentum where your cost structure is down, your efficiencies are at such a level that even if C&P were to decline again in the fourth quarter you can -- your margins could be stable?
Lance Loeffler: Yeah. I mean that's a good question, Kurt. Look I think, obviously, we've got one quarter out so I'll save any of the specificity for next quarter's call in the fourth quarter. But I mean that's the intent. That's what we're working towards right? I mean that's what we talk about in terms of continuing to manage cost in North America and controlling what we can control. But we'll give a better view when we get to the third quarter call on what fourth quarter looks like for C&P.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. That’s great. Nice, really appreciate the color. Thank you.
Lance Loeffler: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.
David Anderson: Hey, Jeff I was just wondering if you could maybe just dig into a little bit on the evolution of this new playbook in North America. I know you have a new head of Western Hemisphere, Mark Richard in there who is I think been putting his view in there as well. But as far as -- as long as I can remember HAL always sought market share during the downturn now you're stacking equipment. It sounds like EBITDA per fleet may be improving as well. I guess -- is that almost early confirmation of the playbook? But probably if you can just give us a little background as to how you arrived at this new playbook?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Just to cut to the chase, yes. The answer is yes. What you're seeing is that new playbook in action. But the -- what we recognize is there's a change in the customer spending patterns. And when that changes it has to -- we want to address the best returns. And so what was the right playbook several years ago when there was a different cadence and pace of customers spend today needs to change and so that's what you're seeing in action. And so we're going to be super sharp around capital into the downturn. I say the downturn but what we see is slowing activity that I described for Q3. What we want to make sure is that we are -- if it's slightly down we want to be slightly there with our CapEx. But most importantly -- not our CapEx our capital equipment. But what's most important to us is that we're not waiting on the spring back. We've demonstrated we know how to add people back to the system and equipment back when it's required, so I'm quite comfortable that reflects down when the prices go below something that is making a return for us and we'll let somebody else do that at below return cost. So I hope that's clear. But that's the way we're thinking about – that’s not how we're thinking about it that's how we're executing on the new playbook.
David Anderson: So in this new playbook, do you view each of your product lines and service lines separately? In other words each one of them have to basically hit certain return hurdles? How are you viewing -- because in the past we've talked about bundled models and integrated model and whatnot, but this sounds like we'll get more defining each one of our product lines has to stand on its own. Is that fair to say?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, that's fair. Though I would say we like integrated work and we do a lot of that in the North Sea, we do a lot of that around the world and we're happy doing that when it's available in North America. But at the same time, yes, everything has to make a return. And part of the reorganization in North America was around cost, but equally so was around speed of decision-making and executing each of those service lines. And I'm really pleased to report with the North America spend down in the first half of the year, our non-frac revenue per rig was up 13% year-on-year. So, that's evidence of that sharp focus around all of those service lines.
David Anderson: So, one of those service lines you called out is Artificial Lift and you talked about that being a driver of the higher NAM revenue. I was just wondering if you could just talk about that market in general in lift and how that compares -- how other lines product lines are trending. How is the spend and the pace of lift installations? How has that trended this year? We all know about the ESP capital that's -- what it's doing to drilling completions. But what's going on with lift? Is that still kind of holding up pretty well? Do you expect it to hold up well? Could you just provide a little color on how the market is trending.
Jeff Miller: Yes. Dave I mean I feel like that's OpEx spend by clients and it's really important that they produce and support production and that means every well needs to work. And that's part of the reason we've talked about growing our production business. And I say growing and building out production because OpEx and production matters a lot to our customers. And I think that's what you're seeing in the ESP business because it's an effective way for clients to prove production. But chemicals in some ways falls along the same lines so excited about those businesses.
David Anderson: Okay. Thanks Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Dave.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thank you, Shannon. Before we close, I'd just like to reemphasize a couple of points. First, I'm excited about the international recovery, the growth for the balance of 2019, and the momentum that's building into 2020. In North America, we plan to execute our new playbook reducing costs, stacking fleets, and reducing CapEx that drives better margins and free cash flows for 2019 and 2020. Our focus on non-frac service lines is a terrific opportunity for Halliburton and our organization is well-positioned to deliver profitable growth. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter and Shannon, please close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining and have a wonderful day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator instructions] And as a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Abu Zeya. Please go ahead.
Abu Zeya: Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2019 conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of impairments and other charges. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release and can be found in the Investor Downloads section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. What a difference 90 days make in this market. Commodity prices have rebounded, customer budgets are refreshed and we're back to work. Our results for the first quarter played out as we expected and I'm pleased with how our organization executed both in North America and internationally. Here are the first quarter highlights. Total company revenue of $5.7 billion was essentially flat compared to the first quarter of 2018 and adjusted operating income was $426 million. International revenue increased 11% year-over-year, which was a great first step towards our expectation of high single-digit international growth for all of 2019. Our Drilling and Evaluation division had a strong year-over-year revenue growth of 7% with activity improvements across all geographic regions. Finally, as expected, hydraulic fracturing activity ramped up in U.S land as customers refreshed their budgets. And despite pricing headwinds, our execution resulted in delivering better than expected margins in our Completion and Production division. From a macro perspective, 2019 is off to a strong start. Commodity prices have been rising since the beginning of the year due to tightening oil supplies and stable demand. OPEC plus production cuts and supply disruptions from Venezuela, Iran and Libya have supported market rebalancing. Oil demand trends, particularly in China and India, have also been constructive. Overall, the macro environment remains favorable for our industry. Against this backdrop and with winter behind us, customer activity in both hemispheres has picked up off December lows and continues to trend higher. Although we often discuss the hydraulic fracturing business in North America, it's important to remember that Halliburton has a portfolio of 14 product service lines operating in North America. For example, our artificial lift and cementing businesses showed excellent results in the first quarter, growing both revenue and margin year-over-year. Our artificial lift product line grew top line revenues 55% year-over-year in the first quarter driven by strong demand for ESPs that are now installed much sooner in the life of the well and sometimes right after the wells put on production. Halliburton is the number one cementing provider in U.S. land. Demand for our cementing services continue to be strong in the first quarter. Congratulations to our artificial lift and cementing teams for an outstanding performance. Now let's turn to our North America land hydraulic fracturing business. We experienced an increase in the stages pumped every month this quarter with March finishing on a high note. Overall, the first quarter activity level was modestly higher compared to the first quarter of 2018. As expected, we had pricing headwinds throughout the quarter. However, we believe the worst in the pricing deterioration is now behind us. And as we’ve discussed in the past, the success of our hydraulic fracturing business is not dependent on pricing alone. Given our presence in all basins and exposure to all customer groups, we have the ability to pull other levers such as utilization, cost savings and operational efficiency to drive a better outcome for our business. Let me describe what I believe will happen with hydraulic fracturing supply and demand throughout 2019. On the demand side, it's evolving as we had anticipated. Our customers have announced their 2019 budgets and we expect that overall spend will be down 6% to 10% in North America. Here is how I see the impact of our customers' 2019 budgets on the North America land stimulation services business. I expect that customers will operate within their budgets largely by achieving savings through sand cost deflation and by reducing drilling activity. On the other hand, I believe that net completions activity will remain essentially flat year-on-year as our customer seek to achieve their publicized production targets. In the near-term, our view on North American customer activity heading into the second quarter is shaped by the momentum that we saw building at the end of March. As for the next couple of quarters, I see demand for our services progressing modestly. The cadence of spend across basins for various companies will look different throughout the year, but Halliburton has the scale, range of services and customer relationships that capture more than anyone else out of every dollar spent in North America land this year. Now let's talk about the supply side. Given the demand landscape, the service industry is adjusted accordingly and cut capital spend. Currently, new horse power is not being added to the market. At the same time, the existing equipment is working a lot harder today, leading to equipment attrition. The key driver of this is service intensity, which quickly translates into shorter equipment lives and higher maintenance costs. Let me give you some data points to put this in perspective. Halliburton is currently pushing 30% more sand volume through equipment than in 2016. The shift to local sand that is finer and more abrasive also leads to more equipment wear. Customers are drilling longer laterals and fracking more stages per well. Last year we fracked 20% more stages per horsepower than we did in 2016. And with increased efficiency, we've improved utilization, achieving more pumping hours per day. Again, more wear and tear. Industry sources estimate that about 7.5 million hydraulic horsepower will need to be rebuilt in 2019 to maintain a flat horsepower supply. This equates to $1.7 billion in equipment spend that I do not see forthcoming as the service companies have cut capital spending plans. As a result of these factors, I believe the capacity attrition will occur naturally throughout the year and that there will be less horsepower available in the market at the end of the year than there is today. Halliburton will significantly reduce North America hydraulic fracturing CapEx this year. We have sufficient size and scale in the market today and see no reason to invest in growth when it comes at the expense of returns. The capital that we do spend will be mostly directed towards improving efficiency, reducing emissions and refurbishing equipment. I'm frequently asked when will we add hydraulic fracturing capacity again? Let me tell you, I don't see that happening until the market has better supply and demand balance and substantially better pricing. And despite the ongoing market rebalancing I just described, the market conditions are not conducive to adding capacity. In this market we are focused on maintaining the right level of capital spending to support our business. But most importantly, on continuing to deliver strong cash flow and [technical difficulty] returns. As the North America land market rebalances over the next few quarters, we will continue to control what we can control. We're positioning ourselves to outperform the market even if demand is substantially different from what we currently expect. I already mentioned our CapEx reduction. That was the first step. Second, we're reorganizing our structure in North America land to be more nimble and operate more efficiently. This will make us more effective in any market. Third, I often talk about continuous improvement. I want to make it clear that this is not a temporary initiative at Halliburton. It's part of who we are as a company. We are constantly looking for ways to eliminate waste and improve productivity in all parts of our organization, from technology to training, from supply chain to field operations. And we will continue to drive cost and capital efficiency throughout our company. Finally, and most importantly, we are a returns driven organization and where pricing concessions would've pushed returns below an acceptable threshold, we've instead elected to stack equipment, including frac fleets. Emerging from the industry's focus on cash flow and returns, we see stable growth over a longer period of time. This sustained growth will be good for Halliburton. It will allow us to leverage our supply chain and logistics infrastructure, drive asset velocity, capture efficiencies around our repair and maintenance programs, and implement technologies at scale to reduce costs and increase production. Therefore, we can be more efficient with our investments. Halliburton is well positioned to navigate the near-term and thrive in the long run. Our company is 100 years old and we got here by evolving with our market and our customers. We will continue to do so in the future. Turning to international markets, I'm excited by what I see. The international recovery continues to build momentum. Halliburton has gained share in key international markets over the last several years. This gives us a strong base to capitalize on the recovery and we expect high single-digit international revenue growth this year. The international recovery was initially led by the national oil companies and focused on mature fields. Now the offshore markets are also entering recovery mode as project economics become more attractive. International offshore spending is projected to be up 14% in 2019 and the average offshore international rig count increased 29% year-on-year in the first quarter. A great example of an emerging offshore rebound is our recent win with Shell in Brazil. In the first quarter we started work on Shell's three-year integrated well construction campaign in the Santos and Campos basins offshore Brazil. These are some of the most complex, but also most prolific basins in the world. Halliburton is excited to collaborate with Shell on the first green shoots of long-term activity recovery in this critical deepwater market. Middle East activity is increasing, driven by rig additions in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. However, we expect pricing pressures in the Middle East to continue in the near-term. A steady volume of activity and excess equipment capacity in the region continue to drive competitiveness. Going forward, a call on production and tightening spare capacity should lead to positive pricing movements. The North Sea is showing pricing improvement with available drilling equipment capacity essentially absorbed. However, we expect margin pressure to remain for the first half of the year as we optimize performance on our competitively priced long-term contracts and continue to incur mobilization cost. Activity ramp-up continues across Asia Pacific and Africa with the rig counts in both regions now the highest level since the first quarter of 2015. We are starting to see pockets of pricing improvement in these areas as they come back from the downturn low. Latin America activity will improve this year driven by Mexico and Argentina. I'm excited about the near-term growth and long-term potential in that region. As we see more capacity tightness internationally and the pipeline of projects progressively expands, we expect to continue demonstrating rational returns driven growth in the international markets. The pricing discussions with our customers in some markets have become more constructive and we expect this momentum to build going into 2020. As the rationalization of the U.S shale industry unfolds and the international markets ramp-up, Halliburton is best positioned to capitalize on the future opportunities. We make thousands of decisions every day and our global presence, our diversified products and service portfolio, our culture, our processes and our depth of leadership will allow us to win. We will win through responsible capital stewardship, prioritizing capital efficiency, investing in the technologies that deliver differentiation and generating strong cash flow and returns. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Then I will return to discuss how we are strategically positioned to differentiate ourselves in the current market and deliver returns for our shareholders. Lance?
Lance Loeffler: Thanks, Jeff. Let's begin with an overview of our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2018. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion, essentially flat year-over-year, while adjusted operating income was $426 million, a 31% decrease. Now let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue was $3.7 billion, a decrease of 4% and operating income was $368 million, a decrease of 26%. These results were primarily driven by increased stimulation activity in North America, which was offset by lower pricing. The Completion and Production division also benefited from higher artificial lift and cementing activity in U.S land, increased stimulation activity in Latin America and higher completion tool sales in the Middle East/Asia and Latin America regions. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased 7% to $2.1 billion, driven by activity improvement across all regions. Operating income was $123 million, a decrease of 35%. These results were primarily driven by mobilization cost that we incurred on multiple international drilling projects, coupled with reduced project management activity and lower pricing in the Middle East. Moving to our geographical results. In North America, revenue decreased 7%, primarily driven by lower pricing in stimulation services, partially offset by higher artificial lift, cementing and stimulation services activity. Latin America revenue increased 28%. This increase was driven by higher activity for the majority of our product service lines in Mexico, increased stimulation work in Argentina and improved fluids activity throughout the region, partially offset by reduced drilling and testing activity in Brazil. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue grew 4% driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in Ghana and the United Kingdom. These results were partially offset by lower drilling activity in Azerbaijan. In Middle East/Asia revenue increased 7% year-over-year, largely resulting from higher completion tool sales across the region, coupled with increased project management activity in India and improved drilling activity in the Middle East. These improvements were offset by reduced fluids activity and lower pricing in the Middle East. In the first quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $65 million, which is in line with our previous guidance. We expect corporate expense in the second quarter to remain approximately the same. During the quarter, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $61 million, primarily related to a non-cash impairment of legacy sand delivery equipment as we've adopted a more efficient sand logistic solution. Net interest expense for the quarter was $143 million and we expect it to remain approximately the same for the next reporting period. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 21%. Going forward, we expect our second quarter and 2019 full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was a use of cash of $44 million, primarily driven by short-term working capital movements. We experienced some customer payment delays that should get resolved as the second quarter progresses. We've also built up inventory primarily for the international rollout of our strategic investments, and we plan to work this inventory down throughout the year. Historically, it's not unusual for our cash flow to the backend loaded and we expect to generate strong operating cash flow for the remainder of 2019. Capital expenditures during the quarter were $437 million with our 2019 full-year CapEx firm at $1.6 billion. On a full-year basis, we expect to generate higher free cash flow than last year by engaging the appropriate levers in different markets. Optimizing capacity and structure in North America, driving pricing improvements and contract optimization internationally and managing working capital and CapEx. Now turning to our near-term operational outlook, let me provide you with some comments on how we believe the second quarter is shaping up. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we are anticipating a second quarter rebound from typical seasonal disruptions in drilling activity, offset by ongoing mobilizations. Therefore, we expect sequential revenue to be up low single digits with margins increasing 50 to 150 basis points. In our Completion and Production division, with North America land activity improving and the worst in pricing deterioration behind us, we believe that revenues will increase mid single digits, while margin should be up 50 to150 basis points. Now I will turn the call back over to Jeff to highlight some of our ongoing strategic initiatives and make a few closing comments. Jeff?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Lance. More than ever we're focused on exercising prudent capital allocation to the right priorities. We have solid long-term strategies aligned with value generation for our shareholders. We will continue to expand in the product service lines and penetrate the markets where we see opportunities to generate growth and returns. As we implement these strategies, we expect to generate economic and technical differentiation that will lead to higher returns and free cash flow. There are three main areas where we're investing this year and I will walk you through each one of them. First, we will continue to enhance the competitiveness of our Sperry drilling product line. I’ve talked to you a lot about iCruise, the new rotary steerable platform we introduced last year. The global rollout of this advanced drilling technology is on track with the tool already working in Argentina, the Middle East and across the U.S shale basins. We are currently building out the tool inventory and by the end of 2019, iCruise will constitute over a third of our rotary steerable fleet. Growth in the higher margin rotary steerable market is extremely encouraging, but conventional motors remain the workhorse of directional drilling, especially on land. Another initiative we undertook at Sperry to increase our competitiveness and differentiation was to launch our Motors Center of Excellence. It is a new approach to drilling motor development that combines specialized engineering and manufacturing capabilities to customize motor designs for specific basin challenges. The center deploys the latest mechanical engineering expertise to build more durable motors that drill faster and allow for longer runs with a higher rate of penetration. We have assembled a dedicated team of scientists in bearing and power section design, polymer chemistry and materials that is focused on accelerating research and development activities to deliver differentiated drilling motors to the industry. As part of our Motors Center of Excellence, last quarter we opened two new reline facilities equipped with state-of-the-art technology and strategically located in Houston and Saudi Arabia to serve our customers in the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Next we will continue investing in our production businesses, artificial lift and specialty chemicals. They’re critical to both unconventionals and mature fields that fit well within our existing product portfolio and they have a lot of growth potential for Halliburton going forward. This year will be all about international expansion for these businesses. It is already well underway for artificial lift offering. We opened a testing and disassembly facility in the Middle East and are making ESP deliveries in several countries in Latin America and in the Middle East. Plans for international manufacturing of ESPs are in the works as well. I recently went to Saudi Arabia to attend a groundbreaking ceremony for Halliburton's first chemical manufacturing plant in the Eastern Hemisphere. Leveraging the expertise added through the Athlon acquisition last year, we are building a plant that will provide an advantage location for Halliburton to deliver superior service and chemical applications expertise to our Eastern Hemisphere customers. Upon completion in 2020, the plant will have capabilities to manufacture a broad slate of chemicals for stimulation, production, midstream and downstream engineered treatment programs. We will not only supply our customers with next generation specialty chemical solutions, but will also be able to manufacture chemicals for our own drilling fluids, cementing and stimulation businesses. Finally, the third focus area for this year. We will continue to differentiate in a very important, but highly competitive space in hydraulic fracturing. The intense exploration of top-tier acreage, fueled by rapid trial-and-error technology cycles led to the explosive increase in production from US unconventionals that we've seen in the past decade. As Shale matures and operators have to step out to second tier acreage, it will become increasingly hard to add enough production capacity to replace a significant legacy decline volumes as well as drive new production higher. Going forward, higher activity and more advanced technology will be needed to maintain flat production levels in unconventionals. In light of this, I firmly believe that the future of unconventional technology will be more heavily weighted towards enabling higher well productivity.
.: On a recent application in North Dakota's Williston basin, Prodigi enabled more even distribution of profit and fluid to each cluster, resulting in a 30% increase in cluster efficiency. This is just the beginning of what Prodigi will provide as we continue to work smarter going forward. And Halliburton is best positioned to develop and deploy the advanced technologies that will ultimately improve well performance. With shale maturation, capital discipline on both the operator and the services side and an escalating focus on technology and efficiency, we expect customers to demand both surface execution and subsurface effectiveness. It won't just be about getting the most number of stages fracked today. Improving the quality of those stages and their production output will be just as important. In this environment a strong integrated franchise will matter; size and scale matter will matter, technology depth will matter; superior service quality will matter; customer collaboration will matter; and Halliburton has all of these. In summary, a supply and demand rebalance in North America land over the next few quarters, Halliburton is well positioned to navigate the near-term and thrive in the long run. Second, a broad-based recovery is ongoing internationally and will continue into 2020. Halliburton will keep achieving rational returns driven growth in the international markets. And finally, against this backdrop, Halliburton is focused on the right things. We're investing in the products and services that generate growth and returns, managing our costs and other operating levers and committed to generating strong free cash flow and industry-leading returns. And now, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Angie Sedita of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Angeline Sedita: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Angie. Welcome back.
Angeline Sedita: Thank you. Glad to be back. So, Jeff, maybe we could touch on your commentary on the worst in pricing is behind us. Is that -- give us a little color there. Does that imply that the pricing pressure is not completely gone? And then, also you touched on your levers to drive margins and of course, utilization and operational efficiency does drive margins in a big way. So can you talk about those levers and how much more you have to pull there?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Angie. The -- I’d say the worst is behind us. That doesn’t mean there's nothing, but it also means that when we look at the market and how it's shaping up, that does -- will there be some trickling effects, potentially I'm not going to give precision around our strategy there. But what I will tell you is that we’re saying no where the thresholds aren't met, which gives me confidence. And then aligning that with what we see around activity and tightening capacity, which all of that should progress as the year goes on and I view that as lending of support to pricing being behind us.
Angeline Sedita: Okay. And so does that -- with the tightening capacity and you talked about the attrition that’s ongoing, do you -- what’s your thoughts on pricing for the back half of the year or is that more of a 2020 event?
Jeff Miller: Yes, again, I'm not going to try to pick the date on where things are. I think broadly though our view is that we will see tightening capacity on the balance throughout the year. I described how hard equipment is working. Also, the capital discipline that our customers see, we see the same and so I think the reduction in CapEx or the actual -- the discipline around CapEx goes a long way to support balancing of the market. Now when does it balance? I think it's more balanced later in the year certainly than it is today. So I think that's all supported.
Angeline Sedita: Okay. And then as a -- unrelated comment, but a follow-up. The reorganization in the U.S land can you give us more color there? Is there a cost savings opportunity for the reorganization or is this more operational changes?
Jeff Miller: Look there's always cost associated with reorganization, but let me focus on making us more efficient and more nimble. So couple of years ago we took a fair amount of cost out, but most of that cost came in the form of an organization that would operate more efficiently and more quickly and it's really what we're doing here. This is not targeted at frontline by any means. What this is more around how do we brighten the lines and more quickly operate, make decisions and go to market. Now efficiency or lower cost is useful in any market in terms of driving performance, but that's not the intent.
Angeline Sedita: Right. Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over.
Jeff Miller: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
James West: Hey, good morning, guys.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, James.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, James.
James West: So, Jeff and Lance, on North America real quick, I think this is pretty easy to respond to, but one, are you stacking fleets now, if you can't get the appropriate return? And two, are you starting to see a push towards maybe a rebundling, meaning that as the operators have debundled previously when they were spending as much they could, now that their budgets are -- have shrunk in size, perhaps the rebundling, the reorganization, the better collaboration part of the business should start to unfold. I’m curious on both of those topics.
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, James. On the first topic, we did stack equipment in the first quarter and I'm not going to go any further than that, but as we look at the market and look at returns on equipment that causes to make those decisions and we will continue to manage our business around returns. The second question though was around rebundling and look I've always had a view that over time those things that make sense to come back together do. I think we are early days of that, but there is just such an elegance and efficiency around how things fit together. That doesn't mean we're not very competitive with each slice and I think we demonstrated that. But at some point once the pieces and parts have been examined you start to see, wow, it's a lot simpler to put those pieces and parts back together but to come, James, but I feel good about where we are in that process.
James West: Okay. Okay, got it. And then on the international side, Jeff it sounds like you’re a bit more bullish now than you were maybe a quarter ago. I guess, one, is that fair to say? And then, the second is kind of top line looks like it's going to be pretty strong this year. It has been strong, you’ve been outperforming. When do you think the bottom line or the incrementals start to outpace normalized incrementals?
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks. The -- look, I think what gives me more confidence is how broad-based this recovery looks today. And so we start to see not just a green shoot here and there, but I think as I described in my commentary nearly every region I talked about in terms of some form of growth we also see are broadening base of offshore sort of activity, not maybe activity and also the tendering activity that leads to more activity as we go into 2020. From a margin standpoint, I will focus those comments on D&E, obviously. We expect stronger decrementals as we -- incrementals, excuse me, stronger incremental to clarify that. What we saw in the first quarter, James, was I mean it really was a mix of different things both mobilizations that generally get done at midyear as we move to the year, the mix of services, there's a real pricing impact from the Middle East that we saw, I mean, a lot of the tender activity that happened in '18, it all started in earnest on January 1 of this year. So we saw some of that.
James West: Okay.
Jeff Miller: But what’s important, I think is, we expect strong incrementals in the Q2 for that business and clearly Q1 in my view is a bottom for D&E margins.
James West: Got it. Okay, great. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Lance.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Lance Loeffler: Thanks, James.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Judson Bailey: Thank you. Good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Judson.
Judson Bailey: Hey, Jeff, you started off your comments by saying what a difference 90 days makes and that’s probably appropriate. Could you maybe talk about how you’ve seen the year progress from -- I'm sticking to North America and how maybe customer tone or conversations have changed, and to the extent visibility over the next couple of quarters, or even the back half of the year has or has not improved as the macro environment has kind of stabilized here?
Jeff Miller: Well, I think the macro environment stabilizing is the key point. I mean in 90 days ago, we were coming off what was -- wasn't a clear path for commodity prices, obviously Q4 was pretty hard on everyone. So in the range of 90 days, commodity price set up. What we had thought would happen has happened in terms of customers going back to work. And as I said in my commentary, sort of each month was progressively building and that shapes our view. You know as we talk with customers, we look at the calendar, those things are all constructive as we look out to the next couple of quarters. More specifically around the second half of the year, a couple of ways we think about that, but I think importantly, is the production targets that are out there today, all of that require some level of completion activity to meet that. I also think that some part of the CapEx reduction gets captured in sort of other things, that’s -- whether it's sand or service price deflation and maybe lowering rig count a bit. And I think the last question really be around, what do the smaller operators do going into the back half of the year? And I think they may be the most opportunistic, it's most important to them also just with the smaller asset base investing in completions really matters a lot to the value, not just of the asset, but likely the company.
Judson Bailey: Okay. I appreciate the color there. And my follow-up is maybe for Lance. Your guidance on C&P revenues up mid single digits, my impression is that pricing is still on average a bit of a headwind as we head into the second quarter. Can you maybe give us your thoughts on how much the lag effect from the pricing weakness throughout 1Q impacts how C&P revenue growth looks in the second quarter? Just trying to balance what’s the volume and what’s -- what the headwind on pricing is?
Lance Loeffler: Yes, I think -- thanks, Jud. I think the -- it kind of goes back to what Jeff was saying maybe an earlier comment, I think you may see some of the trickling effect to continue from the pricing side, but it's more than offset by the level of activity that we see, which is what informs our guidance, so it's really volume related with some modest impact from pricing.
Judson Bailey: Okay. All right. I appreciate the color. I will turn it back.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open.
William Herbert: Thanks. Good morning.
Jeff Miller: Hi, Bill.
William Herbert: Good morning. Jeff, when you speak about the second half, is this -- and your frac calendar specifically, is this based upon specific visibility, which is populating the frac calendar or kind of a plausible expectation that completions needs to move higher even, I mean, for any number of reasons including meeting customer budgets, filling Permian pipes etcetera? So distinguish between optionality and actually tangible visibility that’s unfolding.
Jeff Miller: Yes, Bill, the -- we've got visibility in the calendar out a couple of quarters and so we've got a view of that and that's more specific. As we look further in the year, particularly the back half, I think there are some sign posts that we look for in terms of production targets met, not met, also around rig count with smaller operators, what that may look like. And I think that cadence also could be different in different basins, but I think we obviously have discussions with customers and I think there's -- it's quite a mixed bag in terms of outlook and how they plan to manage activity throughout the year, but we are asking those kind of questions certainly earlier than we have in the past and I feel like with our business development organization and ability to be very sharp around the edges in terms of where we’re and how we perform, I feel confident in at least Halliburton's outlook for the balance of the year.
William Herbert: Okay. Thank you. And then with regard to international margins, it seems like at least in the ordering the elements conspiring to weaker D&E margins in Q1 that the major issue with this was the mobilization expense associated with several different drilling projects, that’s a transient issue. So I’m curious as to when the mobilization -- well, first of all, how broad was the mobilization headwind in Q1 apart from the North Sea? Secondly, when does that abate? And thirdly, doesn't that represent a nice margin opportunity in the second half of the year?
Lance Loeffler: Yes, Bill. This is Lance. Look, I think there's opportunity and we do expect D&E margins to improve throughout the course of the year. I think we've been pretty vocal around that. While the mobilization sure will provide that uplift, it's not to discount the pricing pressure that we continue to see in the Middle East.
William Herbert: Okay.
Lance Loeffler: Right. I mean -- so, as we get through the first half of this year, we expect D&E margins to be markedly improved in the second half to sort of land at flat year-over-year margins in D&E.
William Herbert: Okay. So it's flat year-over-year margins for FY19 or second half versus second half?
Lance Loeffler: Flat year -- FY19.
William Herbert: Okay. Thank you very much, sir.
Lance Loeffler: Yes.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Scott Gruber: Yes, good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Scott.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Gruber: Jeff, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the U.S market is likely settling into one that’s less volatile, which would be good for you. It sounds like mainly a demand comment and obviously there's only so much you can control. Have you thought about ways of further reducing the volatility from your side, and how do you think about customer exposure? Does the growth of the majors presents an opportunity to tender into some contracts, which maybe stickier and longer term? Is there an ability to look at the E&Ps, given that they are settling into a spending cadence that maybe steadier? Is there an ability to go after some longer term deals with them? How do you think about overall reducing the volatility in the business?
Jeff Miller: Yes, without going into like specific things that we do, I mean, what you’re saying, obviously, we think about that. We’ve historically -- and look we do a lot of business with IOCs, we do a lot of business with all -- all of the customers in the marketplace along different of those 14 service lines that we have. But we’ve -- historically, we've optimized our frac fleet around what we view as the most efficient customers, we could drive the most margin. But I also think with the industrialization of shale sort of at scale, larger scale today, those types of things become more attractive and so we’ve good relationships, we’ve the ability to scale to those growth plans. And look and we plan -- plan to do so, but we're going to do it always with an eye to what are the best returns for our shareholders.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And then you mentioned 20% efficiency gains in frac over the last two years, how should we think about those gains in '19 and '20? Are you seeing efficiency improvement on par is starting to slow, just some color on that trend as well would be great.
Jeff Miller: Yes, I think we are seeing that. Through a degree we are reaching some sort of maximum velocity here just in terms of hours a day. If I would think back there have been some big sort of milestones in efficiency when Halliburton has been at the front edge of each of those. So the first was going from 12 to 24-hour a day operations, that was a big step. Next was more around zipper fracs as opposed to single well fracs and then multi-well pads as opposed to single well pads. All of those are sort of structural step changes. We’ve done a lot at the margin around being more efficient and our focus is taking capital off location not putting more capital on location. And so we do some things to drive our capital efficiency, but the big steps, I don’t necessarily see those today. What I really see over the next cycle or the next few years is more emphasis around what’s happening around the well bore as opposed to on surface and you hear a lot of discussion around that. But I say that to include everything from parent child, the spacing, the velocity, the all of these other things that we believe and I believe will have more impact on productivity and efficiency over the next three, five years.
Scott Gruber: If you had to put a number on the efficiency improvement this year, what would you peg it at?
Jeff Miller: I don't know. Less than it's been. I would just call it 5%, 10% maybe in that range.
Scott Gruber: Okay, appreciate it. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Sean Meakim: Thank you. Good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Sean.
Lance Loeffler: Sean.
Sean Meakim: So you mentioned, you've got a lot of different levers to drive cash flow depending on what the market gives you. I think a lot of your 2019 CapEx budget was committed prior to the reduction that you took end of the year. So, conceptually, if 2020 looks a lot like 2019, in other words, activity in North America is comparable, international's improving modestly, could your CapEx budget take another cut lower as some of the recent growth initiatives in Drilling & Production start to roll off?
Lance Loeffler: Yes, thanks Sean. Look, I think in terms of the sort of CapEx to revenue relationship that we sit at today, I believe it was like high 6% is lower than it's been on average over the last 10 years where we've averaged closer to 10%. I think, clearly this year, we've been pretty vocal about what buckets we're out spending as a part of that $1.6 billion of CapEx. I don't know that that -- to me, it feels like in and around 7% today, feels like a good number even for next year. Now the slices of that pie, right, as we go -- as we think about how we invest may change, but I think the rate of CapEx spend as we reinvest in the business feels pretty good.
Jeff Miller: Well, maybe just step in there too. I mean when we think about the outlook. I mean, we are focused on what I would call returns focused growth. And so if we think about where we are spending this year, we are continuing to invest in strategic initiatives and we are building out sort of our Sperry iCruise fleet and investing in international growth. So we are doing all of that today, sort of in and round where we and sort of the 7% -- 6%, 7% of revenues today. So it feels sustainable to me and I don't see this as a shift in our approach. I mean in this market, that level of spend is appropriate to generate returns.
Sean Meakim: Got it. Thank you for that feedback. And just one point of clarification, when you highlighted pricing pressure in the Middle East, is it -- were you considering this to be incremental pressure from customers, or is this really just a rolling through of contracts that were won last year?
Jeff Miller: Well, it's -- principally, what we see in this quarter is the rolling over or the establishment beginning of contracts at lower prices. It doesn't necessarily mean that it's abated. But it is certainly that's what we are seeing now, somewhere in the -- as we look ahead, we will work on how to optimize things and perform more profitably over time.
Sean Meakim: And so, would you say that -- would you characterize the magnitude of the decline due to the mobilization and that pricing basically in line with what you would've expected for the quarter?
Jeff Miller: Yes, that's -- no that's what we’ve generally thought we'd see and we also saw a number of things that I described in my comments with mobilization, that pricing, also weather in the North Sea was pretty tough this quarter more so than probably we'd have expected. So those sorts of things.
Sean Meakim: Very good. Okay, thank you.
Lance Loeffler: Thanks, Sean.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Jeff Miller: Chase, are you there?
Operator: Please check your mute button. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is now open.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning, everybody.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, I just had a follow-up question here. When you guys are talking about the overall spending activity -- spending levels for the U.S being down 6% to 10% and for international kind of be up high single digits, when we look at say Completion and Production and we look at Drilling and Evaluation, would it be safe to assume that in aggregate Completion and Production would be up, like you say completion activity be up, so I would imagine that overall C&P revenues to be up on a year-on-year basis, maybe in that high single-digit range, and think adversely on Drilling and Evaluation with the drilling activity being down in the U.S., that kind of offsetting growth internationally. So I just wanted to try to get a general sense, so C&P up kind of on a year-on-year revenue and D&E maybe kind of flattish. Is that kind of a safe way to think about it right now?
Lance Loeffler: The way that I would think about it, Kurt, is that -- I mean and we've mentioned this I think in some of our prepared remarks was that we expect our completions activity to be sort of flat year-over-year, right? Even though spend is down in North America, that takes the form of lower sand pricing or lower drilling expenditures versus the actual completions activity. And then as we think about D&E, particularly driven by the international markets, we see a broad recovery, pockets of pricing improvement, but also weighed down by pretty competitive Middle East today. So it's a balance of all of that.
Kurt Hallead: Got it. I appreciate that, Lance. And then, Jeff, maybe follow-up for you. I know you've had a very continuous focus on returns and that being the key mantra, one of the key mantras for the company. I was wondering if you could give us some perspectives on how you think about return thresholds and when you think about it in the context, is it -- when you think about our through cycle, is that a 3-year period, 5-year period, 10-year period, kind of some general insights on that dynamic would be helpful.
Jeff Miller: Look, when I think about returns, broadly, I think the -- I think about sustained growth over a period of time and I also believe that the value for growth at any cost is over and so when we will talk about returns focused growth, that’s the right kind of growth. And look, I feel great about Halliburton in this kind of paradigm. I mean, we've always been returns focused, clearly it starts with margins, so improving pricing and managing costs, we are always managing costs in that environment. And then I think disciplined investing, I think that maybe informs more of what you're asking, but we make capital scarce when we need to make capital scarce and we are also and might be investing in the right businesses. So if we think about lift and chemicals and where we've put our CapEx, we will do that very thoughtfully and certainly focused on returns.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe one follow-up just on the attrition comment, Jeff, you referenced earlier that 7.5 million horsepower will need to be rebuilt in '19 and you wouldn't think the spending level required to rebuild that equipment would happen. So in the context of attrition then, how much horsepower do you think could shake out of the market this year?
Lance Loeffler: Kurt, this is Lance. I think it's tough to call -- hard to really put a number on it, right? I mean, I think attrition has always been a tough one to try to define in the pressure pumping industry. But one that we know it's happening because we see what it's -- how it's working on our fleet, right and we talked about some of the stats that we had in our prepared remarks, you can't ignore it. And today we know that there's under-investment. We know that there's more pressure than ever on all of the fleet in North America around wear and tear and therefore the repair and maintenance costs associated with it and the burden that a lot of our space has had to shoulder it, I think, look, at the end of the day, there's going to be some that are just going to flat out, be retired.
Kurt Hallead: Got it. Right. That’s helpful. Thank you very much.
Lance Loeffler: Thanks, Kurt.
Jeff Miller: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Boyd of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Dan Boyd: Hey, thanks, guys.
Jeff Miller: Hi, Dan.
Dan Boyd: One of the follow-up on the international outlook, you put up a 11% growth in the first quarter, the guide for the second quarter sounds like about 10% first half growth year-on-year and presumably the mobilization costs you are calling out suggests continued growth in the back half. So just wondering what keeps you with a little bit more of a conservative high single-digit revenue number for the year?
Jeff Miller: Look, we want to be very realistic about what we see unfolding in the market. I think the -- a lot of the tender activity that we see today is probably not going to begin until 2020 and so we see activity building, but we are also going to be -- I’ve talked about returns focused growth. And that’s part of that discussion is making sure that we are investing and pursuing the right things. And look, we are really encouraged. In fact, I think what we will see is growth as I described in '19 and then certainly building into 2020 as sort of that broad based sort of offshore activity starts as opposed to being tendered and talked about. So encouraged, but again, we are going to manage our business.
Dan Boyd: Yes, just being conservative. Lance, I wanted to follow-up on Bill's question on the D&E margins. So, in order to keep them flat year-on-year it sounds like we need to exit the year in the fourth quarter low double digits. And so just wondering as you look past mobilization cost that you are incurring, is that a number that you sort of see without pricing and without big contract wins from here on out, but basically is how de-risked is that low double-digit margin?
Lance Loeffler: Well, look, I mean we are going to have to work towards it, no doubt. But I think the tailwind that you get as you begin to put revenues across the costs that we’ve been running and around the actions that we are taking in the North Sea and those mobilizations, I also think that we expect to start to see some benefit as we get more Sperry tools in the market. I think we told you that a third of the Sperry fleet will be iCruise by the end of the year, we are working hard to get those tools out, that’s part of the working capital build that you saw on the inventory side that I mentioned in my commentary around the international strategic investments and so those are the things that give me confidence that we can continue to build on what we need to get to those commitments.
Dan Boyd: All right. Thank you.
Lance Loeffler: Thanks, Dan.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi of Cowen. Your line is now open.
Marc Bianchi: Hi. Thank you. First question just back to the pricing discussion for North America, Jeff, you noted the 14 product service lines that Halliburton offers. Is there any distinction among those lines in terms of where pricing is bottoming, specifically everybody is focused on frac, but as you mentioned you are a big player in cementing, there's been some concern about cementing competition. Just curious if there's any distinction you could offer on those product lines?
Jeff Miller: Yes, I’m going to -- it's a very competitive space in North America so I’m not going to get any more detailed around pricing and where the other service lines are. Clearly, hydraulic fracturing is probably the biggest piece of sort of the North America landscape today and it probably is the most over supplied, so I will leave it at that.
Marc Bianchi: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Lance, in terms of the outlook for free cash flow growth for the year, big working capital consumption here in the first quarter, which is seasonal. Would you anticipate working capital for the year to be a neutral, a positive, or negative?
Lance Loeffler: Well, I think we are going to see a lot of benefit as we sort of work through the DSOs that we’ve built up in the first quarter of the year, I think we will continue to work down a lot of the inventory that we built up, I would suspect that -- the working capital does release cash some point throughout the year.
Marc Bianchi: Okay, super. Thanks so much.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Marc.
Lance Loeffler: Thanks, Marc.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thank you, Candice. Before we wrap up the call, I would just like to highlight a few points. First, I’m excited about the broad-based international recovery that we see unfolding and Halliburton is well positioned to take advantage of this growth. Second, I believe that demand for North America completions will be up modestly over the next few quarters and that capacity will tighten over the balance of the year. Finally, our focus on capital discipline, capacity tightening, and cost management will deliver leading returns and free cash flow in excess of last year. Look, I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Candice, please close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-22 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Abu Zeya. You may begin.
Abu Zeya: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2018 Conference Call. As a reminder, today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, Chairman, President and CEO; and Lance Loeffler, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter press release and can be found in the Investor Downloads section of our website. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period, in order to allow time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Abu, and good morning, everyone. Happy New Year. When we rang in 2019, we started a celebration of Halliburton's 100 Year Anniversary, reaching our centennial as a milestone few companies achieved and it's a testament to the hard work of our employees, who deliver on our core values of integrity, safety, creativity and reliability. From the humble beginnings of our founder, Erle P. Halliburton, our company has innovated, collaborated and executed through economic and industry cycles to become a global leader in oilfield services and technology. We look forward to our next century and continuing to deliver superior service to our customers and industry-leading returns to our shareholders. Now, I would like to give you some highlights for the full year and the fourth quarter of 2018. In this past year, we maintained our market share, generated industry-leading returns and outgrew our primary competitor. We accomplished this by effectively competing in key markets, by collaborating with our customers to engineer solutions that maximize their asset value and by continuing to make investments in strategic growth areas. Total company revenue grew 16% compared to 2017, and adjusted operating income increased 35%, finishing 2018 with total company revenue of just under $24 billion and adjusted operating income of $2.7 billion. In our Completion and Production division, we capitalized on the market recovery in North America, delivering total year revenue growth of 22% and operating income growth of 40% year-over-year. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered 6% revenue and 3% operating income improvement year-over-year, reflecting the beginning of a recovery in the international markets. We generated approximately $3.1 billion in operating cash flow and retired over $400 million in debt. Finally, we continued our focus on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which totaled over $1 billion in 2018. And now, a few points about the fourth quarter. We finished the quarter with total company revenue of $5.9 billion and operating income of $608 million, representing a sequential decrease of 4% and 15% respectively. Our Completion and Production division revenue declined 8% sequentially and operating income was down 19%, driven by lower activity in pricing for stimulation services in North America. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered a strong quarter, growing revenue 5% and operating income 2% sequentially. While our business in North America declined this quarter as the completions market softened, internationally, we delivered 7% revenue growth, which underscores the versatility and global reach of our business portfolio. The trajectory of this cycle has been far from smooth. The end of last year saw a large swing in commodity prices with both Brent and WTI retrenching over 40%, the levels not seen since June of 2017. The oil price has been gradually climbing since then and that's a welcome development. But increased price volatility creates near-term headwinds as we enter 2019. I'm convinced however, that the supply and demand fundamentals for multi-year industry growth are still intact. While short-term oil and gas demand changes are hard to call with precision, we know that the need for energy is consistently growing, and the oil and gas industry in general and the oil services in particular are instrumental to satisfying that need. As for supply, I believe that a maturing OPEC plus asset base, years of significant underinvestment in non-OPEC, non-U.S. production and natural decline curves in U.S. Shale will ensure demand for our services for years to come. Today, our industry is going through a transformation brought on by the Shale Revolution and the recent down-cycle. Because of that transformation, we're entering 2019 with a very different landscape, one that I think plays to Halliburton's strengths. First, North America is now the world's top oil producer and exerts considerable influence on commodity pricing. Second, the industry has cut a lot of cost out of the system and introduced significant efficiencies. And last, but certainly not least, 2018 was a year of transition to a more disciplined free cash flow approach by many customers in the North American E&P industry. As you know, many of our customers have shifted their strategy from production growth to operating within cash flow and generating returns. I believe this is good for the long-term prospects of our industry. This should make the industry investment cycle more rational and the commodity price volatility more range bound. Halliburton is well prepared for this market environment in order to deliver leading returns for our shareholders. As we have proven over the years and demonstrated in 2018, our technology, our people, our customer alignment and our financial discipline position us well to thrive in any market condition. In 2016, I led the implementation of structural cost initiatives that cut more than a $1 billion in cost out of our business. These included eliminating a layer of management, rationalizing our real estate infrastructure and streamlining our manufacturing footprint among other things. We remain vigilant, not to let these costs creep back in. Since then, we've also eliminated additional cost through our continuous improvement initiatives such as implementing product design changes to increase throughput and reduce cost in our manufactured products. We will continue to drive cost and capital efficiency throughout our company. Another strategic element that positions us for success today is our consistent focus on returns. I believe Halliburton's success is driven by a coherent asset base, meaning, assets that fit together and can earn appropriate returns. Greater asset velocity and superior job-site execution, all geared to deliver superior returns. This is exactly what we have done and what we plan to continue doing. For example, maintaining our own frac equipment manufacturing center allows us flexibility and lowers our total cost of equipment ownership. We do not invest in assets that burden our balance sheet to limit our capital flexibility without providing any significant differentiation, and they don't generate significant returns. That's why I am so excited about Halliburton, our strategy and our future performance. Turning to near-term operations in North America, as we expected the market for completion services experienced an activity decline during the fourth quarter as our customers responded the budget exhaustion and off-take capacity bottlenecks. This created excess equipment capacity in the market and had a detrimental effect on services pricing. Looking ahead to 2019 in North America, the drop in oil prices at the end of last year has impacted our customers' budgets for the year. As I talk to customers I hear three distinct approaches: First, the majors, They largely stay the course on their budget plan, and as many of them recently shifted their investment priorities from offshore and deepwater to shore recycle North America shale plays that is good news for Halliburton. Second, large independence, most of them already budgeted for $50 oil last year, so their spending should be mostly flat in 2019. And finally, small E&Ps who have limited access to capital, they're likely to cut budgets most aggressively if the commodity pricing doesn't improve, but they are also the most flexible on budget expansion if the market is supported later in the year. As our customer budgets reload in the first quarter, they are going back to work. And as a result, we expect modest improvement in completion activity levels. We anticipate, however, that the pressure on service pricing will continue in the first quarter. As the year unfolds, the catalysts for a broad completions activity rebound in North America are the following: first, a supportive commodity price environment; second, the DUC count in North America today is the highest it's ever been, although inventory wells exacerbated the short-term activity declines for completions in the last two quarters, they're essentially a future revenue opportunity. And finally, takeaway capacity constraints in the Permian Basin are expected to alleviate in the second half of the year that means many customers should go back to work during the second quarter to get production ready for the new pipelines. As the catalysts I just described materialize, they will have a direct impact on increasing customer urgency. This in turn should drive higher pricing in the second half of the year. As we traditionally play at the higher end of the price range based on our service quality, technological advantage and presence in all U.S. basins. I expect Halliburton to be the first benefit from price recovery. No matter of what as we have in the past, Halliburton will make more than anyone else out of every dollar spent in North America. Halliburton has also proven over the years that it's able to adjust as the market environment changes. We do not expect to rely on rising service pricing alone to earn returns. We intend to invest effectively and remain flexible in our cost structure, specifically we intend to reduce our 2019 capital spend compared to 2018. We are also prepared to stack equipment if it does not meet our returns' thresholds. We intend to dynamically respond to the changing market, maintain the right level of capital spending to support our business and continue to deliver strong cash flow and leading returns. Internationally, the recovery continues at a modest pace, this quarter we grew revenue from international operations 7%. On a full-year basis, our international business delivered top line growth for the first time since 2014, which confirms that the downturn inactivity is now behind us. As I discussed on the third quarter call, the international recovery is led by the national oil companies and focused on mature fields. NOCs generally do not alter their budgets in response to short-term oil price volatility and do not base their spending plans on the crude oil features strip. This makes me believe that the recovery in the international markets will continue. Over the course of 2019, activity should improve across all international regions although of a low base in some geographies like Asia Pacific and Africa. The existing contract backlog and the pipeline of projects are stronger coming into 2019. This should lead to healthy single-digit international growth for the whole year. In the first quarter, we expect international revenue to decline similar to last year due to normal seasonality and the elimination of year-end software and product sales. Last year, we won several major foothold contracts in different geographies. This work was priced very competitively and it will take us time to optimize contract performance and improved profitability. With the international recovery continuing and all regions pulling their way, we should start seeing equipment availability tighten in key markets. This should lead the better services pricing. With the activity pipeline improving internationally, we will selectively balance growth and returns in the international markets. Despite a slow start, 2019 will be another year where we continue to build the foundation for a longer term recovery. As North America oil production reaches a historic high and operators are focusing on returns over growth Halliburton is well prepared for this market environment. We've always believed and practice responsible capital stewardship, prioritizing capital efficiency, investing in the technologies that deliver differentiation in returns and generating strong cash flow. We have the right leadership team and bench strength to ensure the continued success of our global franchise. Just last week we announced the consistent with our succession management plan Mark Richard, who is currently Senior Vice President of the Northern U.S. Region has been promoted to succeed Jim Brown as President of the Western Hemisphere. I've worked alongside Mark for many years all over the world and I am excited for him to lead our Western Hemisphere business. I'm grateful to Jim for his more than 20 years of outstanding service to Halliburton. His leadership was instrumental in helping Halliburton execute and deliver industry-leading returns in North America and throughout the Western Hemisphere. Now, I would also like to welcome Lance Loeffler as our new CFO. You all know Lance well from his time as the Head of Investor Relations. He's worked closely with our management team and the investment community over the last few years, and I am confident that he will do a great job leading the company's finance organization. I will now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results. Then I will return to discuss how we are strategically positioned to differentiate ourselves in the current market and deliver returns for our shareholders. Lance?
Lance Loeffler: Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with the summary of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2018. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.9 billion and operating income was $608 million representing a sequential decrease of 4% and 15% respectively. In our Completion and Production division revenue was $3.8 billion, a decrease of 8%, while operating income was $496 million, a decrease of 19%. These declines were primarily driven by lower activity and pricing for stimulation services in North America, partially offset by stimulation activity increases in Argentina and year-end completion tool sales internationally. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 5%, while operating income was $185 million, an increase of 2%. These increases were primarily due to year-end software sales, increased fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico, and improved project management activity in Latin America. These improvements were partially offset by reduced activity for drilling services in the Western Hemisphere. In North America, revenue decrease by 11%, primarily driven by lower activity and pricing in stimulation services, partially offset by higher fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue grew 16%, driven primarily by year-end software and completion tool sales and higher stimulation activity across the region, coupled with improved activity across multiple product service lines in Mexico. Europe/Africa/CIS revenue remained relatively flat, primarily driven by seasonal declines in pipeline services across the region, coupled with decreased activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea. These results were partially offset by year-end completion tool sales in Ghana and Nigeria. Middle East/Asia revenue increased 8%, largely resulting from year-end completion tool sales in the Middle East, coupled with higher project management activity throughout the region. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $73 million, which is in line with our previous guidance. We expect corporate expense in the first quarter of 2019 to be approximately $65 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $137 million and we expect it to remain approximately the same for the first quarter of 2019. During the fourth quarter, we recognized the impact of a strategic change in the company's corporate structure, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $306 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 21%, excluding the tax benefit I just discussed. We estimate our 2019 full year and first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 24%, based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix. We generated approximately $850 million of cash from operations during the quarter, ending the year with a total cash balance of $2 billion. Capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $550 million, with our 2018 full year CapEx totaling approximately $2 billion. For 2019, we intend to reduce our capital expenditures by around 20% to $1.6 billion. This spend will be focused on key technologies and capabilities that deliver differentiation and drive returns, such as our new directional drilling platform and our production business expansion. We remain committed to generating strong cash flow by using cost levers, managing working capital and remaining flexible in our CapEx spend, focusing on strong return generating opportunities. And we will use excess cash prudently for strategic investments that meet our returns thresholds for reducing debt and for returning cash to our shareholders. Turning now to our near-term operational outlook, market dynamics continue to make forecasting a challenge. But let me provide you with some comments on how we believe the first quarter is shaping up. As is typical, our international results will be subject to weather-related seasonality and the roll-off of higher margin year-end software and product sales. North American results will be impacted by near-term headwinds that Jeff described earlier. We will continue to pull the levers that enable us to keep generating positive cash flow for our businesses. As such, in our Completion and Production division, we expect sequential revenue to decline mid- to high-single-digits, with margins decreasing 300 to 400 basis points. For our drilling and evaluation division, we anticipate sequential revenue will experience a decline in the mid- to high-single-digits, largely in line with prior year declines, with our margins declining by 100 to 150 basis points. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Lance. I'm excited about Halliburton, both this year and into the future. We have the right team, the right strategy and the right technology to meet our customers' evolving needs and deliver industry-leading returns. Our value proposition is working and I hear it from our customers every day. Unconventionals are unique and valuable asset and our customers have developed this asset to revolutionize the industry. We at Halliburton saw this development early and have been investing in and innovating ever since. As a result, we are the dominant service provider in this space. Our innovative technology to quality of our service offering, our customer alignment and our market presence in all the U.S. unconventional basins position us to continue helping our customers lead the shale revolution into the future. I discussed earlier that the international recovery is led by mature fields, I am equally excited about Halliburton's mature fields' technology portfolio and we intend to continue building our mature fields capabilities in 2019 and beyond. Technology plays a critical role in our business. It drives the progress in unconventional, revise mature fields around the world and makes offshore economic again. You know that we are the leaders in returns. What you may not realize is that Halliburton is a clear leader when it comes to technology development. In 2018, we've received nearly 900 patents, a 10% increase year-over-year. IFI Claims, a data-based provider of U.S. patent data, ranked Halliburton as the 39th largest grantee of U.S. patents last year. More importantly, we are the only oil and gas sector company in the Top 50 list. It is critical to understand how we prioritize technology investment. We spent money on developing or acquiring technologies that help our customers solve their asset challenges, drive better productivity and reliability, minimize downtime and improve asset velocity. This helps create meaningful differentiation and deliver returns on our technology investment. We are developing new completions technology that solidifies our leadership position in unconventionals, differentiates Halliburton from the rest of the market and delivers on the next level of efficiencies to both the customer and Halliburton. Over the last few years, technology is driven substantial, operational and surface efficiencies in North American shale. I believe the future of unconventional technology will be more heavily weighted towards enabling higher well productivity. As part of our intelligent frac strategy, in 2018, we introduced our Prodigi AB intelligent fracturing service that brings automation to hydraulic fracturing. Prodigi AB automates the breakdown process of a fracturing treatment, this helps achieve consistent cluster performance, increased production from our customers' assets and reduced wear and tear on our equipment. I'm pleased to report that by the end of 2018, we have successfully deployed Prodigi AB service across all U.S. shale basins. It's been used on more than 1,450 stages for 20 different customers across the country from the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas to the Bakken formation in North Dakota. Strong customer interest and willingness to pay a premium for the services support my point about the growing importance of technology that improves well productivity in unconventionals. Another technology that we have heavily invested in last year and we'll continue to spend capital on 2019 is our directional drilling offering. As the wells in the U.S. unconventional basins beat lateral length records. We are excited to introduce the next generation of rotary steerables to help our customers build better wells. We designed the new iCruise rotary steerable system from scratch using the latest material science and digital innovations with the focus on decreasing operating costs, improving reliability and reducing maintenance time and expense. As part of the system development, we've also delivered a host of innovated ancillary technologies such as smart diagnostic systems for the ease of repair and maintenance and a drilling advisory package for automated drilling. Since launching the tool in September of last year, we've already deployed it in all major U.S. shale basins. In 2019, we will focus on rolling out the iCruise system in the international markets. In fact, we already had test runs for several customers in the Middle East and deliver the longest lateral and longest well in Argentina's Vaca Muerta Shale in our first deployment. Today, we estimate that 40% of the wells around the world are either shut-in or producing below their potential due to well integrity issues, costing our customers, billions of dollars in lost production. Halliburton's cased hole wireline tools for well integrity assessment enable operators to accurately understand the conditions and treat the problems of mature wells. Our Electromagnetic Pipe Xaminer technology is the only service in the market that can quantify corrosion and metal loss through five strings of pipe. And our Acoustic Conformance Xaminer Service uses advanced hydrophone sensors and proprietary analysis software to pinpoint leaks that can occur in the well structure. These differentiating technologies help our customers optimize their asset performance and help Halliburton solidify our position in mature fields markets such as the Middle East, Asia, the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Artificial lift is the critical capability for both unconventionals and mature fields, and that is why Halliburton has expanded our artificial lift portfolio. Boosted by our acquisition of Summit ESP, our artificial lift business showed 43% revenue growth year-over-year and delivered outstanding margins. This is what I call a good return on a technology investment. In the fourth quarter, we started Summit's international expansion opening a testing and disassembly facility in the Middle East and making our first ESP deliveries in Latin America and the Middle East countries. We will continue investing in our production business in 2019, mainly in our artificial lift and specialty chemicals product lines. We are the execution company, we provide cutting-edge technology and exceptional service quality for our customers, and we believe these differentiators will result in industry-leading returns and positive cash flow for our shareholders. In summary, in 2019 we will continue to build the foundation for a longer-term recovery. In North America, we expect completions activity to moderately improve in the first quarter. I believe the catalyst for North America market improvement exists. And as they materialize, I believe Halliburton is best positioned to benefit from those improved market dynamics. The recovery will continue in the international markets. Halliburton has the project backlog and the line-of-sight tender pipeline to continue our international growth. Halliburton celebrates 100 Years of Service in 2019. I'd like to thank all of our current and past employees who made Halliburton what it is today. It's a big deal to be a century old. It's an even bigger deal to reach this monumental milestone and remain leaders in our field. As we enter the next century, I can assure you that we will remain focused on collaborating with our customers and engineering solutions to maximize their asset value and on delivering strong cash flow and industry-leading returns for our shareholders. And now, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
James West: Hey, good morning, guys.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, James.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, James.
James West: So, I guess, do you guys focus on returns?
Jeff Miller: Yes, we do.
James West: I think that was loud and clear. I guess the real question I have in my mind is, as an industry, the service industry return peaks have gotten lower, the valleys have gotten lower as well, where as an industry, if not Halliburton specifically, but as an industry, we're still negative, even though we're 3 years into a recovery. So there is a major problem across the industry and you're going up against people that don't have that same strategy. Now, I think there is a dichotomy I think internationally. I think your main competitor does have a returns-focused strategy. But I think in North America there is just too much capital that's not returns focused. Is that a fair statement? And how do you guys think about going up in a market like that? I mean, do you really need to start showing a lot - more discipline in stacking equipment?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, thanks, James, broad question, but an important one. And we manage our business. And that's one of the things that's informing our view of capital and capital returns, I talked about returns. Just don't discount the technology involved in our business, in what we do, which differentiates Halliburton. But I think that the - our focus on returns, so that means managing capital spend and also the willingness to stack equipment that is not making a return, it is critical. So that way we do that actually, we do make those returns. And it allows us to flex both down to the market where we see it. But also the differentiation is we take a very long view of this business. We're - we will differentiate. And we're all around the business of how to make more barrels with existing wells. So I think all of that plays together over time. But we're going to make returns along the way.
James West: Okay, okay. And then, how do you think about cash conversion, this cycle relative to, perhaps, other cycles? I mean, it seems like if we - we now have international go-ins, North America is a little bit up and down, but you seemed to invest. I think there's been enough investment in North America that it really should be only at sustaining levels now. So should we start to see cash conversion rates improve? And do you have a target there?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, I mean, rather than a target, I mean, our view is we're going to generate solid free cash flow in any market. And I think the market that we see shaping up is one where we can generate solid, quite a bit of free cash flow.
Lance Loeffler: Yeah, I would just add, James, that just to remind everybody, this is the first time ever I think that we generated over $1 billion of free cash flow in back to back years. And our expectation is that that will continue, right? That will be with the focus on managing cost, improving our working capital and being disciplined around our CapEx spend.
Jeff Miller: Yeah.
James West: Okay, all right. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Judson Bailey: Thank you. Good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning.
Lance Loeffler: Hey, Jud.
Judson Bailey: Hey. A question on your comment, Jeff, on completion activity being, I think you said, slightly higher or slightly improved. What kind of visibility do you have at this point for the first quarter in terms of your agreements with customers? Given the rig counts declining or seems to be declining, I'd be curious to get your thoughts on how you see the interplay between completions and maybe kind of drilling related services in the first quarter as well?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, Jud, look, I think those two are separating more and more in terms of what activity is being done. We've got pretty good visibility through the quarter and that's why I'm able to see why I do see modest increase in the amount of completion activity over that period of time. The drilling services may slow a bit. And I think that the pivot would be more to completions. But I also - we look ahead or beyond that, and we see those catalysts unfolding out into the future. But that's why I describe it as modestly up. When we look at our calendar, it looks modestly up through the first quarter, certainly relative to Q4. So we said it would be bottom in Q4 and we see an activity pick up here.
Judson Bailey: Okay, all right. I appreciate the color there. My next question is on D&E margins. It came in a bit lighter than what we thought for the fourth quarter especially when you factor in year-end product sales. And then, you're guiding down for those to drop again in the first quarter. Can you give us a little bit of color on what's going on within D&E that has margins I think coming in below what we would have thought? And then, how do we think about the rest of the year? Is there a catalyst to see those margins start to move a bit higher over the course of 2019?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, so, I mean, what you're seeing there reflected is the - we won a number of contracts around the world, particularly in D&E, that's where some of that growth comes from. And as I've described, sort of throughout all of 2018, a fairly tough pricing environment out there. And our view is that we optimize those contracts over time and we will. We'll get to work on them and we'll mobilize on to rigs. But there will be some work to do to get through that. Now, overall, our business improves as we work through the year as we progress. But there is just optimization that needs to happen around the world.
Judson Bailey: Okay, all right. Thank you. I'll turn it back.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open.
William Andrew Herbert: Good morning. Jeff and Lance, C&P incremental in Q4 were pretty benign at 35%, yet the guidance for Q1 implies 60%. Can you explain what's likely to unfold there? I assume it's mostly pricing. And then in a similar vein, your year-over-year incrementals for C&P in the low 20% 2018, how should we expect incremental margins for C&P to unfold beyond the trough of Q1?
Jeff Miller: Well, the Q1 [is - I think we] [ph] described it well, I mean, and as I described Q4, we saw activity down, but when we saw the pressure on the commodity price along with budget time that created quite a bit of price pressure that manifests itself through Q1. Now I also described what I see as the catalyst later in the year that I think create more customer urgency and from a price standpoint start to resolve that. And I would be surprised, if you didn't expect we can see those things unfolding feel pretty good about them as we work through the balance of the year. Now that said, I think, I was clear in terms of what our behavior would be if we don't see that, which is equipment that to the extent it is not making a return, it would get stacked.
William Andrew Herbert: Okay. And then Lance, when we think about the capital intensity of the business, on the one hand there's a commendable contraction in capital spending for 2019 down 20%. On our numbers, you're still coming at 6% to 7% of revenues. And I'm just - you were kind of oscillating between 7% and 9% last year, I think you bottomed over the past couple of years at 5%. In light of the competitive structure or in light of the more labored peak margin profile associated with the business, how should we think about fundamental capital intensity of the business on the full cycle basis?
Lance Loeffler: Well, I think, I'm focused on sort of CapEx for this year, I think, really the overweight spend in our CapEx going forward is clearly focused on Sperry business line as we continue to retool and re-kit with a new technology. I think as you might expect, some of the spend in our pressure pumping business would be more in line with DD&A. So I think, as we look out for the reminder of the year, we believe the range of $1.6 billion is the appropriate level of CapEx given the strategic investment that we're making in the level of activity that we expect at this point.
William Andrew Herbert: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Sean Meakim: Thanks. Hey, good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Sean.
Sean Meakim: So Jeff, you talked the difficulty of forecasting the cycles, so I'm just curious about you kind of where you put some of the bigger flex points within C&P for 2019, and you're going to trade some pricing exchange for volumes? What's your confidence level in terms of C&P top line being able to grow year-on-year and your confidence level in margins bottoming in the first quarter and the first half of the year?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. So we typically will see margins bottom the quarter after we see activity bottom, and that's not unusual that's kind of what we're seeing happened in Q1 right now. What I see on the - as I look through the balance of the year, if we think about the DUC count that's out there and that it needs to get converted into cash flow by customers. Pipes alleviate as we work through the year in the Permian Basin. No question about that. Supportive price environment, commodity price environment, which we do see shaping up at this point, and so that will be very helpful. And so that combination of things gives me a lot of confidence that as we work through the year, we should see better performance both from activity standpoint and also a customer urgency standpoint.
Sean Meakim: Okay. Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then so - just maybe explain a little bit more on the CapEx budget. Lance, could you maybe just - is there a range that we can talk about around that $1.6 billion? You give some detail on where you expect to see some of the growth areas, maybe within North America depending on how things shake out as you go through the year, could we quantify a bit of how that could flex from that $1.6 billion?
Lance Loeffler: Well, yeah, I mean, I hesitate, to - I mean, I think, what we described around 20% in my commentary, again we believe that based on our outlook right now for the year $1.6 billion is appropriate. But I think it's pretty obvious from the rest of our commentary that we are willing to flex down, if need be, if it doesn't play out the way that we think it will with the catalysts that Jeff described. So I think there is flexibility in the CapEx budget just as needed.
Sean Meakim: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Scott.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Gruber: I want to come back to the U.S. competition question a bit, just because there is a debate in the investment community as to the degree to which you're seeing rising competition, especially for the top-tier E&Ps and the major in the U.S. Just as U.S. E&Ps look, they can source more functions and some of the smaller service companies to expand geographically into more product lines? Do you hold this opinion? Do you - are you seeing rising competitions, especially amongst the top-tier E&Ps, and if so, how are you adjusting the strategy in response?
Jeff Miller: Well, this business is always competitive. So that's nothing new for us when we look at the marketplace. And when I think about our business that's why we focus very much so on our value proposition which delivers great service quality, obviously, we've got a fantastic business development organization. So we see things and we are engaging with our customers and solving their problems. And then finally, technology. In the technology piece, there is a chunk of that, that happens around surface efficiency, which we talk a lot about, and then more and more we talk about how we make more barrels out of each well. And clearly, we're differentiated along all of those continuums, and I think as we look that 2019, 2020 and beyond at this fantastic resource that shale, our contribution and what we do around not just modeling, but frac treatment and all that we can do to make more barrels will be progressively more important and differentiating.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And maybe if you can just touch on how you view the structural margins in North America, you've got a greater detail about the investments in directional, in lift and technology, which is great. Does that mean that overall you think about the structural margins in North America the same as you have in the past that around 20%?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think there is a lot of run in North America and there's a lot of earnings power in North America. It's a huge resource, and I'm not going to try to put a date on 20%, but what I will describe is, we sort of look at points in time, 2014, we are right around there; 2018 in 3Q, we've got around there - 2Q, and then as we - those conditions are there certainly to have better earnings power. I expect the things that we're doing now around technology and discipline and execution drive that. Then I also - I mean, I pivot back to the technology and the value of that resource and how many ways there are to make a lot of earnings. So if we're investing in drilling and we're investing in production today, those are important areas of growth, but that our R&D spend is very much focused on making more barrels in unconventionals.
Scott Gruber: Got it. I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
James Wicklund: Good morning, guys.
Jeff Miller: Good morning.
James Wicklund: Just so you know the background behind the call is coming up with an earnings estimate for Q1 in the low 20s, just so. A question about the international business, that higher project management activity throughout the Middle East, you talk about winning two contracts in Iraq, you're going to mobilize four to six rigs. Can you tell me a little bit - this is obviously becoming a bigger piece of everybody's business? Are you going to use Trinidad's rigs? Is this a fixed-price deal? Is there opportunity for upside? Can you tell us how these types of contracts are different from the typical HAL contracts or are they different from other international IDS projects?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. These aren't different from other IDS contracts. And in terms of which rigs we'll use, we'll use the rigs that are best positioned in most competitive to do the work. So but the contracts I'm describing are fairly consistent with lump sum turnkey type activity where obviously there are exceptions around risks and other things that we manage. But they are not widely different. They are an important part of our business and I'm described that's a muscle that's well developed for Halliburton. But at the same time, there are many points along the continuum between lump sum turnkey and discrete services, and we're participating in all of those today in a number of different markets.
James Wicklund: Okay. And my second question, if I could from a general point of view, it's been mentioned a little bit a couple of times this morning, but in the last 10 years, your returns have declined, in the last 10 years your market cap is right back where it was 10 years ago today. The industry as a whole doesn't seem to be creating any value. Your customers' market caps are up 3X. The service industry, you guys, which are most of it, you are flat to where you were 10 years ago. How does the business change going forward, so that you actually get to capture some of the value you create, rather than looking at your ROIC for last 10 years, see that value decline?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Well, Jim, I think we talked about some of that this morning, but it's free cash flow and…
James Wicklund: Yeah. But the company has been generating free cash flow up and down the cycle. Then I'm talking about return on invested capital as opposed to just cash flow generation. You guys talk about, you have your thresholds for returns, but basically you're saying you won't work anything below cash breakeven. Is the threshold for returns to you guys, cash flow breakeven?
Jeff Miller: No. And - I think the - when I look at - we step back and look at the kinds of investments that we're making and what we are able to do for clients to generate value, it generates value for us, I would say there's a lot more focus today on technology that generates value for us. When I talk about technology that's the kind of thing we're investing in, it either lowers our cost or makes us more productive and generates a better return. And…
James Wicklund: Is this the change over the strategy of the last 10 years?
Jeff Miller: No, it's not a change. But I think it is probably more prescriptive in terms of how we're doing that. And look, I think that the contribution of what we do is just that important to making this work and I think that we will generate better and better returns as we work forward.
James Wicklund: Okay, gentlemen. Thanks much. Good quarter.
Jeff Miller: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning, fellows.
Jeff Miller: Hey, Chase.
Chase Mulvehill: I guess first question - hey, so if we think about U.S. onshore completions business, just given U.S. shale, there seems to be more scaling up and scaling down of this business. What's your strategy to kind of manage the cost around that as there is a much more inherent kind of scaling costs for this business?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, when I think - I look to our business development organization to be way out in front of that in terms of our ability to respond, I think we do respond quickly to that. I think our response in Q4 was pretty quick to that. And as I look ahead, that alignment is critical. And I also think the types of investments that we make that allow us to be more flexible around scaling up and scaling down, and more variable around that make us even more effective at that.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, I mean, in the fourth quarter did you stack any frac fleets?
Jeff Miller: Look, if we look at Q4, we had a lot of equipment moving around in Q4, some sidelined for a variety of reasons. But, in fact, that is a response. We had customers that we wanted to finish out the work with for the year. And as we go into 2019, I think we've got that same ability. As I said, we're prepared to stack equipment when it doesn't meet economic thresholds.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. And then turning to the first quarter, when we think about North America, what kind of revenue decline do you expect or included kind of in your - or implied in your guidance? And then, you gave C&P margin decline of 300 to 400 bps. If you were to just kind of isolate North America overall, what kind of margin decline should we expect in North America?
Lance Loeffler: Yeah. I mean, I think, largely the guidance that we gave was a focus on the North America impact of the pricing that Jeff discussed, right, on the top-line and on the bottom-line in terms of margins.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. I mean, so when we think about North America, C&P was down mid- to high-single-digits on revenues and margins were down 300 to 400 bps. Is that a good proxy for kind of North America for 1Q?
Lance Loeffler: Yeah. And we've said that in the past, right. I mean, I think C&P has been a pretty good proxy for North America.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, just wanted to make sure. All right, thanks Lance. Thanks, Jeff.
Lance Loeffler: Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open.
David Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. Jeff, I was just - or Jeff or Lance, I was just kind of wondering if you could just talk a little bit about capital deployment internationally. You talked about the new IDC contract in Iraq and it's been a big business for you over there. I'm just kind of curious, you had mentioned that D&E margins are been held back a bit by mobilization cost. So how should we be thinking about kind of where you are in the overall cycle, as LSTK's kind of ramped up over the last few years? Are you in a place where it's really harvest mode or do you think there is going to be more of these contracts that keep coming in here that might kind of keep it in this place here for a little while? If you could just kind of help us understand how that capital deployment and how kind of that impacts D&E as you think about maybe the next kind of 12, 18 months please?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, and I think a lot of that startup around, a lot of contracts that were won in 2018 as I talked about, we were winning things at the bottom of the cycle. We know we can optimize those. But that's - it starts with price and optimization. Some of those were mobilizing too. We're winning - we won - we don't talk about all of them, but we won contracts in almost every geography of substantive size throughout the last year. What's probably more encouraging to me as I look around the marketplace and we see anecdotes, they're anecdotes today, but where we see acute tightness and we're able to move quite a bit on price. Now, that doesn't resolve over a quarter or a couple of quarters. But it is indicative of the kind of tightness that we would expect to see as a recovery unfolds and we start to see growth into 2019 and beyond.
David Anderson: So, Lance, now, that you have the purse strings and you're kind of looking at capital deployment internationally for projects like this, can you just help me understand is that capital deployment for kind of international, is that higher or lower than what has been in the last - say, 2018? Would you expect that to tail off here? Or is there just - and you're going to keep it open if the opportunities present themselves?
Lance Loeffler: Yeah, I mean, right now, the capital deployment going forward is really focused on Sperry, right?
David Anderson: Yeah.
Lance Loeffler: And it's a lot - that's D&E related as it relates to our international business and the technology overhaul that we're making there and making sure that once that technology is really invested in, in terms of the inventory of tools and the fleet that we have for our directional drilling business. So it's overweight with the focus on Sperry today.
David Anderson: And maybe one last quick question to Lance. Just on that CapEx budget, can you just give us a sense of kind of what maintenance is? I know it's a really difficult term, but any kind of sense as to kind of where of that $1.6 billion what you would consider to be maintenance?
Lance Loeffler: Yeah, I don't - we tend to stay away from the term maintenance, when it comes to our CapEx. It's really all growth related. But I would say that from a financial perspective, sort of in relation to our depreciation and amortization for the year, it's sort of - $1.6 billion is sort in the sustaining level, meaning it's matching what's rolling off.
David Anderson: It makes sense. Thank you very much, Lance. Jeff, thanks.
Lance Loeffler: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is now open.
Kurt Hallead: Good morning.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, Kurt.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead: Guys, hey, I just wanted to get a general sense from you, to the extent possible, right, say, if we're looking at a $50 WTI oil price environment, $60 Brent environment. And that really doesn't change a heck of a whole lot throughout the course of the year. When you think about the total company revenue dynamic for 2019, do you think you'd be able to squeak out revenue growth or given some of the first quarter challenges and the potential dynamics around the progression in North America for the rest of the year, do you think it's going to be too challenging to get revenue growth? What's your take - best take right now?
Jeff Miller: Look, it's $50; $50, $55 in my view is a supportive commodity price for activity, both internationally and in the U.S. And so, I'm encouraged as I see the catalysts come together throughout the year, I think that will have a solid upward direction on our entire business. And then, also at the same time, I expect we'll outperform whatever that is.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. So not going so far to suggest up or down, but outperform whatever happens to the marketplace? Okay, that's fair, that's fair commentary. And, Jeff, I was wondering, as you look at the international dynamics, right, you have some regions that you are going to grow off a very low base, and you have other areas where you talked about taking some big projects at lower margins. And how long do you think it takes for those larger projects to start to see that margin improvement? And do you think you'll be able to start to demonstrate that in the second half of 2019 or do you think it'll take all of 2019 and into 2020 before you before you get to that point?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, look, I think the - there is a lot of moving parts. At this point in time, I'm excited about those countries that are recovering and those geographies that are recovering. It will take some time to work through kind of the wall of new contracts that were picked up through 2018 and that will unfold in 2019. I'm not going to give you a date on when we think that works out. I just know that we're working that all the time and I'm really encouraged. And again, that's part of what drives the investment in drilling tools that I'm talking about and then also the opportunities that we see to drive better returns and better margins on some of these contracts won. But that does take time.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. And then last one to follow up, just use of cash, you obviously identified a reduction in capital expenditures. As you look at the prospect for share repurchase vis-à-vis M&A, which looks more attractive to you at this point?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, look, I mean, Kurt, our approach to excess cash deployment hasn't changed, right? We're focused on returning capital to shareholders. We also noted that we want to work, continue to reduce our debt levels. And then, obviously, if there are opportunities out there from an M&A perspective that meet our returns thresholds, we will do that. But it's all going to still be through the lens of returns. And so, we may be opportunistic when it comes to share buybacks that we're - we've got a track record at least over the course of last year where we were able to do all three and we expect to continue to do that moving forward.
Kurt Hallead: Got you. Hey, I appreciate the color. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
A - Jeff Miller: Yeah. Thank you, Nicole. So before I close out the call, I'd like to reemphasize a couple of points. First, I believe Halliburton is best positioned to take advantage of the North American catalysts that will drive completion activity and customer urgency as the year unfolds. Second, I'm confident of Halliburton's position internationally and how we will take advantage of the recovery that I see unfolding. And finally, we will continue our focus on capital discipline, delivering strong cash flows and maximizing returns for our shareholders. Look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Nicole, please close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only-mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator instructions] As a reminder this conference call may be recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference now over to Lance Loeffler. You may begin.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. As a reminder, today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton’s website for seven days. Joining me this morning are Jeff Miller, President and CEO and Chris Weber, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2018, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. After our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period, in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. As it played out, it was a challenging quarter for the services industry in North America. We didn’t see the typical growth we expect in pressure pumping activity in the third quarter. This negatively impacted pricing and the efficient use of our equipment as customers responded to budget limitations and off-take capacity bottlenecks. As said, I am pleased with our overall financial results for the third quarter. Our team optimized our performance in North America in the face of short term market challenges and the recovery of our international operations continue. Let me cover some of the key headlines. Total company revenue was $6.2 billion essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, while operating income was $716 million a 9% decrease compared to the second quarter of 2018, largely due to the softening North American market. We converted nearly a 110% of operating income into operating cash flow, generating approximately $780 million during the third quarter with over $2.3 billion generated on a year-to-date basis. We continue to deliver the highest returns in the industry this quarter. Now I’m pleased with our international business, which is showing signs of a steady recovery. Our international revenue increased 5% quarter-over-quarter with growth in every international region. As expected, North America revenue declined as a result of market softness, but we believe we still have the highest margins. Relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance, while our completions related activity remained relatively flat sequentially; we believe we outperformed the market based on available market data. This demonstrates the customer’s flight to quality and positions us well as the market dynamics improve. And finally, we continue our long term focus on delivering shareholder returns. During the third quarter, we returned over $350 million to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Despite the near term temporary challenges, which I will address in a minute the macro outlook for the oil and gas industry is the strongest it has been in four years. The combination of economic growth, affordable fuel prices and demand for petro chemicals sets the stage for continued positive trends. The focal point of the discussion during this current recovery has mostly been the supply side of the equation. The fact is we have more clarity today regarding the sources of supply and their limitation. Temporary issues affecting North America production, the spare capacity limitations in the Middle East and Russia and significant under investment in non-OPEC, non-U.S. supply are reflected in today’s strong commodity prices. Simply put, current commodity prices incentivize our global customer base to start unlocking more of their assets, and that’s a good thing for Halliburton. We see it in the increased number of final investment decisions announced by our customers and the projected rig count growth. Now turning to near term operations, in North America the market for completion services softened during the third quarter, impacting service company activity and pricing and Halliburton was not an exception. The combination off-take capacity constraints and our customers exhausting their budgets led to less demand for completion services than expected. Halliburton’s response was to retain our customers who demonstrate the best efficiency to manage cost, to move equipment to more active operators, to retain our people, to perform additional maintenance and to continue investing in technology. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, current feedback from our customers indicates that budget exhaustion and seasonal issues will predictably impact activity. We think operators will take extended breaks. Some even starting before thanksgiving. Therefore we expect customer activity levels to decrease in the last six weeks of the year. We will do what a rational business would do in this situation. We will work to keep our equipment utilized in the short term when it makes business sense to do so, and we will take steps to position ourselves for a better 2019. You know me and you know our management team. We understand the North America market better than anyone. We were the first to call out these challenges as we came out of the second quarter. I believe that these headwinds are temporary, and I’ll draw on the arsenal of measures available to me to manage through this brief dislocation in the North America market. Moving on from the fourth quarter, I’m excited about 2019. The catalysts are there for a strong activity rebound. These catalysts are, customer budget should reload with higher-priced decks and stronger hedge positions improving operator’s free cash flow and creating additional spending power. The rising DUC count will provide a substantial completions backlog ready to be worked down in 2019. Off-take capacity will expand. Our industry is adaptive and creative. This manifests itself yet again and the announced conversion of pipelines in the Permian basin and new processing capacity in the Marcellus. We believe that the market will get better in the first quarter of 2019 and sets up for continued momentum throughout the year. We believe that the fourth quarter of 2018 will be the bottom in North America land. I believe this, because I see it. I’m already seeing demand from our customers for 2019. They’re eager to get back to work. I hear it. I’m hearing this from our business development organization who are busy responding to inbound 2019 demand. I feel it. I’m feeling customer urgency come back as operators want reassurance. Our crews will be back out working for them when budgets reset and they restart their full completions programs. Increased activity leads to higher pricing. Once the catalysts I just described materialize, customer urgency will increase and that will help improve pricing. The quality of our technology and services allows us to play at the higher end of the price range, meaning we’re the first to benefit from price recovery. There are obviously a number of moving parts in North America and the slope of the ramp up in activity will be different in every basin. I continue to believe that all the temporary challenges we face are signs of a great resource, a resource that shifted the world supply and demand dynamics in the last five years. Our customers are resilient and creative. They are addressing these challenges head-on with the grit and determination we’ve come to expect from North America operators. So let me walk you around the various basins in the U.S. In the Northeast, our customers have already met their 2018 production targets. They slowed down activity and they’re now expanding their processing facilities. Natural gas prices have recently surpassed $3 per MCF and are forecasted to stay there throughout the winter. Pipelines are coming online and starting to move gas out of the Northeast and into more premium priced markets that will lower differentials and improve economics, allowing our customers in the Northeast to do more with their budgets next year. Similarly in the DJ basin, operators are waiting for additional pipeline capacity, primarily the DCP pipeline to help with differentials, while our DJ customers have significantly slowed down completions activity at the moment we believe that new pipelines arriving in 2019 will spur them into action again. The story of the ongoing effort to increase Permian off-take capacity has been well covered. Our customers there have responded differently to take away constraints, some still have firm take away capacity, and we continue completing wells for them. Others have options in other basins and have shifted focus elsewhere, and then there are those who don’t have take away capacity and don’t have options in other basins and they are deferring completions. In the Eagle Ford, we’re seeing operators who been highly efficient throughout the year, cutting back activity as a result of deflated budgets. In the Midcon and Rockies, operators are staying within their cash flow obligations for the year, however, our customers in all these basins are preparing to start 2019 afresh on a higher note. Halliburton works in every unconventional basin in the U.S. and were the best positioned to understand the market dynamics and take advantage of the expected activity improvement in 2019, wherever it may come first. In the meantime, we are watching the same external data points that you do. Commodity pricing will remain an important factor; with WTI around $70 the appetite to grow production will be much higher. The DUC count in North America is the highest it’s ever been, if our customer start working DUC down as early as mid-January, Halliburton will be a great beneficiary. Our customers are entering budgeting season. Their 2019 spending plans will greatly depend on where commodity prices are at the end of the year, what hedges are available for purchase, and when their current hedges roll-off, the combination of positive outcomes for all of the above would bode well for substantial increases in 2019 budgets. We know how to manage your business and will keep adjusting our cost structure to market conditions, but it does not make sense for us to dramatically reduce costs or infrastructure for what we see is a temporary slowdown in activity levels. We are using this time to improve the health of our fleet, to position our North America land business for future success and outperformance as the market improves. Internationally, I believe the markets are in the early stages of recovery. Modest improvement in activity continues, but competitive pressures remain. Nevertheless, I’m pleased with where our international business is today and think that Halliburton has a strong foundation for international growth in this cycle. We collaborate with our customers to improve their project economics and our profitability through advanced technology and increased operating efficiency. This international recovery as I see it has two distinct attributes; first, it starts with mature fields. In today’s environment, customers broadly favor shorter cycle returns and lower risk projects. That manifests itself in the form of development focused, production oriented strategies, both onshore and offshore. The active markets in the North Sea in the Middle East attested that. Second, this recovery will see national oil companies take the lead; many of them have government mandates to grow production and work hard to revitalize your mature asset base, develop unconventional resources for internal consumption and search for partners to fund offshore exploration. I believe both of these attributes play in Halliburton’s favor. We’re traditionally strong in completion and production technologies that are key to mature fields development. National oil companies look for a collaborative approach to tackling their various challenges, and collaboration is in our DNA. We go to work every day to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. Our international business is a more valuable asset to Halliburton shareholders today than it was even three years ago. We’ve had an international presence since 1926 and we currently operate in over 80 countries. During the last cycle, we made significant investments in our international footprint, including increasing our product service line footprint in various geographies, expanding our manufacturing capacity in Singapore and opening technology centers in Saudi Arabia, India and Brazil. The recovery in international markets is underway and we have the right footprint and the right technology portfolio to take advantage of it. We believe, we’ve demonstrated this by outgrowing our largest competitor internationally for six of the last eight quarters. Importantly, we are in the returns business, not the market share of business. We plan to balance both, to outgrow and make returns in the international market. The outlook for global commodity supply and demand is constructed. I’m confident that Halliburton has the right strategy, technology and services to compete and deliver leading returns in this market. We remain the leader in North America, which I believe is poised for a better 2019. Halliburton is also positioned better than it’s ever been for the international recovery. So now let me turn the call over to Chris to provide a few more details on our financial results. Then I’ll return to discuss how we are strategically positioned to differentiate ourselves in the market and deliver returns for our shareholders. Chris?
Chris Weber: Thanks Jeff. I’m going to start with a summary of our third quarter results compared to the second quarter of 2018. Total Company revenue for the quarter was $6.2 billion which was relatively flat. Total operating income for the quarter was $716 million, representing a 9% sequential decline. Moving to our division results. In our completion and production division, revenue was relatively flat, while operating income decreased 8%. Revenue was flat, primarily due to lower pricing in our U.S. pressure pumping business, offset by increased incompletion tool sales and well intervention services in the Eastern Hemisphere. Operating income was down primarily due to the lower pricing and higher maintenance expense in our U.S. pressure pumping business. As previously discussed, the higher maintenance expense was expected as we performed incremental maintenance in anticipation of 2019 activity. In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue was also relatively flat while operating income decreased 5%. These results were primarily due to drilling fluids activity declines in North America partially offset by increased drilling related services in Latin America. In North America, revenue decreased by 2%, primarily driven by lower pricing and stimulation services in the United States land sector and reduced drilling fluids activity in North America, partially offset by increased activity in our production chemicals and artificial lift product service lines in the United States land sector. Latin America revenue grew by 9% resulting primarily from increased demand for stimulation services in Mexico and drilling related services throughout the region, particularly in Argentina Brazil and Ecuador. These increases were partially offset by decrease software sales in Mexico. Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS revenue increased 4% primarily driven by higher pipeline services across the region, coupled with increased completion tool sales in the North Sea. In the Middle East Asia region, revenue increased 4% largely resulting from increased completion tool sales and well intervention services throughout the region, partially offset by lower pricing and stimulation services in the Middle East. In the third quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $78 million up $7 million compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the implementation of cost savings projects. For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate and other expense to be approximately $75 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $140 million and we expect it to remain approximately the same in the fourth quarter. We reported $42 million of other expense for the quarter, up from $19 million in the second quarter. The increase is primarily due to foreign exchange losses that were driven by the strong U.S. dollar and the devaluation of certain emerging market currencies some of which we have limited ability to hedge. For the fourth quarter, we think $40 million is a good estimate for other expense. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 19%, which was lower than anticipated due to discrete tax benefits. Looking ahead, we expect our fourth quarter effective tax rate to range between 20% and 21%. Turning to cash flow, we ended the quarter with a total cash balance of $2.1 billion. We generated approximately $780 million of cash from operations during this quarter. Capital expenditures during the quarter were approximately $410 million, and our full-year 2018 CapEx guidance remains unchanged at approximately $2 billion. Before I turn to the fourth quarter guidance, I want to take a minute to discuss capital allocation, which we view like everything else at Halliburton through our returns focused wind. We had three uses for our excess cash. Return of cash to shareholders, debt retirement and growth. Regarding return of cash to shareholders, we pay a solid dividend and we initiated share repurchases during the quarter buying back $200 million in shares. Going forward, we will continue to consider share repurchases when we have excess cash. Regarding debt retirement, this quarter, we repaid our $400 million note that matured in August. With this payment complete, we have now paid that $2 billion in debt over the last two years, which is a great accomplishment. We have previously discussed repaying our $500 million 2021 maturity; however, we have decided not to do that this year. As we evaluate current potential opportunities, including share repurchases, we believe that there are more attractive opportunities for using this cash. Regarding growth, we will continue to pursue value accretive growth opportunities, be it both on M&A or stepped out organic growth. Investing in the business increases the value of our company and Halliburton has a great track record of making smart investment decisions that generate industry leading returns, and we plan to continue to do so. Now, turning to the guidance for the fourth quarter. As is typical, a combination of weather, holidays, budget constraints and year-end sales make forecasting a challenge, but this is how we currently see it playing out. In our C&P division, we expect the results to be down in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the North America land market, where we expect the activity level of our pressure pumping customers to decrease by a low double-digit percentage in the fourth quarter. This will mean lower utilization for our equipment, less efficient operations and continued pricing pressure. Also, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we will continue performing incremental maintenance in the fourth quarter to prepare for a busy 2019. In our D&E division, we expect our results to improve slightly primarily due to typical year-end sales. As a result, we expect earnings per share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.40. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks Chris. As I see it, this cycle is shaping up to be a marathon, not a sprint. The key to successfully running a marathon as I can tell you from personal experience is being physically and mentally prepared for the long run. Now I’d like to highlight what Halliburton is doing today to be ready for this sustained cycle. I talked to you a lot about technology. Let me remind you why it’s important. We expand our technology portfolio to gain scale, grow market share, create competitive advantage and win both internationally and in North America. We are deliberately investing in technologies and capabilities that we believe will do three things; drive growth, create meaningful differentiation and deliver returns. In our drilling and evaluation division, we recently launched the new iCruise Rotary Steerable System. It’s the most intelligent drilling tool in the market. It combines smart technology with advanced electronics, sophisticated algorithms, multiple sensors and high-speed processors with some of the highest mechanical specifications on the market. Tools already been deployed for customers and three U.S. unconventional basins as well as internationally. We are excited about the iCruise System, not only because it delivers fast drilling, accurate well placement and reliable repeatable performance for our customers, but also because the simple, modular design of this tool and its self diagnostics capabilities mean that it’s maintenance takes a lot less time, which increases asset velocity, reduces repair and maintenance costs and improves returns for Halliburton. Our EarthStar, ultra-deep resistivity service, another innovation from the Sperry Drilling product line played a large part in helping us win several important contracts in the North Sea. This new logging haul drilling center delivers the unique ability to map reservoir and fluid boundaries more than 200 feet from the well board, over twice the depth of current industry offerings. It gives operators a much clearer view of the reservoir helping to precisely geosteer [ph] their wells and to achieve higher production, lowering cost per BOE. Adoption of this new well placement technology is occurring not only in the North Sea and other offshore markets, but even in North American unconventional. We plan to build on this momentum to grow our business in these markets to drive differentiation and deliver returns for Halliburton. As I’ve said, Halliburton makes technology investments to deliver growth, differentiation and returns. So what does this look like in our completions business? Halliburton is the market leader in completions and hydraulic fracturing and we continue to innovate. Our technology and operations teams are constantly working on new opportunities for advancement, for creating meaningful differentiation from our competitors and for saving cost for us and our customers. For the last several years, we’ve made significant investments in our surface efficiency strategy. We’ve introduced technologies, like ExpressKinect, Wellhead Connection unit, ExpressSand system and IntelliScan equipment monitoring software. They have helped us achieve a 50% reduction in rig up, rig down time cut cycle time between stages in half and reduced our maintenance cost per horsepower hour. These investments drive returns for Halliburton. They allow us to charge a premium for our equipment. They improve our asset velocity and they have reduced the required capital on the well site. While the industry has been focused on implementing surface efficiencies to squeeze costs out of the system, I believe that the next step forward in efficiency will come from higher wealth productivity achieved through better subsurface understanding. In our quest to provide the lowest cost per barrel of oil equivalent, refocusing on increasing the number of barrels for our customers through subsurface insight. To this end, in addition to service efficiency, we’re investing in the technology to help our customers improve well productivity. This is our intelligent frac strategy. I’m pleased to see the growing customer interest and willingness to pay a premium for better well placement and better fracturing efficiency, which leads to more barrels and lower cost. During the third quarter, we launched our Prodigi AB intelligent fracturing service, and by the end of 2018 it will be deployed in every unconventional basin in the U.S. If the inaugural element of our Intelligent frac strategy and the first commercial solution on the Prodigi platform. When we hydraulically fracture a well, we force fluid and sand into the rock thousands of feet below the surface. Prodigi AB Service utilizes algorithms to fine-tune the pump rate based on reservoir response without human intervention. It allows for real-time adjustments to treating pressure during initial pumping conditions which leads to consistently higher breakdown efficiency and improves proppant placement. Prodigi AB has been deployed on over 500 stages across multiple customers and basins. In a recent trial, Prodigi AB demonstrated our ability to achieve consistent breakdown across the entire stage which leads to better well productivity for our customers. Additionally, Prodigi AB lowers treating pressure by nearly 10% and cuts pumping times by 10 to 15 minutes per stage. This means reduced wear and tear on our equipment and lower maintenance costs. Well productivity is not only dependent on job execution, but it's also greatly affected by job design. Our Prodigi AB assist with consistent job execution, the newest addition to the Halliburton Intelligent frac portfolio, GOHFER, Fracture Modeling Software ensures that we have the right designs to execute. We’ve recently acquired this industry-leading fracture simulator which is used globally for conventional and unconventional well completion designs, analysis and optimization. This acquisition enhances our frac business and I'm excited to welcome GOHFER into the Halliburton family. And as I said earlier, this will be a mature fields led recovery. Halliburton is investing in our portfolio of production capabilities that will allow us to grow share, differentiation and returns in this market. Our production group grew revenues 36% year-over-yea as we’ve made significant strides expanding our position in artificial lift and production chemicals, all key capabilities in the mature fields domain. It's been over a year since we bought Summit. In that time, we’ve expanded our market share in the U.S. and started delivering this product offering into the international markets. We've experienced exceptional growth. And I can tell you there are still significant growth opportunities ahead. We’re bringing the full power of the Halliburton global footprint to bear and taking our ESP offering to the Middle East and Latin America. The customer feedback is positive and we intend to grow this business into a global market leader. As you may remember, in the second quarter we entered into the reactive chemistry space through the acquisition of Athlon Solutions. We expect Athlon will enhance growth and profitability in our Multi-Chem product service line and across our chemistry portfolio. This acquisition is the first step in developing our reactive chemistry capability in North America and complements our ongoing efforts to manufacture chemicals in the international markets. I'm excited about these additional capabilities and look forward to their future growth and contribution. Athlon and Summit are two great examples of how we use targeted M&A to enhance our portfolio and drive returns. Halliburton maximizes returns our technology investment by being the most effective in the market at lowering our customers cost per BOE. This is what gives us significant market share in North America and internationally, and this is why Halliburton is well-positioned to compete win and deliver industry-leading returns in both of these markets. In summary, we know the North American market and will manage through the temporary challenges. The catalysts for 2019 rebound are clear and Halliburton is best positioned to take advantage of what we expect to be a sustained up-cycle  We believe that the international markets are in the early stages of recovery. Despite competitive pressures Halliburton is well-positioned internationally to win and make returns. And finally, we are a returns-focused company. Everything my team and I do is aimed at continuously delivering industry-leading returns. Now, let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
James West: Hey, good morning guys.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, James.
James West: Jeff, I was wondering if you could expand a bit on your – on the catalysts you see for 2019, being a much better year for the industry both North America and International. I mean, we agree with that, but I’m curious as – since you’re closer, obviously, to your customers than perhaps we are. Could you maybe talk through some of those major key catalysts that you see driving significant growth next year?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, James. Yes. The outlook or the catalysts are clearer than probably they’ve ever been which is a bit of a rarity in our business, but as we now look at the budget resets we know that has to happen, we know that will happen, our customers have done a good job of working sort of within their budget this year. But as we look at 2019 and a higher commodity price that really sets up well for adding to budgets in the next year. And at the same time if we look at DUCs, DUCs are at historical high. Those are the kind of things that get worked off. We get back to the higher global oil price, that has an impact on hedging as hedges roll off, new hedges get put on. So again, all of these are things that we can see and certainly leaves me to a view that Q1 is better than Q4, and that momentum would then build on the back of all of those catalysts. As far as the timing of those catalysts, look like they happen next year. I’m not going to try to call it timing, but confidence it they happen. The -- internationally, similarly the underspend that’s happened for the last three years pretty extraordinary, and I think that just the requirement to reinvest in a lot of these places is driving what I see as the recovery.
James West: Got you. And maybe just to follow up on international side, Jeff, it seems to me like the portfolio strategy that was put in place by you and your largest competitor, perhaps starting year, year and a half ago to make sure you’re setup in the right market for the right contracts. It should be mostly over at this point and it should be time to get going on pricing. Is that a fair statement?
Chris Weber: Well, it stays fairly competitive internationally. And so I can point to anecdotes where we are able to get pricing, but the bigger projects remain very competitive. When I look at those kind of projects certainly the – we have a bias for returns. But I think we’ve demonstrated, we can grow in that market, not growing that market, but at the same time I think the competitive pressure is probably more than we think. Those contracts will get worked off, will get work through and optimized, but I do think that will take a little bit of time.
James West: Okay. Got it. Thanks Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Scott Gruber: Yes. Good morning. So, Jeff, I just want to clarify the earnings bottom comment, is that just a comment on North America or is that a global comment? Basically, I’m curious if North American recovery in 1Q can more than offset the seasonal weakness abroad that we think we’ll se in 1Q?
Chris Weber: Yes. Well, it’s a – that’s not a global comment. We look at North America; I'm pretty excited about what we see. The Q4 looks like a bottom. The recovery -- rather than call it the timing and pace of it, we’ve talked about the catalysts that happened next year. When I think about the technology that we’re investing in around surface efficiency and maybe more importantly subsurface efficiency, I think all of those things frame up where I’m pretty excited about 2019. Internationally, there’ll still be some seasonality that we always see in international, Q1 to Q2 to Q3 which has sort of a fairly predictable cycle. So internationally excited about the recovery, it continues. But it's a little bit different than the North America that we think about.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And then just -- an unrelated follow-up on the new Rotary system, the iCruise system, do you think that system closes the technology gap with Schlumberger and Baker?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, I'm super excited about this technology. I mean it's doing what I thought it would do. Its performance is terrific and it’s equally important its performance is terrific in my view, at a lower cost and that makes returns for us both of those do. And so, I think as I said in my comments its in three markets; North America, we’ve got it international today. It’s doing what I thought it was capable of doing. And really we’re -- like everything it’s a journey and so there’ll be more to come.
Scott Gruber: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Sean Meakim: Thanks. Hey, good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Sean.
Sean Meakim: So it seems to me the key for investors here is going to be getting confidence that 4Q is in fact the bottom and I think many folks will remember the challenges the industry had to start last – this most recent year. So how do you characterize the interplay between C&P volumes and pricing in 3Q? And we had topline flat margin off 140 bps. And just what’s the read-through to 2019 to give you confidence that frac pricing gets back on track?
Chris Weber: I’ll take that sort of a third quarter piece. I mean when you look at within our C&P division specific to the North America land, really pricing is the biggest driver activity roughly flat quarter-on-quarter. There’s really, you know when we think about activity coming down is really in relation to the expectation what we would typically see in the third quarter, but on a sequential walk, roughly flat, so really pricing story in the third quarter. Moving into the fourth quarter, it’s going to be more activity, as we see pullback from our customers, budget exhaustion and your seasonality taking effect.
Jeff Miller: Yes. So, when we look ahead I’ve described the catalyst. I’ve been less prescriptive on the timing of those catalysts but they start to happen in 2019. And I think that – I’ve talked to customers. They’re eager to get to work. Obviously there’s seasonality that happens in the fourth quarter and into Q1, but we get on the road to a better market as those things that do happen, happen. So for example, by that I mean budgets they do reset, companies get back to work. And I think generally there's bias to do more next year not less particularly with where the price is. So without being as prescriptive those things start to happen in 2019.
Sean Meakim: Okay. Fair enough. Chris, maybe could we get little bit more granularity on the decision-making around the debt repayment, maybe kind of stepping back from that as opposed to some other choices for allocating cash as we go into 2019. Just curious kind of how you should set investor expectation towards the long-term goals on dept-to-cap versus the other priorities that you are obviously also focused on?
Chris Weber: We’re focused on a strong balance sheet. I mean this doesn’t change our perspective on our target debt metrics. We’ve talked debt-to-EBITDA being underneath two and half times which definitely, line of sight on that, debt-to-cap being in the mid 30s. And that will take time to work towards. Maybe we have a strong balance sheet today. I think it continues to get stronger over time. But when we look at just opportunities for using that cash right now and we take into account the progress that we've made repaying debt $2 billion over the last two years, 400 million of that in the third quarter. And again in relation to opportunities that we see now including share repurchases we just feel like there's better uses for that cash right now.
Sean Meakim: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open.
Bill Herbert: Good morning. Jeff, can you discuss with regard to Q1, which basins do you think will be strongest earliest and which ones will lag relative to Q4, in terms of activity?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Bill, all behave differently I suppose. I would say, probably Eagle Ford response probably more quickly with budget resets. I think probably we’d expect some response in the Northern Region as we -- or say Northern Region, DJ, Eagle Ford, -- DJ and sort of Bakken as things reset up there. But the -- it will happen in as it happens. Certainly the weather can be in that mix, but I actually -- getting back to work broadly I think is certainly the most impactful piece of that and customers really want to. I think that budget discipline, our capital discipline that we saw this year to a degree, the reaction in Q2 is sort of had a carry on effect and so I feel like as things reset there’ll be lot more appetite to do more. Bill.
Bill Herbert: Okay. So, I just want to -- I’m trying to get at, with regard to your discussions that you're having with customers who are Permian focused, even -- I’m trying to understand, are they also telling you that Q1 given the budget reload, strong commodity prices, better hedging opportunities, they’re going to be off to the races too? Or do you expect them to lag a little bit waiting for incremental pipeline capacity as that unfolds over the course of 2019?
Jeff Miller: Yes. The trouble, Bill, every customer is different and each has their own strategy and response to what out there. So I’m careful when I make blanket statements. So, if you just step back and look at the kind of consolidation that’s happen in that market, that certainly doesn't happen to do less, the kind of activity that we see out there. So the timing and pace, so I think will be an individual decision by different customers, but clearly they’ll be a reloading that goes into next year.
Bill Herbert: Okay. That's fair. And then Chris with regard your guidance, I’m sorry, I think, I understood C&P down double digits for reasons you expressed. I think I heard you say D&E up in the fourth quarter. Would margins for D&E would be flat to up in Q4 or how would you expect that to unfold?
Chris Weber: I think we’ll see slight improvement in both revenue and margins in D&E. Like I said, largely driven by year-end product sales or I should say software sales from Landmark which should be difficult.
Bill Herbert: Okay. Which is the last one -- which leads into that last one from me. So that implies kind of the C&P margin, I think at the low-end of about 12.5%. Would you expect that to be the trough margin for C&P?
Chris Weber: Right now, Jeff, talked about the North America land reaching a bottom in the fourth quarter. Don't want call bottom on anything else at this point, but we do think from an activity perspective North America land in the fourth quarter feels like a bottom.
Bill Herbert: Okay.
Jeff Miller: I mean the cyclicality will occur internationally, Bill, there are other things in there that – there’s Latin America, there is North Sea. We do quite a bit of C&P work in a lot of different markets. So, just don't want to call that right now.
Bill Herbert: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Jud Bailey: Thanks. Good morning. Jeff, question for you as we sit back and kind of look at the industry, one question I think lot of people are asking is, as we go to year end there’s a lot of excess frac capacity sitting on the fence, efficiency gained across the industry have been very solid. As things start to improve in 2019 how do we think about the industry regaining in pricing leverage and frac? Do you believe if we will get any -- I’d appreciate any comments on how you think about pricing leverage kind of swinging back on any kind of activity increase in 2019?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. I mean there's a couple of things. It starts with customer urgency. And what we're seeing with budgets right now is sort of the opposite of customer urgency. When we see that creep back in around higher commodity prices more activity to do, I expect we'll see opportunities for pricing leverage swing back to service providers. We saw that early this year. We saw a quite a bit at the year before. I don’t expect it to be different. I think the equipment today, I’ve said it many times, it is working harder than it’s ever worked and that means equipment is wearing out at a pace that it's not as abundant as one might think. I think the second piece though that over time is – and I don’t want to talk about technology of over time being around the subsurface, which I spent time talking about Prodigi which is beginning piece of that and also go for this quarter, but many other things we’re doing around modeling that really ask how do we make more barrels or how do customers make more barrels per well and I think that's going to be very important over time.
Jud Bailey: Okay. All right and thank you. And my follow-up is in the past you’ve referenced the ability to get to 20% margins. Do you feel like with the way the industry is kind of situated today, and not putting a timeframe on it, but is that still an expectation or a goal for Halliburton over the intermediate term? I guess, is that achievable in your mind given the technology initiatives, efficiency initiatives and kind of how you see pricing playing out?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. When I step back and look at it, right now, we're on and I think the best business in the big service market today. And under the right conditions can we get there? Yes. I believe we can. But that doesn't change what we're doing today in terms of addressing the market, making the best returns in the market and truly investing in this market for the long-term.
Jud Bailey: Okay. Thanks. I’ll turn it back.
Jeff Miller: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Jim Wicklund: Good morning, guys. What we really like is the exact day and the hours if you can provide it, of the inflection when things are going to start getting better? And whether it would be a weekday or weekend? Jud questions were most critical I think because investors aren’t sure where margins bottom or will be when activity starts to recover or at least pricing starts to recover? And you already noted that the pricing is being more impactful right now than utilization, and you talked a little bit about efficiency. One thing we're hearing is that you guys and your peers are getting so efficient in terms of fracking that maybe we don't need as many frac spreads out there as we did before. And we’ve seen this happen with drilling rigs as they went through a significant period of efficiency. Is the same thing going to happen to pressure pumping over the next couple of years guys?
Jeff Miller: Well, I don't think so. I mean I think there's a lot of demand for what we do, and I think the equipment gets worked harder and it will -- the technology of better pumps and those kind of things will prevail over time from an efficiency standpoint, but I think the bigger piece of efficiency that I was talking about earlier is around productivity and the investment and that I think will drive a lot more demand for what we’re doing. I mean, the core of the core is only – is a finite resource. So I think as we look out what we’re doing around our intelligent frac strategy and what customers will have to do in order to be successful, will continue to consume more, not less, I guess, for lack of a better word.
Jim Wicklund: How much more and you talk some about your technologies that you’re developing, and all that’s exceptionally impressive, for an old simulation engineer anyway. How much more efficiency, however you want to manage -- describe it, how much more efficiency can we wring out and hydraulically fracturing unconventional wells. Where can we go if we've taken Permian wells from 257 IPs to 2000, where does this all in? Where do we get to the point where we’re so much steady state and how efficient are we at that point?
Jeff Miller: Well, I think the efficiency lever is progressively harder to pull in terms of amount of time. I mean, literally more sand, bigger stages, takes longer to pump. I mean, you start to reach, generally, limits around what faster looks like. And there's a lot of debate at the minutia level around A versus B but realistically, overall, how much more does that move? When I think about making better wells over time, I think that will be more and more significant, just because the complexity of how this gets done will increase. And, typically, it involves working equipment harder, even if not necessarily faster, which I think keeps us all very busy over a much longer period of time, over the long-term. And so for that, I mean, I just continue to see the demand certainly for what we do and I think that technology component will become progressively more important.
Jim Wicklund: And my follow-up, if I could. We listened to one company the other day talk about the benefits of being vertically integrated in sand. You’re noticeably not. Can you tell us what the benefit of not being vertically integrated in sand is?
Jeff Miller: Well, yes, I look at everything through a returns lens. And back up. When we allocate capital and we think about what we do, I look first at what do we do that’s unique? What can we do that is unique and drive differentiation? And with respect to sand, we do more around moving it and pumping it and that’s really our uniqueness. So you see us spend our capital on either equipment or technology around that equipment that don't add much technically to a grain of sand. And we’ve got great partners that we work with and I think we have always found that there's plenty of sand in the marketplace and the best thing to do is make the best returns. And I don’t see that for us with sand.
Jim Wicklund: Okay. Thanks guys and good guide down for Q4. Reset the bar. Good job. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open.
David Anderson: Hey, good morning, Jeff. I just want to talk a little international here for a change of pace. You had some really nice growth you showed here sequentially. I was just wondering if you could talk about which parts of your international business you think have the most potential for 2019. And do you think a double-digit international revenue growth for the full year is achievable?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, I’m real excited about our drilling activity. I talked about technology but what we’re doing with Sperry and how that has an impact on all of our business, I think that's important. I think I’m also excited about C&P internationally. We’ve got a pretty big book of that out to go do and I think there’s a lot of demand in markets to address, either unconventional or tight formations, in an effort to make more production. But I also think, if we look out at 2019, it’s a bit of a mixed bag in the sense that there are going to be markets like Asia Pacific and Europe, Africa, Eurasia that, in my view, recover more so, pretty strongly, on a percentage basis, just given where they started. But there are other parts of the market, Middle East, that have been fairly resilient throughout the downturn. And so that, while fantastic business and market, may mute to a degree that absolute amount of growth. But to be seen, if I look at next year, we're looking on the plan now. But are we high single digits? Are we double digits? That feels like about the range.
David Anderson: Then you had mentioned spare capacity issues internationally. You just referred to your C&P side, your drilling side. Is that where you see the tightness? Are you suggesting that there’s an improving pricing outlook out there? Can you just kind of touch on that a little bit for a few minutes?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I think the drilling equipment is probably the tightest thing in the marketplace today. And as it gets -- as we work into 2019; that will drive, I suspect, a better view of pricing, better pricing. Again, on anecdotally, we have discussions every day with customers. But at the same time, big projects continue to be competitive. So that’s why that’s a bit of a mixed bag. I think we've got the ability to optimize those things as we work through 2019 and I suspect it's a better year, certainly, than last year as it recovers..
David Anderson: And then just last thing. On the offshore side, do you think offshore contributes much to next year's number or is that more of a 2020 event, based on your conversations with your IOC customers?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean, IOC -- well, let's back up. Take offshore as far as deep water versus shelf, then deep water, it'll be -- I think it plays a role. It certainly does. North Sea, we've talked about North Sea and as that sort of gains momentum into next year. But generally speaking, it's going be mature fields. So if I slice it by mature fields versus offshore or onshore, it feels, certainly, like that’s a better part of the business. And, again, from Halliburton’s standpoint, it lines up perfectly well with what we do, in terms of completions and I talked about what we’re doing around wireline and case fill wireline and some of those kind of things. So I think it shapes up really well for us.
David Anderson: Thanks, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is now open.
Kurt Hallead: Hey and good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. So, I just want to follow on the recent line of questioning here in the context of international growing high single digit, low double digit, without really kind of holding to you until you get your budgets done. Do you think North America, on a year-on-year basis, will outpace international?
Jeff Miller: Well, they are such different size and sort of pace, it’s hard to say. I mean, I think the international will grow for different reasons, partly being more NOC-led, and that’s really around mandates by governments to produce more. North America is such a dynamic sort of capital market driven growth that if we see -- where we see oil price shape up I think North America has the ability to move faster than we’ve seen that in the past. And I try to describe the catalyst that are out there that would allow that to happen, so I think that let’s get through the planning but from a growth standpoint, it feels stronger in North America but to be seen.
Kurt Hallead: Thanks, Jeff. And from a maintenance standpoint is this the intensity, the maintenance do you think been greater, is it going to be greater during this kind of pause than what’s it’s been over the last couple of years and do you think that could ultimately do additional industry wide fleet attrition?
Jeff Miller: Well I would think for Halliburton and I think we’ll do more maintenance as we go through the Q4 as I described just to be ready for 2019. I think broadly, the size of stages, pressure and rate all conspire to work the equipment harder than it’s ever worked. And so I think we put a lot of effort into managing maintenance how we manage maintenance, the technology of maintenance. We got a tech group that looks at maintenance and so I think all of those things are important to our performance in North America more specifically around doing maintenance, we know it’s important and plan to do it as we get through Q4.
Kurt Hallead: Right. And then if maybe finish up. What’s your take, Jeff on electric frac fleets in the potential adoption by the market place?
Jeff Miller: Look, I’m going to say it’s too early to call only – we’re looking at all types of technology all of the time, but what underpins all of that is returns and uptake and sustainability. And so that’s again I think it’s earlier to call out one, but we are certainly looking at it among other things.
Kurt Hallead: All right. Always appreciate the color. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: You bet. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions. I would like to hand the call over to Jeff Miller for any closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks Nicole. Look before we close out the call, just like to make a couple of final points. First, I believe Q4 represents the bottom of the temporary North America dislocation. We can see the NAM recovery catalyst and expect Halliburton to benefit as they manifest. Second, I’m excited about the early stage international recovery and believe Halliburton is better positioned than ever for success. And then finally, our strategy and focus on capital allocation positions Halliburton to continue delivering industry leading returns. So I look forward to talking with you next quarter and Nicole, please close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. That does conclude today’s program. You all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2018 Q2  (2018-07-23 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Lance Loeffler - IR Jeff Miller - President and CEO Chris Weber - CFO
Analysts: James West - Evercore ISI Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo Angie Sedita - UBS Sean Meakim - JP Morgan Bill Herbert - Simmons Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse David Anderson - Barclays Scott Gruber - Citigroup Kurt Hallead - RBC Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded. I’d now like to turn the conference call over to Lance Loeffler. Please go ahead.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2018 conference call. As a reminder, today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton’s website for seven days. Joining me this morning are Jeff Miller, President and CEO; and Chris Weber, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and others Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. And unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of the first quarter charges related to Venezuela. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release and can be found in the Investor Downloads section of our website. Finally, after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period, in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. This was an excellent quarter. Thanks to all the Halliburton employees for their hard work and dedication to superior service quality. Activity improved in all geographic markets in the second quarter. And I’m happy with how Halliburton continues to outperform our major competitors. I believe that our strategy to collaborate in engineered solutions to maximize asset value for our customers will continue to generate industry-leading returns for the remainder of 2018 and beyond. Now, before we dive into the details, here are a few highlights for the quarter. Total Company revenue was $6.1 billion, representing a 7% increase; and operating income was $789 million, a 27% increase, compared to the first quarter of 2018. Our Completion & Production division grew operating income by 34% sequentially, primarily driven by the strength of U.S. land. North America had a strong performance this quarter, once again outgrowing the rig count; and U.S. land margins are closing in on the 2014 peak. During the quarter, we launched our new Sperry ICRUISE rotary steerable in U.S. land, and it looks like a big success. We acquired Athlon Solutions, providing expertise and a manufacturing footprint to develop our reactive chemistry capabilities. And finally, we generated approximately $1 billion in operating cash flow. This is a great step towards generating solid cash flow for the year. And no doubt about it, this was an excellent quarter. We executed on our plan and delivered strong results. Our overall strategy continues to work and we plan to stay the course. We remain focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance, and providing industry-leading shareholder returns. As I said in the highlights, U.S. land achieved margins in the second quarter that are closing in on our peak margins from 2014. I want to talk about what that means. Despite pricing levels that had yet to fully rebound from the recent down cycle, we’re achieving outstanding margins. Halliburton executes. We are resilient, adaptive and creative. We’ve been able to outperform by keeping our core competencies strong and delivering superior service quality. I’m very proud of our North America business. We’re the leading service provider. This is the fastest growing and most dynamic energy market in the world. We have the best people, equipment and technology as well as the closest customer relationships in the North America market. We’ve grown 47% year-over-year in North America, while the rig count has increased 16%, a significant outperformance. At the same time, we believe we’ve achieved close to double the margin of most of our competitors. I believe the strong fundamentals and supportive commodity prices will encourage continued growth in North America. Fast-growing markets present tremendous opportunities and often temporary challenges. Halliburton is best positioned to take advantage of these opportunities and execute in the face of any challenge. Let’s talk about the challenges of cost inflation, basin dynamics, and pricing, and how we’re addressing it. With the expected activity in the second half of this year, we are mindful of the impact of cost inflation from trucking and increased maintenance expense. The use of trucking for sand, water and crude oil is generating intense demand for trucks and truck drivers, thus creating cost inflation. We manage trucking costs through the use of containerized sand and integrated logistics helping offset inflation. Our equipment has never worked harder than it’s working today. Increased pumping time and sand loading continues to cause more wear and tear. Halliburton focuses on reliability and service quality, which requires well-maintained equipment that works as many hours as possible. We have kept our average crew size well below the market average by doing continued maintenance, and that comes with a cost. In this environment of record sand usage, we believe as a result of our predictive diagnostic tools, we are more efficient than our competitors in maintaining our fleet. Now, with respect to basin dynamics. There is much talk in the industry about off-take capacity. But during the last few weeks, I visited with customers in the Permian and they don’t look like a group that’s backing down. I can see it in their eyes. They feel good about where they are and how they are positioned for the long run. Don’t underestimate this group. They are competitive, will figure out how to deal with constraints and will adapt. Don’t get me wrong. I am not naïve to the math around that off-take issue. But as we’ve seen so far, our customers will not all react in the same manner. There are customers that have moved their focus from one basin to another, and we’re there pursuing that work. Other customers plan to reduce activity over the short term or adding fewer rigs than expected, and we will find new work to replace them. Let me put the off-take constraint in the context of what I’ve seen in the past. Tightness is an indicator of a great resource, and what is occurring in the Permian today is not new. We managed similar challenges in the Williston in the last cycle and in the DJ Basin today. The DJ suffered constraints on gas takeaway all year but our customers have managed their businesses and remained productive as have we. This work may not be as efficient as it could have been, but we’ve taken action to maximize our revenue and control our cost. The constraints in this basin should begin to alleviate in early 2019 as additional off-take capacity comes on line. The same will be true in the Permian, which is best suited to handle this type of challenge, and will do so as quickly as possible. In the interim, we are going to keep equipment working, control our costs and outperform our competitors. The Marcellus is beginning to see some softening in activity as our customers hit their production targets earlier than planned. In some ways, we are a victim of our own success as we develop longer laterals with better production. As a result, we expect this area to have temporary softness in the back half of 2018, but it’s poised to regain activity as the calendar turns to 2019 and additional pipeline capacity is available. We will manage through the year-end and be ready for the increased activity next year. I expect that these temporary efficiency drags will create headwinds for additional upward pricing in the third quarter. Our competitors’ new and uncontracted equipment is also creating pricing pressure in some areas. We will continue our efforts to optimize pricing and utilization, pursue continued technology implementation and control cost to maintain our industry-leading returns. For example, the continued implementation of our ExpressKinect system, containerized sand, and new Sperry tools will help improve our efficiency and returns. Look, I could take some actions that would allow us to achieve our margin goals today. But I believe that would sacrifice our market position and impair our long-term value. We do not manage the business to achieve short-term expectations. We manage the business around long-term strategic goals. We will stay focused on our strategy, maintain our market share, and not sacrifice either to achieve our margin goals in the near term. We’ve built market share during the downturn on our strong belief in the long-term potential of the North America market. We are returns focused Company. To deliver returns, market share and scale matter. We intent to maintain this expanded market position as our scale delivers outsized operating income, cash flow and returns. I’m excited about the growth and activity we expect next year, and we are best positioned to maximize our growth and returns. We have the largest revenue base, among the highest margins in North America, the best customers, the best technology, and the best people. Why risk our position when we are working towards a stronger market in 2019? In the meantime, we plan to protect our market share, maximize our cash flow, and achieve the best margins in the industry. Shifting to technology. Part of what keeps Halliburton outperforming is our implementation of improved technology. This quarter, we introduced our ICRUISE rotary steerable technology in the U.S. land market, and our customer feedback has been extremely positive. We deployed ICRUISE in two major U.S. basins, proving its drilling speeds and complex geosteering capabilities. The wells were successfully drilled while remaining entirely in the payzone of the reservoir. We will continue to deploy this technology globally over the coming months. And I want to thank our design, manufacturing and operations teams for their hard work and dedication to this rollout. We’ve been clear about our desire to grow our artificial lift and production chemicals capabilities to better position us for the future. Now, this month marks a year since we brought Summit. In that time, we’d expanded our market share and started delivering this product offering into the international markets. We’d experienced exceptional growth, growing at 3 times the rate of the U.S. land rig count, while executing our integration plan, we remain optimistic about the opportunities ahead. The customer feedback is positive and we are well-positioned to grow this business into a global market leader. In the second quarter, we entered the reactive chemistry space through the acquisition of Athlon Solutions. Athlon is a manufacturer of chemicals for the upstream oil and gas industry, and is a leading provider of specialty water and process treatment chemicals. This acquisition provides expertise in reactive chemistries and facilities. We expect Athlon will enhance growth and profitability in our Multi-Chem product service line and across our chemistry portfolio. This acquisition is the first step in developing our reactive chemistry capability in North America and complements our ongoing efforts to manufacture chemicals in international markets. We had a plan to grow artificial lift in production chemicals, and we’re executing our plan. However, this will have a short-term impact on our C&P margins. I want to thank all of the employees that are making this happen and welcome the new Athlon employees to our team. Without our employees’ hard work and dedication, these acquisitions would not be successful. I’m excited about these added capabilities and look forward to their future growth and contribution. Now, turning to the international markets. I believe that the international markets will continue to steadily improve over the coming quarters. Halliburton doesn’t always get the credit it should for our international business, but it is strong. And we consistently execute to manage the changing market dynamics. I’m excited about where we are in the international markets. Halliburton is better positioned than ever, and we are ready to make the most of it. We’re in every market. We made the investment last cycle. We have the technology. We grew the breadth and depth of our portfolio. As an example, in the last cycle, we only competed in part of the wireline market. Today, we offer technology that goes head-to-head with the competition, in every geography. We’ve strengthened relationships. We’re collaborating with customers to maximize their asset value. Our value proposition is resonating. We are present, and we we’re winning. You must be present to win in the international business. There is no doubt, the pricing environment and the international markets has been challenging. We saw a large number of tenders in the first half of the year. These tenders were competitively bid as service companies buy for market share, and our customers sought to capture pricing at the bottom of the cycle. In many countries, large tenders set a baseline for activity for the industry, which will cover basic in-country overhead and should allow any incremental activity to be bid with healthier pricing. As we look ahead, we see emerging conditions that should enable leading-edge pricing to improve next year. Growth in geographies like the North Sea and volume increases in the Middle East should create an inflection point, at least to improve overall pricing in 2019. How much improvement and how quickly it comes, will depend in large part upon commodity prices and equipment absorption. Two great examples of our success in the international markets are recent contract wins in unconventionals in Saudi Arabia and offshore Norway. Both of these locations present technical challenges and we’re meeting those channels. We’re bringing our industry-leading technology to help develop unconventional plays in the Kingdom. I believe this work represents the largest unconventional completion contract ever awarded in the Middle East. This is a great opportunity to provide a customized application of Halliburton’s technology, logistics management, and operational excellence to maximize asset value and deliver optimal recovery. This opportunity places Halliburton at the forefront for expansion in unconventional activity in the Middle East. In Norway, we improved our market share through collaborating in engineering solutions with our customers. The North Sea is in the midst of recovery, and additional activity is starting to reduce excess capacity. The contract wins we’ve seen in this region are due to our technology development, service quality, and willingness to collaborate with our customers. This is a market where our improved wireline and Sperry technology have been most effective. Acceptance of our new technology is positive. And we plan to build on this activity to improve price and efficiency, thus improving margins. I recently returned from a trip to Latin America. This region is continuing to fight to reduced activity levels and pricing pressure. Our employees remain focused on winning work and delivering superior service quality. Our bright spot in the region is Argentina. I am pleased with the progress we’re making in unconventionals in that country. Basin infrastructure is slowly improving and we have a strong customer base that is collaborating, investing and doing what is required to make the market work. Working with our customers, we see the opportunities that will help us reach the efficiencies necessary to make unconventional plays even more successful. We believe in our customers in this region and will implement our industry-leading technology to reduce cost per barrel of oil equivalent. Moving to our long-term view of the international markets. We will continue to increase our business in the industry’s highest growth markets, including mature fields and unconventional resources, and optimize our Company’s growth and returns. We expect an improvement in our international operations in 2019 as new contracts start up, leading-edge pricing improves, and new technologies are introduced. Looking to the third quarter, I expect our earnings will be similar to what we delivered in the second quarter due to the temporary issues facing North America. That’s a great outcome. I like where we are and it will serve as an excellent bridge to a strong 2019. The temporary challenges will soon abate. And I believe global supply and demand dynamics will support continued industry growth, which I expect will accelerate in 2019. Halliburton is best positioned to outperform in the short term and to capitalize on a period of prolonged future growth for the industry. Now, I will turn the call over to Chris for a financial update.
Chris Weber: Thanks, Jeff. I will start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2018. Total Company revenue for the quarter was $6.1 billion and operating income was $789 million, representing increases of 7% and 27%, respectively. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in U.S. land. Looking at our division results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue increased by 9% while operating income increased 34%, and operating margin increased by nearly 300 basis points. These results were primarily driven by increased pressure pumping and artificial lift activity in the United States land sector as well as increased pressure pumping services in Europe, Africa and CIS. These increases were partially offset by reduced completion tool sales in Europe, Africa and CIS, and reduced pressure pumping services in the Middle East. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased by 3% while operating income increased 2% and operating margin was roughly flat. These results were primarily due to increased drilling activity in United States land sector, as well as increased drilling services and project management activity in the Middle East and India. These increases were partially offset by reduced drilling fluid activity in the Gulf of Mexico. In North America, revenue increased by 9%. This improvement was led by increased activity throughout the United States land sector within the majority of Halliburton’s product service lines, primarily pressure pumping, as well as higher drilling and artificial lift activity. Partially offsetting these increases were lower pressure pumping activity in Canada and reduced drilling fluid activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America Revenue grew by 5%, resulting primarily from increases in software sales and project management activity in Mexico as well as stimulation activity in Argentina. Turning to Europe, Africa and CIS, revenue was slightly improved. These results were primarily driven by higher pressure pumping and pipeline services throughout the region, offset by lower completion tool sales, primarily in the North Sea and Angola along with reduced drilling activity in Azerbaijan. In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue increased 6%. This increase was largely the result of increased drilling services, project management activity, and completion tool sales in the Middle East as well as increased project management activity in India. In the second quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $71 million, in line with our guidance. Next quarter, we expect to see a slight increase to about $75 million, primarily due to the implementation of cost saving projects. Net interest expense was $137 million, which is in line with our previous guidance. We expect to continue around this run-rate in the third quarter. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 20%, which was lower than anticipated due to discrete tax benefits. Looking ahead, we expect our third quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. Turning to cash flow. We ended the quarter with a total cash position of $2.5 billion, inclusive of marketable securities. Cash from operations during the quarter was approximately $1 billion, driven by higher business activity and working capital improvement. Capital expenditures were $565 million and our full year 2018 CapEx remained unchanged. Going forward, we expect to generate strong free cash flow and still plan to retire the $400 million note that matures in August. In addition, in the second half of this year, we are targeting to both retire our $500 million 2021 debt maturity as well as initiate share repurchases under our existing authorized program. Let me turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Chris. To summarize, despite the temporary challenges affecting North America, I believe we are in the beginning of a prolonged cycle to continue to expand our revenues and improve our margins. The international markets continue to see pricing pressure, but we are seeing signs that pricing is stabilizing. We’re experiencing the positive impact of incremental activity on margins. We believe that the second half of 2018 will be better for our international markets. And contract wins in key segments are providing us the foundation to expand international margins in 2019. We will generate strong free cash flow through the balance of the year and look forward to reducing debt levels and initiating buybacks. Halliburton is the best positioned for this market. Our value proposition resonates with our customers. And we will continue to maximize their asset value while providing industry-leading returns for our shareholders. Now, let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. 
James West: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, James.
James West: So, Jeff, I want to make sure I get your guidance correct here, specifically with regards to North America. So, clearly, it’s temporary, but we’re going to see some weakness. The Marcellus, I think, is one that’s a little bit new to at least myself. We obviously understand the issues in the Permian. But, I guess, are you suggesting that revenue comes down in the second half and there’s a commensurate impact on the margin profile in North America, in the second half? And then at some point, in -- obviously, in ‘19, we’re going to see again a short squeeze and a pick-up in activity pretty significant. But, is that kind of the profile you’re thinking about over the next several quarters?
Jeff Miller: Yes, James. Look, when I talk about flat earnings that does not mean flat revenues. We see revenues up in North America and quite frankly internationally, and expect to outgrow the rig count in both. From an earnings perspective, let me say this, internationally, we face the same issues as our competitors. In North America, quite frankly, no one knows it better than we do. And I’ve already mentioned a lot of those challenges in my remarks. So, the bottom line is, I think that headwinds and the tailwinds are about the same, but very positive in terms of outlook as we look at 2019.
James West: Okay. Fair enough. And then, on the international side, there is a little bit of pricing starting to at least tighten as we go into 2019. Are you already having these discussions with the customer base at this point, and do you see your utilization of equipment, basically getting to that trigger point where you have to raise pricing in order to justify CapEx investments before year-end?
Jeff Miller: Well, James, clearly having those discussions with clients, we are seeing the ramp up in activity internationally, and seeing some tightness in certain product lines. For example, we bumped up CapEx last quarter at Sperry and anticipate rolling out technology, and what we see is that runway. But, we’re coming off of a tough bottom here. So discussions don’t necessarily mean price increases, certainly not immediate.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Jud Bailey: Jeff, I wanted to narrow that down on the North America margin kind of topic. You cited several things that’ll probably impact things in the back half of the year. Pricing in some areas little bit of risk, new mix chemical is now in there, uncertainty in a couple of basins. How should we think about -- you can frame it as C&P or just North America margins, do margins flat to down in the third quarter or up? And then, how do we think about them in the back half of the year? And what are going to be the main moving pieces that will impact profitability in North America over the next couple of quarters in your mind?
Jeff Miller: Well, I think, look, maybe I’ll just take a minute on the second half or this quarter and look ahead. I mean this was a fantastic quarter and delivered the highest revenue, highest margins and best returns. But, I did talk about customer dislocation in the northeast to a degree as they’ve met their production goals, and at least likely moderation or perception of moderation in the Permian Basin. But, I do know with certainty that 2019 is going to be humming. I mean, we’re looking at demand that’s already on the books. And I know this business. And so, whenever equipment moves around or we see any kind of slack in the system at all, I know the maintenance goes up, cost. And I’ve told our people to take advantage of that and spend more but be ready for 2019, which realistically translates into about $0.04 incremental impact on Q3. And that additional $0.04 is already baked into the guidance that I gave you. So, I don’t know, if that gives you a little more color. I mean, this is great market and great business.
Jud Bailey: Okay. So, should -- I mean to just to circle back on that, do we think margins can hold firm or they deteriorate a little bit due to all -- some of these issues we’re talking about in the third quarter?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think in the third quarter, because of the things I’ve talked about, there may be some softening, but we’re going to be still at or well above kind of where the rest of market is.
Jud Bailey: Okay. I appreciate that. And then, maybe if you could talk a little bit more detail perhaps about Athlon, the acquisition during the quarter, you touched on in your prepared comments. Maybe you could give us a little bit more detail on how you view that business and how it’s going to impact North America business moving forward?
Jeff Miller: Look, really excited about the Athlon acquisition. And it’s part of a strategy that we’ve had in place to grow our chemicals business. It’s a small acquisition, but it’s the kind of thing that I’d like to do because it gives us all of the platform to grow at organically from here, and it complements some things we’re doing internationally. Over time, it’s going to deliver terrific returns. We are early in that cycle having just closed. But, the approach that we take on these kind of acquisitions, really works. This is an example where we buy a plant that’s sort of moderately utilized. We’ve got internal utilization that will actually ramp it up to a high rate of efficiency and lower our costs. So over time, that’s going to be a very good acquisition and part of our strategy around chemicals.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.
Angie Sedita: So, Jeff, just to dig into a little bit further, the comments on the Permian and the customer behavior, some are moving forward and very active and then some you’re saying are reducing activity or adding fewer than expected rigs. And then, maybe you could give a little bit more color on the mix as far as the number of customers that are starting to see some slowing of activity? And then, also your comments on the pricing pressure in some areas, just a little more color there would be great.
Jeff Miller: Okay. Thanks, Angie. But look, Permian off-take has nominal impact today. But, as I described, it’s not naïve to the math. I mean, clearly, this is the world class resource. And the entrepreneurs in that market will get it solved, I mean never bet against them. But in the near term, I think perception has as much impact as anything. And by that, I mean weighs on customer urgency, which ultimately has an impact on our utilization and efficiency. But look, no doubt this is world class resource. As far as more color, not much more to give other than a couple of very small but leading, and I would say, nominal factors at this point with respect to off-take.
Angie Sedita: Okay. So, as I think about 2019 and obviously you’re positive on the outlook for 2019, but if we put in the context of pricing is flattish, I think you’ve done a very good job in the past. And correct me if I am wrong that the biggest driver of your margins are efficiency gains, not pricing. So, thoughts on the ability to drive margins in 2019 and maybe potentially a flat market environment for pricing?
Jeff Miller: Look, Angie, we’re very confident in the levers that we have and excited about how those continued to get rolled out, and I described some of them in the call. But I think what’s important is along the way as we get the ‘19 and beyond, I want to deliver the highest North American revenues and the best returns in North America. So, we’re going to take whatever the market gives us and get an outsized share of that. Also along the way, we delivered terrific free cash flow. And so, I believe Halliburton is where you want to be. And I think those other levers, in fact I know those other levers well in place, moving to ‘19.
Chris Weber: Yes. I mean, you look at ‘19, and Jeff talked about demand on the books starting in early next year. We would expect that to positively impact utilization and positively impact pricing.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Sean Meakim: So, Jeff, maybe just to clarify little further on frac. Leading edge in the Permian, can you give us a sense of where your folks in the field see pricing heading and how you think that could eventually flow through into your fleets over the next couple of quarters?
Jeff Miller: Look, Sean, I’ll be crazy to talk about pricing strategy on this call. I mean, this is not a place where we’ll discuss that. I know that our competitors, all of our competitors, probably most of our customers are listening. But, what we’re committed to do is what’s best for both our customers and our shareholders.
Sean Meakim: Okay. Fair enough. So, internationally, it sounds like you’re going to feel some impact of the startup cost in some of these projects, similar to what you’ve heard from your peers. Is that a fair characterization? And as we look towards 2019, would you say that there is going to be opportunities for increased growth capital, internationally?
Jeff Miller: Yes, I think there will be in 2019. I’m very, very excited about what we’re seeing unfold internationally. And we’ll see some of that in the second half of 2018 with respect to increase in activity. There will be some mobilization around that. But, as we look out to 2019 and really beyond, yes. I mean, I see a solid demand set coming together in front of us. And I’ve been I think pretty clear on international outlook over this last cycle and believe we’re right now. And as we see that grow into 2019, we’ll need some capital, but it’s probably, as we get into the year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open.
Bill Herbert: Hey. Good morning, guys. So, I just want to discuss a little bit with regards to the timing of the proceeds, kind of recovery if that’s the right word for the Permian with regard to the resolution, these takeaway capacity issues. Totally agree that these are transient, but most of the incremental capacity comes on second half of ‘19. We’ve got an exceptionally tight labor market in the Permian, the whole value chain is super tight. This could actually get pushed out by a little bit. So, I’m just curious, in light of the fact that this could be a multi-quarter stagnation, if you will, with regard to Permian, call it four quarters, maybe a bit more, who in the heck knows, yet we’re maintaining the capital spending budget, Chris at $2 billion for this year. Walk us through that.
Chris Weber: From that capital budget perspective, we planned or set, and we’ve got a good view with regards to what we’re putting into Sperry and what we’re doing. So, it’s allowed us about positioning for ‘19 but and a lot of that capital is focused towards international, not necessarily just North America. So, we feel like it’s still in the right place.
Jeff Miller: I guess, I’ll follow that up as well, Bill. I’ll go back to the ability to react very quickly, to capital requirements in North America. So, unlike our competitors, there are no orders that we placed a year ago that are being delivered today. We can move as quickly as 30 days, if required to move in 30 days. So, we continue to look for leading edge, pricing returns, and we have a really great business development organization. So, we know how to get things placed quickly and don’t pull the capital lever until all of those conditions are right.
Bill Herbert: Okay. So, in the event that this is a little bit slower for longer than anticipated, and the deployment of incremental horsepower slows down?
Jeff Miller: Yes. 
Bill Herbert: Okay. Got it. And then, the second question for me is switching gears to international. At this stage, it just seems like rest of the world oil prices ex-Permian, if you will, look to be pretty constructive with regard to supply and demand fundamentals, based upon a myriad of different factors that we all know about. So, in light of the visibility improving for international, do you think at this juncture, the expectation for a double-digit increase in revenues for 2019 is realistic, and ditto for D&E, as a result of that formulation?
Jeff Miller: Realistic is the short answer. I mean, all of the things that we sort of thought would unfold around supply are unfolding. And declines because of underinvestment are starting to manifest. And that sets us for a terrific sort of long-term ramp internationally. And feel like, even in the Permian, as we described that that’s a moderation in growth as opposed to a pullback.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Jim Wicklund: Good morning, guys. Jeff, you have laid out the long-term -- the longer term issues very well. There is no question that that the Permian is a world class asset and will -- supposed to be 60% of global oil growth for the next three to five years. But, what this does do is it -- is sets it back a couple of quarters. Investors often care more about the short-term than the longer term and your sock is down 7% on the open on this morning. And so, the real question is, how long does it take you to get back to where we expected Q3 to be in your internal planning? And I’m not going to -- I don’t want to belabor earnings or anything, but you just got it down $0.10 for Q3, and that obviously means we’re going to have some got down in Q4. In your planning, when do we get back on track to where Q3 was expected to be? Is this a two-quarter event, a three-quarter event, or fourth-quarter event? And while I -- I know we don’t know, I’m just talking about your expectation of the market today. When do we get back on track? The market’s at discounting mechanism, we’re now discounting different -- six months ahead. So, it’s kind of like when do we get back on track? I have no question of long-term trajectory but how long does this garden leave this pause actually last?
Jeff Miller: Well, Jim, I think we see -- I will go back to the perspective on what we saw the Williston recover; we’ve seen the DJ Basin is in the midst of takeaway capacity, and that’s being resolved. And I would bet on the sooner rather than later in terms of West Texas. But, I expect that we do in the meantime is make a lot of free cash flow between now and when that’s resolved and expect that it happens -- while I say sooner rather than later, there are probably lots of things that can be done to improve that as they work through 2019, but it’s certainly within the confines of 2019.
Jim Wicklund: Okay, within the confines of 2019 helps a lot. And you’ve had a higher debt-to-cap ratio following the paycheck to Baker, running about 50%. You talked about how you’re going to pay off your $500 million and your $400 million this year, and then look at buying back stock. What’s the current goal or objective on a debt-to-cap ratio or an EBITDA ratio, however you want to do it? Where do you need to get the balance sheet to go before you start getting more aggressive in stock buybacks with all the free cash flow generation?
Chris Weber: So, we’ve talked about target credit metrics, debt-to-EBITDA under 2.5 times and comfortable on that. Debt-to-cap, as you mentioned is still low 50s. We want that to be down in the 30. So, some work to do there. We’ve made a lot of progress on debt repayment, $1.5 billion in 2017, targeting about another $1 billion in second half of this year. That’s 2.5 billion in total over two years, and that’s put a meaningful impact on credit metrics. But, we still have some work to do. And we’ll be thoughtful about looking for opportunities to do that going forward, as we think about how to deploy excess cash. But, consistent with what we said before, we’re not going to look to pay big premiums to retire debt. We will be thoughtful and efficient about how we do it, but again, balancing that with growth, things like the Athlon acquisition and return of cash to shareholders.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open.
David Anderson: You talked about having seeing some of these efficiency drags in the past, not the first you’ve seen some of efficiencies creep up. I was hoping you could talk about kind of how this cycle compares to last cycle, particularly with E&P trends. So, we’ve been hearing a lot of about these four-well pads being the preferred size, some of them being drilled simultaneously here in bigger pads. So, I am just curious, as the operations start to scale up, I would think this really increases your visibility into customer activity quite a bit more, particularly with DUC inventories. Can you talk about how that potentially can help you during issues like this and whether or not that can actually ultimately lift your margins going forward, this increased visibility you have? Because I don’t think you’ve ever had visibility like this in the past on your customers.
Jeff Miller: No. I mean, these -- thank you, David. These are bigger capital expenditures than what you typically see in unconventionals but it also increases utilization and your better utilization throughout the day. It also allows us to better organize work. And because of the size of these, yes, there is more visibility of them sort of as the say manifest out in front of us. I also think though, it’s a demonstration of just the market moving towards better returns, in general. So, it’s as our customers look for ways to produce more and more quickly and try to give returns sooner in the cycle on the types of capital investments required for these larger pads.
David Anderson: On the completely different subject. On your international commentary, you’ve talked about competitors aggressively taking up some of these lower price tenders out there. You talked somewhat positively about pricing going forward. I got this sense in your commentary that capacity is tightened up now to the point internationally that you feel better about the pricings on contract going forward or is there something with the mix of the contracts that are coming out that suggest the pricing or margins for bidders could be better.
Jeff Miller: Couple of things there. So, first, we are seeing some tightening in certain markets. And I think, it’s got going to be -- sort of international is a really big place. We can’t paint it with only one brush. As I described North Sea, seeing some tightness there, we’ll see some tightness in markets as we move around. And as a baseline of work is tendered, the follow-on work after that quite frankly is where there is more opportunity from a pricing standpoint or bidding, tendering standpoint to do things around price. And I expect that will unfold as we work into ‘19. But the base level of business is always very competitive, and that’s where a lot of efficiencies and work is done to improve those. But, so, my comment around tightness is, I think I’m seeing some tightness in certain service lines, as I described billing tools, which I think will drive some tightness. But, it’s more -- it will come in sort of geographies. Now, unfortunately, we’re seeing this across a number of geographies in terms of an uptick. But as far as that tightness goes, that will be sort of one at a time, I expect.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Scott Gruber: Jeff, I want to circle back to Bill’s line of inquiry and international growth potential, double-digit potential next year, which is great to hear. What’s your view on how the international cycle evolves, not just over the next 12 months, but let’s look out over the next three years. What I’m curious about are, are we going to see a genuine deepwater recovery, are we going to see a genuine exploration cycle? And what I mean by genuine is not just a bounce off the bottom, which given the decline we’ve seen, 10% would really be just that, just the bounce off the bottom. Are we setting the stage here for multiple years of double-digit growth on international side and within deepwater?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Deepwater, as I’ve always said is sort of the last to come back into the frame. And I think deepwater still is push to the right as far as widespread recovery. But, the macro that we see shaping up is certainly encouraging, but the kind of deepwater, new AFE type activity I expect is going to require confidence in what is the long term outlook on the forward-look on oil, which I think is improving and is reaching a point that it’s supportive. So, as we look out a couple of years, I think that’s where we see inside of that three-year window, as you described it, as we see deepwater pick up, probably in a more meaningful way. And exploration, again, the exploration that we’re seeing so far has been certainly more focused around sort of step outs and things that are near to existing infrastructure, generally speaking. And I think more confidence, a, in cash flows and by our clients. And again, speculating here, but I would expect that as confidence builds, so will that.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And an unrelated follow-up here. What’s your view on the market penetration potential of electric frac fleets? Is this a technology that can move beyond a niche application? And where do you stand on the development of a fully electric frac offering?
Jeff Miller: Well, we look at everything through the lens of returns, and that hasn’t changed. So, we’ve certainly done some work around electric frac fleets and have tested that process and how -- and what we think about it. Not convinced today that -- well, I shouldn’t say that, but we need to see that unfold and see what are the real return capabilities of that, mean the physics say, it still has to generate energy. We have to move big things around. So, I’m not as convinced that we see the type of return around the cost of that, it’s probably a 2X cost of getting into that electric sort of power generation versus what we’re able to accomplish today.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is now open.
Kurt Hallead: So, hey, Jeff, great color, commentary so far. So, something to maybe explore a little bit more on the fact that you talked about, you have demand on the books going out into 2019. It sounds like that is very much geared toward the international market. I just want to get some clarity that is it mostly international or does it also include some Permian. And in your mind is this tend to be a little bit earlier than usual and all your customers, especially on the international front getting some sense of urgency to get moving?
Jeff Miller: No. That’s more -- I mean, that comment is a North America comment in terms of activity that we see in 2019. Certainly, in markets where -- really across the piece, there is demand. We still have inbound demand in a market like this. So, I’m describing efficiency, the challenges to utilization efficiency through the second half of the year. But, that’s not to say we don’t see inbound demand today. And we also see very strong demand as we go into 2019. That’s the North America comment. As I talked about international, again, we see a contract set that we won today. And we also have visibility of, sort of, as I described last quarter, the doubling of tender activity. That’s all going to manifest over the second half of this year. And so, I’d make the same comment internationally. I mean, just like I say, this is a great outlook and a great market.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. And then, you referenced the fact that U.S. land margins were approaching that peak level in 2014. I know that in prior comments target’s been put out there, about 20% -- reaching 20% by the end of 2018. Given your most recent comments about some elements of slowdown or increased maintenance CapEx, do you still think it’s feasible to get to the 20% margin by the end of the year?
Jeff Miller: Look, what we are doing is making decisions around longer term. And it’s critical that we deliver leading returns and most free cash flow that we can deliver, we’re going to lead the market in doing those things. And so, the kind of decision we could have made -- getting to the target could have happened last quarter, this quarter or next quarter. But, those decisions would be shortsighted, in my view, not right for the business. So, as I said, what hasn’t changed is Halliburton does have largest revenues, highest margins, best returns. And so, we’re going to do those things to capture as much of 2019 as you expect and probably more. All of these things, as I’ve said solve themselves as we go into 2019, and I’m really excited about next year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Waqar Syed: Good morning. My question relates to pressure pumping capacity. I think, in the past you’ve said that the market may still be undersupplied by about 0.5 million hydraulic horsepower. What’s your current thinking and where do you think in the second half, based on what capacity additions are coming in, what the supply demand balance looks like?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, Waqar. I mean, because of the things I’ve described this morning, I mean, I think the total market is temporarily balanced. And I know our equipment is sold out and we could sell more. And that’s because of there’s a lot of demand for what Halliburton does from a service quality standpoint, reliability, efficiency and technology. And the demand or the pressure, the work rolled on the equipment hasn’t changed, and that’s the -- so, it means that the attrition story hasn’t changed either. And we still see probably half of the incremental horsepower that comes into the market being ploughed back into existing fleets, and that’s reason I spend so much time and we spend so much time managing fleet size. And we have fleet sizes that are well below the industry average and that’s how we -- one of the ways that we deliver leading returns.
Waqar Syed: Okay. And just a follow-up on that. We had about decoupling pumping services from fracs and supply. Are you seeing the same trends and how would that impact margins for you guys and then are you going to change any strategy as a result of that changing trend?
Jeff Miller: I mean, with respect sand, the de-bundling, that’s a mixed bag. Ultimately, customers hire Halliburton to pump sand downhole, that’s what we get paid for. And we make money off a range of business models today and will continue to make margins off of making better wells. So, I don’t see a change in our strategy there. But, obviously, we look at everything through a returns lens and whatever that best returning model is, is how we view that.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for any closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Candice. Before we close, I would like to wrap up with a few key points. First, I believe we are in the beginning of a prolonged upcycle in both North America and the international markets, and Halliburton is best positioned to grow and expand margins. Second, we expect to generate strong free cash flow and plan to reduce our outstanding debt levels, and are targeting to initiate share repurchases. Finally, our value proposition resonates with our customers and delivers industry-leading returns to our shareholders. So, I’ll look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Candice, please close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Finally, after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. Let’s get right to it this morning. In the first quarter, Halliburton experienced significant challenges in North America related to rail disruptions. One of the things I’m pleased with is the way our organization executed through the sand logistics complexities in order to minimize disruptions for our customers. The company you want to own and work with is a company that can execute through these issues and any other potential headwinds. Halliburton identified the problem, addressed it and worked through it. Business conditions are back to where we thought they would be. As a result, I really like what I see shaping up and I am confident in our ability to reach normalized margins in North America this year. After taking into account the impact from rail, we wrapped up the quarter in line with what we expected. Here are our highlights for the quarter. Total company revenue of $5.7 billion represents a 34% increase compared to the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating income was $619 million driven by robust market conditions in North America. Once again, for the last five quarters, we have delivered the highest returns in the industry. I’m very pleased with the way our North America business exited the quarter. In March, our production enhancement product service line achieved record stage count per crew, higher than at the previous peak in 2014. Our international run rate for tender activity in 2018 is on a pace to double 2017 levels. Our Completion and Production division was impacted by U.S. rail disruption during the quarter but we still achieved a strong exit to the quarter with March margins in the mid upper teens. Finally, our Drilling and Evaluation division had strong year-over-year revenue growth of 15% with operating income growing 54%. Today, all eyes are on North America as it continues to play a larger role as a global producer. Activity in the U.S. remains resilient as our customers have a large portfolio of economically viable projects in today’s commodity price environment. We expect our customers to remain busy through the rest of 2018 creating significant demand for our services. The combination of steady rig count growth and completions intensity is improving demand across all of our product service lines. In addition, we believe the pressure pumping market is undersupplied today and will remain tight for the rest of 2018. Despite the incremental horsepower coming into the market, I believe this undersupply will persist as wear and tear continues to degrade existing equipment. I’ve been saying this for a bunch of quarters; degradation is real. Roughly 50% of announced horsepower does not translate into new crews. I know this because we analyze the difference between horsepower additions announced and the related number of crews that are produced. This means that about half the new build equipment is being used to replace or add to crews already in the field. A key driver of this degradation is service intensity which quickly translates to shorter equipment lives and higher maintenance costs. Maintenance costs are growing and the costs are real. Today, we pump three to four times of sand volume through equipment compared to 2014. We’ve moved away from gel-based frac to slick water frac increasing the abrasion on our equipment. At the same time, we increased the pumping rate compounding the wear and tear on equipment. And with increased efficiency, we’ve improved utilization achieving more pumping hours per day; again, more wear and tear. In this environment, Halliburton has a clear advantage with our proprietary equipment and preventative maintenance technology that reduces our relative maintenance expense. The expansion in our operating margins over the last year demonstrates our superior ability to manage through the increased maintenance. We have generated industry-leading returns while expensing our maintenance costs in contrast to many of our competitors who capitalize their costs. The current activity level in the U.S. is continuing to create tightness across the supply chain. The three most significant areas of supply chain tightness that we see are rail, trucking and labor. I’ll address how we’re handling each of these next. The first quarter was a tough quarter for sand delivery. I learned more about train logistics than I ever dreamed I would; proof that getting to the future first is not always fun. We were the first to recognize the rail issue and describe it for the market. I appreciate the hard work by our sand desk to minimize the disruptions to our customers while a significant volume of our sand supply was impacted by the rail stoppages. As I stated before, this issue is temporary and is behind us. Looking forward, the U.S. rail system is experiencing high demand driven by strong economic activity. This increased overall demand is adding stress to the rail system, while at the same time our industry is attempting to move more and more sand every quarter. This stress is making the timing of deliveries less predictable. Our sophisticated sand supply desk and logistics system is working to mitigate this problem. I believe the ultimate solution is the increased use of local sand. We intend to utilize those resources to provide services for our customers as increased supply comes online in the latter half of the year. After rail, the next logistics bottleneck is trucking. The issue today is not in tractors and trailers, it’s finding qualified drivers and dealing with congested infrastructure. Containerized sand is an effective tool to reduce demurrage and truck demand per well site. We continue to roll out our containerized sand solution currently deployed across about a third of our fleet to reduce cost, increase efficiency and improve our service quality. The labor market is tight. U.S. unemployment is at an all-time low and in some basins it’s just above 2%. That is tight. We have the advantage of being able to recruit nationally to find qualified field personnel. However, given the level of activity today, there will likely be wage inflation and additional pricing will be necessary for cost recovery. I view these supply chain constraints as a welcome sign of a growing market and expect to execute through these challenges on our path to normalized margins in North America this year. We remain on the path to normalized margins and our March performance was a strong step in the right direction. To get to these margins, we will pull the three levers that I’ve discussed several times over the last year. Price is clearly important and we push price every day; first to recover costs and then to gain net pricing. Our customers understand that we have to get both cost recovery as well as return to a price that is healthy for our business. Just as important as price is utilization which we continue to optimize as the market grows. Our scale makes us even more valuable to Halliburton. And finally playing into both pricing and utilization is technology. Technology creates value for our customers, and at the same time reduces cost for Halliburton. As the market grows, North America’s role in the global supply equation is changing. This fundamental shift means that North America’s shale oil has moved from swing producer to base-load supplier to meet growing global demand. Nothing is more evident of this change than our customers actively redirecting spending from international non-OPEC opportunities towards North America. This shift in CapEx allocation is largely driven by the shorter cycle return and lower risk profile North America shale provides. This change didn’t happen overnight. In fact, it’s been occurring over the last several years. In this paradigm, we see sustainable growth over a longer period of time rather than the boom and bust, which has characterized past cycles in North America. This sustained activity is good for Halliburton. It allows us to leverage our supply chain logistics infrastructure, capture efficiencies around repair and maintenance programs and implement technologies at scale to reduce cost and increase production. Therefore, we can optimize our systems and be more efficient with our investments. This is important because in this environment Halliburton will generate strong free cash flow. Turning to the international markets, Halliburton has never been better positioned for recovery than it is today. Halliburton is in every meaningful market competing for work, winning work and executing work with outstanding service quality. This is not something I could have said ahead of the prior cycle. I’ve always said you have to be present to win and Halliburton is more than present. We are winning. In Latin America, I see improving activity offset by pricing pressures throughout the year. I am pleased with the footprint and legacy we have in Latin America and our market share today is a testament to our focus on service quality throughout the cycle. In Argentina, there are exciting improvements in unconventional resources. We successfully completed the longest lateral section ever in the Vaca Muerta formation, flawlessly pumping 42 stages, a great job by the team demonstrating their focus on our value proposition in Argentina. In addition, a record number of blocks are scheduled to be auctioned in Mexico and Brazil representing a pipeline of service activity in the coming years. We look forward to working with our customers to maximize the value of their investments. Certainly a lowlight for the quarter is the write-down of our remaining assets in Venezuela. We continue to work at a reduced level as we believe the ultimate path for resolution in Venezuela involves oil and gas. In the Middle East and Asia, we’ve experienced modest increases in activity offset by pricing pressure. We’ve grown our market share in this region throughout the downturn on the strength of our service quality and technology offerings. In the first quarter, we delivered the industry’s first in-situ bubble point measurement using our wireline CoreVault technology. This data is important for reservoir characterization allowing our customers to better understand their gas to oil ratio before flowing the well to surface. By collaborating with customers, we continue to create technology that improves our services and maximizes their asset value. In Europe, Africa, CIS, typical seasonality created a dip in activity for the first quarter but we expect to see modest rig count growth throughout the year. I expect initial activity increases to be in the North Sea, Nigeria and Ghana. One highlight from the region is progress around digital applications. We continue to believe that our approach to digital which focuses on open architecture, solving business problems and working with partners will prove the most effective over time. I remain encouraged by the long-term prospects of the international markets. Green shoots of activity are starting to create areas of localized tightness but this additional activity is not enough to reverse the pricing pressure we are under today. The run rate for 2018 international tendering activity is on a pace to double from 2017 which leads us to believe that there will be improved activity in 2019 to help soak up resources and create and opportunity for pricing inflection. Before I conclude, I want to spend a moment talking about Sperry Drilling because I am really excited about what I see. Sperry developed and launched several exciting technologies in the last year. First is EARTHSTAR, our very deep resistivity service which provides customers greater reservoir insight to create better wells by utilizing improved mapping and real-time geosteering decisions. Next is our ICRUISE intelligent rotary steerable system that reduces drilling time and increases well placement accuracy to optimize asset value for our customers. And finally, our new upgraded fleet of drilling motors are proving effective in U.S. land. These motors are more powerful and have improved reliability maximizing drilling efficiency for our customers. I am really excited about these technologies and the enthusiasm we’re seeing from our customers. We supercharged our R&D spend for this drilling technology and we made terrific progress in a short period of time. The market for these technologies and additional equipment in our development pipeline is growing. For this reason, we will spend a big part of this year’s capital budget on these tools. I expect the investment to generate attractive returns in the years ahead. Overall, I am excited about the market outlook for the remainder of the year. I am confident in Halliburton’s ability to grow revenue and expand margin in North America and the strength and performance of our international business as the international recovery unfolds. Our strategy is executable, it’s working well and resonates with our customers. Our strategy is delivering industry-leading returns and I am confident that it will continue to do so. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Chris for a financial update.
Chris Weber: Thanks, Jeff. Let’s start with a summary of our first quarter results compared to the first quarter of 2017. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.7 billion and adjusted operating income was $619 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 34% and over 200%, respectively. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in North America. Moving to our division results. In our Completion and Production division, revenue increased by 46% and operating income was in tripled to $500 million. These results were primarily due to improvements in United States land. Additionally, results improved due to increased well completion services in Europe, Africa, CIS and higher stimulation activity in the Middle East. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased by 15% while operating income increased 54%. These results were primarily driven by increased drilling activity in North America and the Eastern Hemisphere, particularly in the North Sea. These results were partially offset by activity declines across multiple product service lines in Latin America. In North America, revenue increased 58%. This improvement was led by increased activity throughout the United States land sector in the majority of Halliburton’s product service lines, primarily pressure pumping, as well as higher drilling and artificial lift activity. Latin America revenue decreased by 1% due to activity declines in Venezuela and Mexico. These results were partially offset by increases in drilling and pressure pumping services in Argentina. Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, we saw revenue improve by 19% mainly due to higher drilling activity and well completion services in the North Sea, coupled with increased activity in Russia and Azerbaijan. These results were partially offset by activity reductions in Angola. In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue increased 7%. This increase is largely the result of increased drilling and stimulation activity in the Middle East and increased drilling activity in Indonesia, offset by lower completion tool sales and project management activity in the Middle East. Regarding Venezuela, as a result of recent changes in its foreign currency exchange system and continued devaluation of the local currency, combined with U.S. sanctions and ongoing political and economic challenges, we wrote down all of our remaining investment in the country. This resulted in a $312 million, net of tax charge during the first quarter. We continue to work in Venezuela and carefully manage our go-forward exposure. In the first quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $69 million and net interest expense was $140 million in line with our previous guidance. We expect these items to continue at this run rate in the second quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter, excluding Venezuela-related charges, came in at approximately 21% as a result of U.S. tax reform and our geographic earnings mix. Going forward, we expect our 2018 full year and second quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $572 million with capital expenditures of $501 million ending the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $2.3 billion. For the full year 2018, we now anticipate our CapEx spend to be about $2 billion. We like what the market is showing us for 2018 and beyond and while spending slightly more than our D&A, customer demand supports this investment and we expect it to generate attractive returns. We ended the quarter with 2.3 billion in cash and expect to generate strong free cash flow in 2018. Consistent with prior years, we expect our cash balance to grow in the second half of the year. Now, turning to our thoughts on the second quarter. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we expect our revenue and margin to be similar to the first quarter, primarily due to continued pricing pressure in the international market offsetting activity increases. In our Completion and Production division, we expect strong revenue and margin growth driven by the strengthening North America market. Based on what we see today we believe current second quarter consensus EPS provides a good target for our performance. Let me turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Chris. Let me sum it up. First, I want to thank all of our employees for what they do to deliver our value proposition every day. It really matters and we saw it this quarter. In North America, I am pleased with the way Halliburton executed through the quarter given the challenges we faced. We managed through the supply chain issues and exited the quarter on the path to normalized margins. Looking ahead, I am excited about the way the North America market is shaping up for the remainder of the year and the role it is playing in the global supply. My view on the international market remains intact. I’m encouraged by the activity outlook that should ultimately lead to price inflection in 2019. We are the execution company. We are focused on service quality, capital discipline, generating superior financial performance and delivering industry-leading shareholder returns. Now, let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
James West: Good morning, guys.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, James.
James West: Jeff, I want to dig in a little more on the pressure pumping market. I think you gave some good color there on what you guys are seeing, and there’s been some commentary suggesting different factors at play here and perhaps that’s because you’re sold out and demand’s coming in and others are trying to put equipment to work. But I wonder if you could talk to some of the dynamics you’re seeing both the supply and the demand side? How much demand is running above supply these days, how long this could stay tight and then how that’s going to factor in into pricing for Halliburton in particular?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, James. It is different. Our customers are asking us for equipment. We’re not trying to put older equipment into the market. And because of that it makes for a totally different conversation. But I think backing up and looking at overall supply and demand, it looks like the market’s undersupplied probably 1 million, 1.5 million horsepower today, and I expect that it stays that way certainly for this year and likely beyond, and a lot of that is because of the attrition that I talk about that is very real, and we look at horsepower announcements versus actual fleet adds. And all that does is it affected about half of the horsepower announced is going back into existing fleets tells me that that market stays tight. And so for that reason from our perspective anyway, we see solid pricing. We push it every day. We’re not going to get into the strategy around how we do that, but certainly see cost to cover – pricing to cover inflation out there as well as pushing on the net pricing side of that as well.
James West: Okay. So we should think that the net pricing gains will continue for that time period as well?
Jeff Miller: Yes.
James West: Okay, perfect. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is now open.
Bill Herbert: Good morning, Jeff. With regard to international, as you went through all three different geo markets, it struck me that the continued refrain is activity going to offset – not partially offset by pricing, and yet your international top line was up 8.5% year-over-year. So do we expect international top line for the year to be up for Halliburton or does – as the year unfold, the year-over-year gain is compressed to the point where topline is flat?
Jeff Miller: No, we should see some – I think we outgrow the expected spend internationally. So I see the top line is up for the full year 2018.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And then with regard to – it seems that pricing remains pretty corrosive. I’m just curious, is pricing continuing to go down or has it stabilized at really oppressive levels?
Jeff Miller: No, I would say pricing continues to go down. I mean, we look at pricing internationally. We’re excited about the volume of activity and we like to see more tenders. But I can tell you our customers know that we’re at the bottom as well. And so from our perspective price is actually continuing to move down not up internationally as we start to see the large projects come through. So I expect that we see inflection in 2019, expect that we gain share as we work through the cycle and that’s why we see revenues up for the full year. But clearly that is going to offset the benefit from higher activity.
Bill Herbert: Okay.
Chris Weber: As we do see, like we said on D&E which is largely international, flattish second quarter to first, but we would expect as we move into the second half of the year that we’ll see it – start to see some improvement in our international results and thus our D&E results. Not a lot, but some incremental improvement as we get closer to that inflection point that we’re seeing in 2019 that Jeff talked about.
Bill Herbert: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Sean.
Sean Meakim: Good morning. So, Jeff, maybe if we could talk about where your contract position sits for frac, just thinking about your existing fleet versus leading edge pricing, how much that roll forward do you think will support incremental margins through the year even if net pricing were more on the flatter side, just to give us a sense of how much that impact could be?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Sean. Let’s go back and talk about the three levers. So price is always important. So when I look at margin progression, clearly price is important. But at the same time utilization is an important lever and allows us to move on the margin front as does technology help us do the same thing, and technology in effect helps our customers generate more value but at the same time reduces our cost, and that’s the important piece of that in terms of supporting our margin expansion outlook for the balance of the year. Our business development guys are in the market every single day, and because of our efficiency and technology and science, I mean that’s the price support for what we do. But at the same time, those other two levers are very important.
Sean Meakim: So in terms of looking through the year, fair to say that there’s still some pull forward as your backlog of contracts roll into current pricing, so that’s a net tailwind for you?
Jeff Miller: Yes, I would say if we look back a year now and talk about the contracts that we had there, a large part of that has rolled over. And so what we look at now is improving the margins on the contracts that we have. And a lot of this does get to efficiency and this is one of the reasons why our business development team is so focused on where are the customers where we can get the best efficiency and utilization. That’s a key part of how we expand margins. And so that opportunity is clearly still there. Customers remain urgent and that customer urgency is critical because even spending within cash flow, for example, urgency around effectiveness of every dollar spent matters a lot and that may not have been the case two years ago at the absolute bottom of the downturn but today that is a critical factor for our customers. And again where we spend a lot of our energy is making sure that we are able to execute that way.
Sean Meakim: Got it, understood. And then just thinking about the other service lines in North America, curious how pricing progressed end of quarter when thinking about drilling services, cementing, wireline, coiled tubing? You touched on it a little bit in prepared comments but just what are your expectations for those other lines as we move through the year and the impact on C&P as well as C&E?
Jeff Miller: Well, I think none of those service lines declined as much as pressure pumping did through the downturn, so they don’t have as far to move up. Though that said, I do expect a growing market and as the rig count rise up I suspect we’ll see more tightness around those things and the ability to move price up modestly.
Sean Meakim: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS. Your line is now open.
Jeff Miller: Angie?
Angie Sedita: Good morning, guys. Sorry about that. Jeff, so I agree. There’s certainly a big difference between incremental horsepower and replacement horsepower. Can you give us your thoughts on how much horsepower incrementally do you think is coming into the market? And then you touched on also a very fair point on the ability to deploy new versus older equipment and maybe talk about the pricing differential on the newer equipment versus the older equipment?
Jeff Miller: Sure, Angie. We look at sort of headline horsepower in the marketplace. We think it’s probably 18 million horsepower, somewhere in that range. We look at what’s been announced in terms of new build and reactivations that comes to maybe 4.5 million horsepower. Of that, we expect roughly half of that is going to get plowed back into existing fleets. In Halliburton, we’ve maintained our fleets at 36,000 horsepower on average which tells me that we’re getting differential performance around that equipment. And so that clearly in my view with the kind of rig count that we have today and the outlook for growth this year keeps that tight. And so I think that’s how we see it unfolding for the balance of the year. Now your question around horsepower age, so much of that has to do – we think about our horsepower in terms of how effective is it on location and clearly we’ve got proprietary technology around our pumping and in other things we do around maintenance, et cetera. And I think because of that, we’re differentially positioned in the market and of course that has an impact on where we can work, how effective we are, what kind of margins we can earn.
Angie Sedita: All right, okay, fair enough. And then I don’t know if you can talk about it at a high level as far as the pricing mechanism of your contracts. Is it fair to think that the majority of your contracts are re-priced at the beginning of the year or is it daggered, number one? And then midyear as pricing continues potentially to move higher, do you have an opportunity to revisit it or is it normally done once a year, twice a year? Or just at a high level, how do those contracts work?
Jeff Miller: Angie, that’s really maybe the way it was several years ago. But I’d say today it’s staggered. It’s all over the place as we work through the downturn and back out of the downturn, a lot of variability in what contracts look like. So I certainly wouldn’t frame it that way. Really it’s a matter of execution every day and demonstrating the value so that we can have a value discussion.
Angie Sedita: All right, thanks, Jeff. I’ll turn it over.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Jud Bailey: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about or circle back on getting back to normalized margins this year and all the discussion around pricing. Jeff, just to be clear, do you think you could hit normalized margins this year if leading-edge frac pricing does not increase from here or we’re trying to get an understanding of what can be efficiency driven, what’s just simply new contracts rolling up to kind of leading edge if you could help us think through that please?
Jeff Miller: Yes, the short answer is price is always important but I talk about the three levers because I believe we get there on the back of improving utilization and technology. And I’ve said that for a long time. Pricing’s certainly helpful but not a requirement.
Jud Bailey: Okay, all right. Thanks for that. And my follow up is on the higher CapEx. Could you maybe give us a little bit of insight as to maybe where that incremental capital is going to go? You mentioned Sperry and ramping up there. How much of it maybe replacement and how do you think about the return on that incremental capital you’re going to be spending this year?
Chris Weber: Jud, this is Chris. Like we said, we bumped our CapEx budget. Now I think so full year will be about $2 billion, a little bit higher than we were guiding before. And I think it’s important to note that we’re pretty thoughtful about our capital investment decisions always looking at it through the returns lens and is it going to be value accretive, is it going to generate attractive returns. And that’s what we saw with the opportunity with regards to the CapEx rate. And the majority of the increase is going into Sperry. And so we’re excited about it. As Jeff talked about, this is a product line that we underinvested in for a number of years. This is a strategic priority for the organization. We’re seeing great demand both for existing technology and the new technology and it’s actually positioning equipment for work in 2019. And we think we’ll generate attractive returns over the long term. So we’re excited about the opportunity. But this CapEx raise in terms of guidance doesn’t change our outlook or expectation for generating strong free cash flow this year nor our focus on capital discipline.
Jud Bailey: Okay, got it. I appreciate it. I’ll turn it back. Thank you.
Chris Weber: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is now open.
David Anderson: Thanks. Good morning. Jeff, just kind of a general question around the normalized margin target. Now you’re reiterating that margin target. Can you just help us understand how you define normalized? It seems like everybody has a different view on what that means. Just curious what that means to you in terms of activity utilization and pricing?
Jeff Miller: Yes, Dave, I’ve defined normalized margins as 20%. That’s been something we’ve talked about it over some period of time and that’s where I think the business settles. And if we go – we were getting to that place, we were at that place in 2014 realistically. What we had was demand go away but it wasn’t necessarily an oversupplied market. What we had was a downturn where demand went away. But I fully expect that we’ll work back into that range and that’s just what we’re doing with the levers I described. Clearly price is important but the kind of utilization that we’re able to get today because of our process or technology that’s always a key component of any kind of margin outperformance.
David Anderson: So in other words this is sort of a steady-state level that you think you can achieve for a couple of years here at these levels based on what you mean by normalized?
Jeff Miller: Yes, that’s why I used the word normalized because really we’d always describe that as a normal range for this business was in that range and the work that we’re doing is build around having this business operate at those levels.
David Anderson: And then if we think about kind of the fourth quarter, we often see some seasonal weakness here in North America. Do you think you can – so does that imply that you should be able to hit this target by third quarter if we assume sort of a downtick in fourth quarter like we usually see?
Jeff Miller: Yes, I would say the behavior of the market probably looks somewhat consistent with what it does sort of every year and I’ll just leave it at that. And in terms of timing, Q4 always have some spotty weather and Q1 this year had cold weather – had the rail issues that we had. So as we work through the year I suspect it’s over the next couple of quarters.
David Anderson: And then a separate question on the sand side. You had talked about increasing use of local sand to mitigate some of these issues that you’re seeing in the first quarter here. Can you give us a sense of how you see that the magnitude of that shift you think is going to happen over the next 12 months? Just kind of curious, sand’s a big portion – a crucial element of your pressure pumping operations you always want to have for your customers. So like roughly how much of that – I’m just trying to get in big picture numbers, so like what percentage of your Permian is sourced from rail and where do you think that could potentially lower to in 12 months?
Jeff Miller: Well, that’s a moving target as we speak. So if we go back six months ago, it was zero and I suspect as we get into some time next year, there is a – for the market anyway there’s a path to oversupply that market from the Permian. And that’s sort of the projects that we see or at least are in process of getting built. So it’s probably never a 100% but it could be a substantial portion of the sand demand in the Permian will come from buy-ins in the Permian. It’s a dynamic we’re starting to see in other basins as well. What it ultimately does is it serves to relieve pressure on rail and then certainly provides for more availability of Northern White to the markets that will probably continue to demand that.
David Anderson: Great. Thank you, Jeff.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
James Wicklund: Good morning, guys.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, James.
James Wicklund: Having worked international for 15 years, the contingency always needed the contingency both on price and time and I understand your comment that the bidding activity is up but we really won’t see the impact until '19. But there’s been a great deal of talk about lump sum turnkey contracts in the Middle East especially and I know that we’ve done those for a while but the level or the percentage of total business appears to have picked up. Can you talk a little bit about where that is today, where that is versus a couple of years ago? Do you do it with the same people or different people? And more importantly, we’re all concerned that lump sum turnkey increases the risk to a company that bids that. Not all of them are executed well. And so the concern is or the hope is that you execute well and boost those margins and maybe surprise us for the upside by the end of the year on results. But can you talk about how that plays into lump sum turnkey contacts play into your view of international?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Jim. As you say, LSTK has been around for a long time. It’s gone by a lot of different names over the years; integrated solutions, IPM, as I say a number of names. I think the key again is execution risk and how well we manage that. We’re not afraid of execution risk and that’s really the basis for the contract is that execution risk. What I do like about them is that they aren’t the kind of investments in oil and gas that take long time in commodity exposure. So from a cash return standpoint, it certainly work. I’d say the key components of executing those well around project management and understanding that risk. We’ve got terrific experience during this. That share for Halliburton grew dramatically through the last two or three years and we’ve done it for a long time. And so the skill sets are different and it takes time to develop those and I’m pleased that we have those skills today at Halliburton and compete very effectively. But I would wrap up with though is that they do get progressively more competitive over time.
James Wicklund: Okay. So the same pricing pressures have to exist in those that exist from the overall market. Okay. And my follow up, if I could, you recorded record stages in the quarter which is good. You talk about the three levers that you can pull. Some people think because you have all this equipment, 100 – spreads out in the field that if they’re out in the field, they’re 100% utilized. Can you talk about – we can all guess what pricing might do but can you talk about the upside to utilization that exists over time in pressure pumping?
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks, Jim. That’s a really meaningful lever for Halliburton. And having spreads spoken for is radically different from utilization in terms of pumping hours per day. And so we spend a lot of time and apply big data and apply algorithms and have a lot of effort put into how do we drive better utilization of our equipment every minute of every day. And there is a lot of room to run there. And that also is why I spend so much time talking about customers and where we are most effective and customers that better utilize our value proposition because that is truly a win-win. But again to go back to the idea is there’s plenty of room for us to run in that regard.
James Wicklund: Okay. Gentlemen, thank you very much.
Jeff Miller: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Scott Gruber: Good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Scott.
Scott Gruber: Jeff, as we think about potential inflection in international pricing in 2019, what level of market growth do you think about that’s required to drive that inflection? Is it a mid-single digit growth rate, again, so the market’s efficient? Do we need to get the high-single digits, low-double digits? How do you think about what’s required to drive some pricing next year?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Scott. It’s probably less than overall market number though mid upper single digits is a good place to think. But it’s more around specific markets where we see tightness. And part of what we see right now is a sort of thinly spread addition of sort of activity is not sufficient in any particular market to create the tightness that would allow for pricing inflection. And so I think it’s better to look at particular markets as we go through this process and it is maybe the overall. Clearly there’s a place where overall growth is enough to create overall tightness. But I think the early innings of this will look more like specific markets or technologies that are tight.
Scott Gruber: Got it. And how do we think about what should be a normalized margin in D&E just given the shift towards more onshore work as we start this next up cycle and what appears to be more bundling, more turnkey contracts, how do we think about what normal on the D&E side of the business which is more international? And when can we get there given the contract roll schedule?
Jeff Miller: Look, I’m not going to call that right now. I’m really excited about where we’re going in that space in terms of differentiated equipment and I talked about Sperry but I’d also talk about our other service lines in D&E, excited about all of those. We’ve made a lot of gains over the last several years in terms of open hole and deepwater technology around drilling fluids is fantastic and growing. And so I feel like those margins will continue to expand as we see sort of tightness appear around the world internationally. Those tend to be more heavily weighted internationally just because that’s where more of the drilling activity is on a relative basis in North America. The actual drilling of a well is a smaller part of the overall ticket than the completion.
Scott Gruber: Got it. I appreciate it.
Jeff Miller: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Waqar Syed: Thank you. Jeff, in early February you had guided down to like $0.10 impact to the quarter from sand-related issues. In hindsight, do you still feel that the impact was $0.10 during the quarter or was it less or more?
Chris Weber: Waqar, this is Chris. It was generally in line with what we thought it was going to be and we felt good with regards to the outlook that we provided and delivering on that. When you step back – we were the first to actually see this problem and get our arms around it. We’re able to provide an update to the market and more importantly be able to start executing on the solution as it relates to working through the logistics constraints and minimizing disruption for our customers. And then when you think about our expectations for exiting the first quarter in a strong position and delivering on that, this all for the most part played out like we thought it was going to.
Waqar Syed: So that would be somewhere around – if I estimate it, around $600 million, $700 million of revenue impact, is that fair?
Chris Weber: From a revenue impact, I wouldn’t want to comment. We talked about from $0.10 perspective. I think we were generally in that range. And so I think – and that’s what I focus on.
Jeff Miller: It’s not just the days that we were slowed down but in addition to that it’s the response to those things which involves spot buying of very expensive sand, trucking things that ought to be railed. It’s a long – number of things that play into that response that served to impact margins.
Waqar Syed: Okay. So it’s more – a lot more cost issue and then some revenue impact, okay, that’s fair. And that’s probably my question but on the international side your revenue growth year-over-year was much better than what you’ve seen for the competitors. Now you’re guiding to kind of more flattish kind of international revenues in the second quarter. So was this just like an anomaly in 1Q or you think there was some market share gains underneath that?
Jeff Miller: No. I think that we’re well positioned to continue to grow. Q1 is always down relative to Q4. Q2, it’s following the same trajectory or curve that we’ve seen sort of year-upon-year-upon-year. So I don’t expect to see any changes there and expect to see continued outperformance or market share performance as we move into the next cycle. What’s important is how well we’re positioned internationally and I think that’s the change then until now. We made a lot of investment back in '12, '13 to be better positioned internationally. I love where we are competing in every market. So I expect we’ll perform very well into the next cycle.
Waqar Syed: And just one final question in terms of sand intensity per well, what are you seeing from your customers in the U.S.?
Jeff Miller: Yes, I would say that we are continuing to see sort of that flattish kind of activity. It’s not wildly up, wildly down. Again, as I’ve said before, sands one of those things we clearly want to optimize over time. It’s certainly a cost but at the same time as companies figure out how to best complete wells, better design completions, sand can move up for a time. And then they sort of define the limits of up and down – of high and low. They tend to find some places most effective in the middle.
Waqar Syed: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Dan Boyd: Thanks. Jeff, you mentioned internationally there are a number of markets or pockets that are stronger than others. So is the organization right-sized for that recovery or are you still spending to reallocate resources and is there an opportunity to maybe reallocate resources to those pockets of strength?
Jeff Miller: We’re going to manage our cost structure pretty tightly as we go into the next cycle. Our value proposition is that we collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. Our planning is in place to execute that strategy. And if we deploy resources, they’ll be more focused on executing the work but the key is to maintain the efficiencies that we develop through the downturn and make sure that’s part of whatever that ramp looks like going into the second half of this year and '19.
Chris Weber: And we take a global view of our equipment and tools and where they are, so we’re going to allocate where we think we see the demand assuming it’s cost effective to move in there. So definitely take a global perspective as it relates to our equipment allocation.
Dan Boyd: Okay. And then the follow up there is just on pricing. On the last call you said that international pricing was possible later in '18 and it sounds like now you’re more definitively pushing that into 2019, a lot of that sort of driven based on these pockets of strength. But what’s changed that is giving you less confidence in pricing this year?
Jeff Miller: Look, nothing’s changed. I think it’s more about when you see that in the P&L, the reality is pricing in pockets as market tightens towards the end of this year, I suspect that we see the ability to move on price. But overall we’re going to still see working off of contracts that were either light last year or this year. And so when I talked about inflection, I don’t suspect you actually see much of that until we get into 2019.
Dan Boyd: Okay. But from a leading-edge perspective you think pricing could happen still this year?
Jeff Miller: It could happen later this year.
Dan Boyd: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Kurt Hallead: Thank you. Hi, good morning.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead: Jeff, just wanted to follow up on the comments you made about the challenges on the rail side and how that’s opening up opportunities to source for your customers and base in, let’s say, in the Permian and other places. It kind of seems like it’s kind of trading one logistical challenge for another logistical challenge, rails versus trucks. As you guys are going to think through the process and prepare for that shift, do you expect the truck dynamic to be less of an intensive challenge than the rails as you move into using this local sand?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think to start with, our logistics investment and our logistics team is terrific. And so we will work through whatever those challenges are as they appear. But I think some of the key building blocks are in place particularly around how we move sand on a local basis. I think the box technology gives us a lot of options around how to move sand in ways to be more effective with that. We’ve got a lot of different ideas that I won’t layout on this call for all the reasons you might imagine. But I’m really excited about that shift and I don’t think Northern White gets more focused on other parts of the country which again we’ve got terrific logistics infrastructure to deal with that. And I think it actually creates just new opportunities. Will there be congestion? Yes, there probably will. But at the same time it feels – I can see a path to how we manage that that’s exciting.
Kurt Hallead: Great. That’s good color. And maybe on a quick follow up on that, how are things progressing in context of contracts for E&Ps relating to the local sand? And I don’t know about the best way, maybe you can provide us some color without getting too specific for competitive reasons, but how much adoption have you started to see and how much do you have already kind of committed to go to customers for local sand going into late '18 and '19?
Jeff Miller: Look, Kurt, we’re going to participate in that market. I think that our value proposition – when we view that market, things that bring the structural costs down are good for our business, all of our business including our customers, including Halliburton. And so we look at that as an opportunity to reduce the cost of this which actually allows our customers to do more work and do more of the work that I think is differential for Halliburton which is how to design and place fracs in a way that makes better well and does it more efficiently. So real excited about that. It’s going to probably be more adopted as it becomes more available and clearly everything would indicate that there will be a lot of availability of that sand as we work through the balance of 2018, certainly into '19.
Kurt Hallead: Got it. Thanks. And then just one more follow up just on the international front. You guys referenced pickup in activity, the prospect for better pricing into '19. So it seems to me that some of these contracts that had been I guess awarded here recently, it looks like they contrast sharply to other market periods where they were maybe two or three-year contracts and kind of were a drag on margins for an extended period of time. So am I understanding the dynamics, so you had much more shorter duration contracts in your international market and therefore you’ll start to get better margins in '19 and '20, is that how things are progressing?
Jeff Miller: Well, I would say it’s certainly smaller and shorter as we worked into the downturn, and at least at this point in time feel somewhat shorter. Clearly we prefer that just so that we got the ability to flex around equipment as time moves on. Obviously there will be a mixed bag of contract both duration and prices. We worked through this. But I think the short answer is certainly up until this point we’ve tended to see shorter duration contracts.
Kurt Hallead: That’s great. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: That concludes today’s question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the call back to Mr. Miller for any closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Liz. Before we close, I’d like to just highlight a couple of key takeaways. First, I’m excited about the outlook for North America and our March exit margins clearly demonstrate our path to normalized margins. And secondly, I’m pleased to see the recovery trajectory in the international markets demonstrated by the increase in tender activity and believe that this will lead to pricing inflection in 2019. So I look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Liz, you may now close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Lance, and good morning everyone. Outstanding execution resulted in an excellent fourth quarter and we are in a strong position to take care of opportunities presented by a growing North America market and improving international conditions. 2017 was a dynamic year for the oil and gas sector that marked another step on the road to recovery for our industry. I am pleased with the way our Halliburton team executed our value proposition, maintained strong service quality, generated superior results and industry leading returns. I’d like to thank the outstanding employees of Halliburton for their hard work and focus the entire year and for tremendous fourth quarter. I am very excited about the way 2018 is shaping up. Commodity prices have moved up. North America unconventional activity should be very busy, international markets are starting to show signs of life and our value proposition is resonating with our customers. I will address each of these in a few minutes. But first, I want to recap the highlights for the full year and fourth quarter. During the course of 2017, we grew our market share, generated industry-leading returns and outperformed our peers across every region. We accomplished this by aligning with customers in the fastest growing market segments and collaborating in engineering solutions to maximize their asset value. Total Company revenue grew 30% and adjusted operating income tripled, finishing the year with total Company revenue of $20.6 billion and adjusted operating income of $2 billion. In North America, we told you, we would win the recovery and we did. We recognized the changing market before anyone else, moved more quickly to reactive equipment, maintained historically high market share, raised prices and captured key customers before others could, a pretty tough task to pull off and we did it. Our international business began to show signs of recovery in the latter half of the year, driven primarily by improved performance in the Middle East, the North Sea and Latin America. And finally, we generated approximately $2.5 billion in operating cash flow and retired $1.4 billion in debt. And now, a few highlights for the fourth quarter. We finished the quarter with total Company revenue of $5.9 billion and adjusted operating income of $764 million, representing a sequential increase of 9% and 21%, respectively. Our Drilling and Evaluation division delivered a strong quarter, achieving nearly 50% incrementals, reflecting improved drilling activity in multiple regions and year-end software sales. As I've said many times before, we are way more than a completions company. Our Completion and Production division revenue grew 8% sequentially, once again outperforming the change in the average U.S. land rig count. And we increased our cash position by $440 million in the fourth quarter, demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline and efficient working capital management. This quarter demonstrates the strength and diversity of our portfolio. We have the leading position in hydraulic fracturing, which is clearly important. However, the results this quarter demonstrate the value of Halliburton's position as a multidisciplinary, integrated service provider with industry leading cementing, completion tools, drilling fluids, drill bits and software product lines, and much improved positions in artificial lift, directional drilling and wireline. Geographic diversity is also a key component of our strategy and our international business proved resilient. Middle East activity was consistent throughout 2017 in areas like the North Sea and Brazil that come on strong in the second half of the year. Our geographic diversity provided stability through the cycle and rounded out this quarter's excellent results. In the fourth quarter, our Completion and Production division margins were impacted by two expected transitory headwinds in North America, seasonality and cost inflation. As we expected, year-end presented some spotty activity caused by holiday schedules, weather and exhausted customer budgets. The frac calendar remained full due to the tightness in the overall market, but it came at a higher cost due to the increased idle time and mobilization required between jobs. I would rather serve our customers and capture revenue with temporarily lower margins than I would like as opposed to losing the revenue entirely. That is what our world-class business development organization allows us to do. During the fourth quarter, we also saw cost inflation in sand and trucking. The price of sand escalated over the last few months of 2017, but I believe that increasing sand capacity, particularly from localized mines combined with our supply chain strategy will reduce the cost throughout 2018. Trucking is tight across North America and is particularly tight in areas like the Permian where activity is strong and locations are remote. We believe our increasing use of containerized sand will help mitigate trucking inflation by reducing the required trucks per well site and demurrage. Now, these headwinds were anticipated, are transitory, and are not a surprise at this point in the cycle. Now, let's talk about 2018. To remove any doubt, I am confident that we will achieve our normalized margin goals and here is why. As I've said before, we have three levers to pull in order to achieve normalized margins and they’re working. All three levers are important and the great thing about Halliburton’s scope and scale is that we have the ability to pull them all in a meaningful way. Halliburton is the execution company. We are going to pull these levers to get to our normalized margins. The first lever is pricing. North America completions market remains tight and we are sold out. Therefore, we continue to push pricing across our portfolio. Improving oil price and demand for equipment provides runway for us to continue to increase our pricing through the first half of the year. The second lever is utilization. Equipment utilization is very impactful for a Company of our size. We continue to place our equipment with those customers who know how to effectively and efficiently use us to increase their productivity, which improves our utilization. I can tell you that customers rapidly returned to work after the holidays and we expect improved utilization to drive margin growth. Finally, the third lever is technology that reduces cost and increases efficiency and production. We use our continuous improvement initiatives to focus on designing technology that meets market demand and reduces costs for ourselves and our customers. A great example of this is Snapshot, our digital tracking and analytic system for our hydraulic fracturing equipment. With Snapshot, we can assess what every piece of equipment is doing every moment of the day. This big data application allows us to optimize operations to reduce downtime, minimize maintenance and compare the efficiency of completion designs. We’re able to compare operations across basins and countries to get optimal results from our fleets. These levers, combined with superior service quality, allowed us to triple our margins in C&P since the fourth quarter of 2016. I believe the effort, economics and enthusiasm that I see today, puts Halliburton well along the path to 20% margins in 2018. Now, let’s talk about new builds for a minute. We have a set criterion, it is return driven, and we follow that criterion. That criterion was met in the fourth quarter and we delivered a handful of spreads to the market. This additional equipment along with our existing equipment maintained market share, improved our margins, and generated industry-leading returns. So, let’s get some perspective. We still have less equipment in the field than we did at our peak in 2014. You know I’m committed to leading returns. We build our own equipment, we manufacture faster, cheaper and with less lead time. Most importantly, this allows me to make discrete decisions, and I’ll do it through the prism of achieving leading returns. You trusted me to do this in the fourth quarter, you got leading industry returns. My plan is to do this going forward. Bottom-line is, I’m excited about 2018. The supply and demand dynamic is correcting and commodity prices are improving, supporting activity around the globe. Our strategy resonates with our customers. This helped us navigate the downturn and more importantly, positioned us to win a recovery domestically and abroad. I believe that the U.S. land market will be very busy in 2018 and that demand for horsepower will continue to grow. Rigs continue to get more efficient, but more importantly, completions intensity continues to grow with longer laterals and tighter spacing. As a result, I believe that the rig count to frac spread ratio has narrowed such that today, this ratio is nearly 2 to 1. Think about that for a minute. It's gone from 4 to 1 to 2 to 1 in four years. Tightening rig to spread metrics, ignore the impact of increased wear and tear on equipment, there is no doubt that today's industry horsepower is working harder than ever before and that the pace of degradation is increasing on active equipment. The impact of wear and tear on the working fleet is demonstrated by the industry's rise and average horsepower per crew. Today, the industry is forced to employ redundancy measures to mitigate non-productive time on the well site. We know this is happening because we see, customers pushing our competitors to bring spreads of 45,000 to 50,000 horsepower to a job while Halliburton remains at 36,000. As a result of drilling efficiency, completions intensity and equipment degradation, I am confident the market will remain tight in 2018. We're using local sand with a few customers in the Permian and I believe this will become an increasing trend as additional capacity is activated. Therefore, sand cost should go down in 2018 as regional sand mines come on line and capacity is increased. We have contracted with multiple suppliers to optimize our value proposition and maximize our logistics plan in areas where local sand makes sense. This will not happen overnight, but we are working with our customers and suppliers to ensure that we can provide desired profit at a reasonable cost. As for the international markets, I am encouraged for the first time in three years. Green shoots are appearing in the form of more tender activity and constructive conversations with customers. It's great to hear the change of tone in our discussions with our customers and to be able to work collaboratively with them to create solutions that overcome the challenging economics. While we expect activity to gradually improve throughout the year, an overcapitalized market, pricing pressure and concessions that have been given throughout the cycle, need to be unwind. As a result, I believe the market will improve this year, but the recovery will be choppy. Our strategy is working and winning. A recent example is our contract award with Aker BP in North Sea. This win demonstrates the power of our value proposition and the strength of the people in this organization. We listened to what the customer wanted and collaborated together to create a business model that aligned incentives between the operator and its service providers. This five-year contract for well construction services will showcase our drilling and digital technology. Under the agreement, we execute integrated operations in the three-party collaboration with the operator and the rig contractor without owning a rig or taking on reservoir risk. We take on execution risk, but as the execution company, we welcome this risk and believe this agreement is a win-win for all parties. Throughout the downturn and during the recovery, we invested in new technologies that provide value to our customers and growth opportunities in new markets. Our wireline business is a great example. We broadened our capabilities and developed industry-leading services for formation, evaluation and well intervention. We saw positive results from this investment last year with solid market share gains including some key wins in the Middle East and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. I am pleased with the progress we’ve made in this product service line and we plan to continue to invest and expand this business. In wireline, we are listening to our customers and responding with technology and solutions to meet their needs and expand our business. We’re doing the same thing with our recently acquired Summit ESP business. Overall, our effective, clear and sustainable strategy combined with market momentum and our dedicated employees give me confidence that Halliburton is best positioned for the year ahead. We are the execution company. We will provide superior, technology and service quality for our customers, and this will result in industry leading returns and positive cash flow for our shareholders. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Chris for a financial update.
Chris Weber: Thanks, Jeff. Let’s start with the summary of our fourth quarter results compared sequentially to the third quarter. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.9 billion and adjusted operating income was $764 million, representing a sequential increase of 9% and 21%, respectively. These results were primarily driven by increased global drilling activity and end of year software and product sales. Moving to our division results. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased by 12%, operating income increased 62% and operating margins improved by 420 basis points. These increases were primarily due to year-end software sales, which were stronger than expected and increased drilling activity in the Middle East, Brazil and North America. In our Completion and Production division, fourth quarter revenue increased by 8%, operating income increased by 5% and operating margin was generally flat. Revenues were up primarily due to improved pressure pumping activity and pricing in U.S. land, completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Latin America, and increased stimulation activity in the Eastern Hemisphere. The operating margin was impacted by the seasonality and cost inflation headwinds that just Jeff described. In North America, revenue increased by 7%, primarily driven by increased utilization and pricing throughout the United States land sector in the majority of our product service lines, primarily pressure pumping as well as higher drilling activity and completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin America revenue increased by 16%, primarily driven by increased drilling activity and software sales in Brazil, as well as higher software sales in Mexico and increased stimulation activity in Argentina; these results were partially offset by reduced drilling activity in Venezuela. Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, we saw revenue grow by 7%, primarily due to improved drilling activity in the North Sea coupled with increased activity in Algeria and Egypt. These results were partially offset by a reduction in completion tool sales in Nigeria. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue increased by 12%. These results were primarily driven by increased drilling and stimulation activity in the Middle East and year-end sales in China. Regarding Venezuela, we continue to experience delays in collecting payments on receivables from our primary customer. These delayed payments combined with recent credit rating downgrades and deteriorating market conditions required us to record an aggregate charge of $385 million under GAAP. This charge represents a fair market value adjustment on our existing promissory note, and a full reserve against our other accounts receivables with this customer. In addition, we will no longer accrete the value of our promissory note beginning in 2018. We actively manage our strategic relationship with this customer and we will continue to vigorously pursue collections as we do business going forward. In the fourth quarter, our corporate and other expense totaled $79 million, which was slightly higher than anticipated as a result of an environmental charge. For the first quarter of 2018, we anticipate that our corporate expenses will be approximately $70 million. Net interest expense for the quarter was $115 million, in line with our guidance. For the first quarter of 2018, we expect our net interest expense to be approximately $140 million as we will no longer accrete the value of our promissory note in Venezuela. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter excluding tax reform and Venezuela-related charges came in at approximately 27%. In December, the President signed a comprehensive tax reform bill. That among other things lowered the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and moved the country towards a territorial tax system. For Halliburton, this tax reform bill is a big positive. We expect it to lower our effective tax rate percentage from the high-20s to the 21% to 23% range, reflecting the new U.S. corporate rate plus state and local taxes along with our geographic earnings mix. The lower effective tax rate will positively impact our future earnings and help level the playing field with our foreign domicile competitors. During the fourth quarter, we recorded an $882 million non-cash charge, primarily as a result of a preliminary provision for the net impact of tax reform. As I mentioned, this is a non-cash charge. Given our current U.S. tax attributes, we do not expect to pay any cash tax on our deemed repatriation tax obligations. We expect our 2018 full year and first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 23% based on our expected geographic earnings mix. Turning to cash flow. We generated approximately $440 million of cash in the quarter, improving our cash position at year-end to $2.4 billion. The increase in cash was primarily due to strong cash flows from operations, which included working capital improvements, and continued disciplined capital spending. Our 2017 CapEx came in at approximately $1.4 billion, slightly below our depreciation and amortization expense of $1.5 billion. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately in line with our depreciation and amortization expense in 2018. This CapEx guidance includes deployment of new Sperry Drilling tools and the continued investment in our artificial lift and production chemical product lines and industry-leading pressure pumping fleet. Given the current operating strength of our business and the favorable outlook just described earlier, we are actively evaluating our options around usage of cash, which could include debt retirement, funding acquisitions and organic growth projects or return of capital to shareholders. Now, turning to the first quarter. Our 10-year historical average for adjusted earnings per share from the fourth to the first quarter is a decline of 16%. Because of improving North America land operations, we believe it will be about half that in the first quarter. Let me turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments. 
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Chris. Let me sump it up. I’m really happy with our 2017 results. They reflect our successful strategy and execution and put Halliburton in a great position. I’m excited about what I see for Halliburton in 2018. The macro is self-correcting. Commodity prices have improved. Unconventional activity is strong. The international markets are recovering. We expect to generate significant cash flow. Our value proposition is resonating with customers. And all of this together will continue to result in industry-leading returns. Now, let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. 
Jim Wicklund: Good morning, guys. Good quarter, that needs to be said. This quarter that as we said. My question instead of dealing with domestic really is about international. We all talked last year about how the rig count probably bottomed in the middle of the year but pricing was difficult. Jeff, you mentioned that it started to improve a little bit in the second half. Can you talk about how far concessions and pricing went down and what’s going on with pricing internationally now?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, Jim. We’re in every market around the world, so we have great visibility into that. And the short answer is there still a lot of pressure. When I describe green shoots, I’m talking about activity. But that activity is spread thinly. A lot of capital available in the marketplace, and because activity is spread thinly, it doesn’t create the kind of tightness for a price inflection. And then, the concessions given were significant and in some ways continuing into 2018, some of those haven’t even been implemented. So, look, trust me, my tone is changed and I see price inflection, but I don’t think it’s until later 2018 and certainly we will see it in 2019.
Jim Wicklund: And just continuing on that, I know you had talked last year about the hope and expectation that we would get to normalized margins in the U.S. market and you made that comment again that you expect to get there in 2018 for domestic. When do we hit normalized margins over the next couple of years in the international sector? I know that’s a big crystal ball question, Jeff. But I mean, just in general, how many years do you think it will take before we reach the level that we’re getting to in 2018?
Jeff Miller: I think it’s not this year, it’s not probably 2019. It takes -- that ramp is slower, Jim, because of contractual nature of the market and it’s really driven off of, first and foremost, tightness in the U.S. But, what we are seeing is I think the kind of commodity price support that will build that confidence with our customers, which will then create the tightness, which then creates the path back. And so, and I guess, my last comment on that, I think our value proposition is perfectly suited to drive back towards those normalized international margins, because we are so focused on maximizing asset value. And I think quite frankly that paradigm will continue.
Jim Wicklund: Well, I'd rather see a staged recovery, first domestic and then international that last a couple of years than everything peaking at the same time. And that sure doesn't look like going to happen. Jeff, thank you very much. I appreciate it, guys.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Jim. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
James West: Hey, good morning guys and great quarter.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, James.
James West: So, I want to continue on international side, because clearly North America is going to be great this year and I'll let others talk in detail about that. But, on the international recovery that you are discussing, I know we talked about some seasonality of course in 1Q, but how should -- and I know you talked about uneven, but how should we think about one kind of the timing of those green shoots starting to show up in revenue? And then, I guess, two, which markets, which geographic markets are you say more excited about?
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks. So, I think that that progression is ratable as how I would describe that. I think, we see growing confidence and added rigs sort of progressively through 2018, obviously with some inflection coming later in those stages, as I've said. But, I don't see it as a spike. It's a confidence building and we grow into that activity. But, what I’m most excited about internationally would certainly be North Sea. I think that's a market that's going to have legs in 2018 and we'll see activity growing there. And we're certainly excited about how we're positioned there, clearly excited about I think Middle East broadly. Again, I think we'll continue to be resilient and will have some pockets of better activity.
James West: Okay. And then, I believe over the last kind of two or so upturns, you've built out the international infrastructure for Halliburton. You have most of -- you deployed most of the capital I think that you probably need to; you’ve got the market share that supports that cost structure. Although, you always want more, I get that. But, it seems to me like, and correct me if I'm wrong, but you don’t really need to deploy a lot of capital. This is more of a let's just soak in the revenue when it comes and get very good incremental margins or cash on cash returns as the cycle takes off internationally, is that fair?
Jeff Miller: Yes. That is fair, James. I mean, look, we're very excited about that franchise. And I've said that throughout even the downturn that investment that we made four years ago, five years ago and building out that footprint that is a valuable piece of franchise. And yes, capital is largely in place to execute on that. And that should be a very good business for us.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.
Angie Sedita: So, Jeff, turning back to the U.S. a little bit. When you think about the market in 2018, just industry wide, have you done any work or any thoughts on how much newbuild equipment to be coming into the market in 2018 from the industry? And how much newbuild equipment could come in where you think it would be a concern as far as tampering or dampening the outlook for pricing?
Jeff Miller: Well, Angie, I think, the activity in the market -- the market to start with is undersupplied. We’re well aware of what’s in the marketplace today and/or that’s going. And everything I see given the increasing intensity in completions, actually the drawing in of that ratio of rigs to spreads, which from 4 to 1 to 2 to 1, which really is an example of what that intensity looks like gives me a lot of confidence that it stays tight. And that metric I’m talking about doesn’t take into account wear and tear on equipment, which I think we’ve demonstrated is quite real, certainly through the downturn as we look at equipment that never came back in the market and the way that it’s working right now.
Angie Sedita: And then, in 2017, it really was a big focus on your legacy equipment and where we stand today, how much of that equipment is still beneath the market as far as the spot, and thoughts on timing there?
Jeff Miller: Well, I think from my perspective that has -- I said, originally that would take about four quarters and it’s taken about four quarters for things to turn over. So, as we look ahead, we’ve got a lot of ability to move -- because of the tightness, opportunities with pricing as we go into 2018. In fact, I’m quite confident that we’ll see all three of our levers executed that being price, utilization and technology.
Operator: And the next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Jud Bailey: I wanted to ask for -- maybe we could get a little more color on how to think about margin progression for both C&P and D&E, both for the first quarter and just thinking about the rest of the year. I know, internationally, we’ll have a pullback seasonally, but it also sounds like in the North America, you still expect to get the normalized margins. You had some seasonality, which impacted you in the fourth quarter. So just trying to think about progression for both of those businesses for the next few quarters. If you could put some color around that would be great.
Chris Weber: I mean, in line with our guidance, I mean, expect Q4 to be down. You’ve got the typical benefit of year-end product sales in the fourth quarter and seasonal pullback in activity in the first quarter in certain international markets. But going forward, looking at C&P very much in line with what Jeff said, normalized margin target is still there and we’re working towards it. And for us to be able to do that, C&P is going to have to be a big driver of that, and so, very much committed to achieving that sometime in 2018.
Jud Bailey: Okay. But I guess, it’s fair to think that if you were to hit normalized margins, you’d probably do it before, certainly before the fourth quarter, given the seasonality impact. So, you’d hit it during the one of the high points of your typical -- your best two quarters or typically the second, third quarter. Is that a fair way to think about it though?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean, we certainly are confident we get there. And yes, it starts with customer urgency, which we see; it starts with -- the second component of that is to be sold out, which we are. So, those two give me a lot of confidence around our ability to move on price. And to deliver, when we deliver, to deliver the 20% normalized margins. Obviously, C&P division will be performing very, very well. D&E just to follow that up, D&E is solid business for us. And I talk about our franchise. We expect to see -- D&E has made consistent progress through the downturn, both in share and margin recovery. And so, I suspect that we continue with that also for the fullness of the year.
Jud Bailey: Got it. I appreciate that. And then, if I could ask -- just step back and ask you about international again. You've obviously -- you've highlighted last couple of quarters have been very strong. You're taking share as you noted. Could you maybe just give us a little more color on where do you like you've executed your international strategy the best, whether it would be product lines, regions? Maybe just give a little more comments, because your performance has been quite strong. And so, I would like to just get your thought on where you’re most pleased and where you're executing and then how you see the market in 2018? Thanks.
Jeff Miller: Well, look, for us it all starts with our value proposition which is to collaborating engineered solutions and maximize asset value for our customers. But, if we think about that like a platform and then we add superior assets to that, then, our team is very effective at delivering integrated solutions where it’s a project management type outcome, but also discrete solutions. And so, I'm very pleased with clearly what we've done in the Middle East and what we've done in Brazil and all around the world. But, it really comes back to service quality, is fantastic and when we deliver that. All of our solutions are well-aligned with our customers. And that again takes a geographic view as well as a service line view, because we're aligned with maximizing asset value for our customers. And I think that's a key paradigm and the feature that we believe in and that's what we do.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.
Bill Herbert: Good morning. Chris, I assume that when we're speaking of your targeted 20% normalized margin, that's for North American C&P. And I'm just curious as to what the spread is right now between North American C&P margins and overall C&P Margins. In other words, what overall C&P margin do we have to hit over the course of 2018 for you to hit your, quote unquote, targeted normalized margins?
Chris Weber: Normalized margins obviously focus on North America. C&P is the biggest driver of North America results. And so, those are going to need to be in line.
Bill Herbert: Okay. So, basically, effect -- you say in line, so we would expect to hit an overall C&P margin to 20%?
Chris Weber: Then they’re going to need to be in line.
Bill Herbert: And what do you mean by that?
Chris Weber: In same ballpark. 
Jeff Miller: In think there are other components to that. I think we've described that as having -- it's got international activity and it has got various different things in it that comprise that. But, I think it's a good surrogate for what we see in North America.
Bill Herbert: Okay. That's great, Jeff. Thanks. And then, so, I -- different point is, we’ve had -- I mean, you explained it very candidly and very clearly with regard to some of the constraints in the fourth quarter in terms of margin in relation to revenue uplift in Q4 for C&P. If you're going to hit kind of a high teens or even 20% margin in 2018 for C&P, even taking into account the seasonality in Q1, then, you guys must have a pretty strong line of sight in terms of pricing realization, net pricing improvement over the course of 2018 in order for you guys to hit that margin because typically, you guys are pretty comprehensive and complete with regard to formulating your guidance.
Jeff Miller: Yes. That’s what we see. I think, again, I’d describe it in terms of levers, so price is an important part of that, but as is some of the other things.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And Jeff, you talked about the fact that you are sold out for the first half. Does your frac calendar -- is it starting to substantially populate for the second half of the year?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean, Bill, when I say foreseeable future, it’s kind of out as far as I can see. Now, it has limits in terms of where is that -- visibility perfect or not. But, yes, I’m confident that we have, works in 2018 and that’s why say, I am really excited about 20018.
Bill Herbert: And then, finally for me, we’ve got a sort of historically tight domestic labor market and an especially tight labor market in the Midland basin and other energy markets, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas as a whole. And the difference between the unemployment rates today versus where we were that kind of trough unemployment rates in 2008, 2014 is that we have a lot of runway for the growth and what looks to be a sustained increase call on U.S. production. How are you dealing with these labor constraints, given this tight market and what is expected to be even tighter going forward?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Bill, I trust in the strength and sophistication of our HR organization. We’re the biggest service company in North America and that means we operate the business. I think we operate it across the entirety of the U.S. though as you say some markets are tighter than others. But, we’re able to recruit and even non-traditional -- clearly recruit in non-traditional oilfield markets as well. And these are really good jobs in the oilfield. And so, we mitigate the labor issues through the national recruiting effort. And it’s important to remember that this is the same human resources machine that hired 21,000 people in 2014. So, I’m confident that we find the people to do the work.
Operator: And our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Scott Gruber: Jeff, just following on the normalized margining question for C&P. How do you think about normalized margins in the D&E segment? I realize it will take a longer to get there given the international exposure, but roughly where would you peg those at in the new environment, but after all your share gain?
Jeff Miller: Look, I see them in the same ballpark just over maybe a different timeframe. But certainly, I mean, those businesses are substantial; they’ve got great value propositions, they have grown share, delivering terrific results as well. I think about for example, I could pick on individual technologies, but it is BaraShale Lite for example, a fantastic breakthrough and fluids technology that does two things. It actually improves efficiency and it’s just a better solution. So, we’ve got a number of those and those are the kind of things that as they get rolled out, move margins up, it takes share to start with though. 
Scott Gruber: And then, Jeff, you had positive commentary on pricing during your remarks, typically investors to take that and interpret it as positive pricing for frac. But, we're also hearing about positive traction across a lot of the minor product lines in the U.S. today. Can you put some color on the pricing trends you're seeing in cements, wireline, directional coil? You have underappreciated exposure I think to some of these product lines. So some color here would be great. And do you actually see greater pricing traction in these wirelines versus frac or is about on par today?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think, you see all of that to a degree moving together. We'd always said that, those didn't fall. Other service lines didn’t fall as faster as far as frac. And so, the comeback would be less dramatic and pronounced than frac. But clearly, there is a flight to quality around those other service lines as well. And we do have pricing traction in those other service lines.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open.
David Anderson: Good morning, Jeff. So, E&P capital discipline has been one of the themes we've been hearing about quite a bit. I was wondering if you could give us your take on how you think E&P behavior is changing or could change with this cycle? Kind of hearing some of the E&Ps are talking about trimming some of their rig counts but they're selling to using some lower pricing. Can you give us your sense of what your conversations are like right now as we kind of start with 2018 and kind of how you think E&P behavior could change?
Jeff Miller: Yes, great question. And look, we listen to our customers. And because we listen and don't lecture, we understand the message that they get from their shareholders. And there are many different customers with many different strategies. Clearly, there is a group that's interested in generating more cash and being more disciplined. There is another group that has acreage that they absolutely want to prove up and their stakeholders want them to do that. And so, I think you can't think North America was a single brush certainly in that regard. But, what I can tell you is that those sets of customers are going to be working and busy in 2018, and I expect busier in 2018 than they were in 2017.
David Anderson: And then perhaps we can go back to on the capacity side, you made a few comparisons with 2014. And perhaps maybe one comparison I’m very interested in is how you think about the useful life of your frac equipment in 2014 versus today. And then, within that context with the amount of capacity that’s coming on in 2018, do you have a sense as to how much do you think needs to replaced for attrition? We've heard various numbers, I was curious your take as to what do you think that attrition number is?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I think I'll start with attrition. And I think attrition is a real dynamic, though it may take the form -- I used the degradation on the call this quarter, just because in many cases what happens it become too expensive to bring back. But, there is a quite a bit of cost associated I think for the industry in terms of keeping that equipment in the marketplace. So, that's a real number, but it's difficult to give you a number on that though it drove -- if you try to look at what was in the market before the downturn, what did make it back out for the downturn I think is indicative of sort of the pace of degradation or attrition that happens. But, the market today clearly is undersupplied in our view. And, I think you ask about increased intensity or more stage counts and longer later is going to drive more wear and tear on equipment, which is simply the number of reps. When I compare it to 2014, I am more confident just because we've increased or we’ve deepened the amount of Q10 technology we have in the market which consistently bears up better to that kind of stress, ergo the reason we’re able to execute with less horsepower on location than what we see in the market.
Operator: And the next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Waqar Syed: First for Jeff, in the past, you’ve given numbers on how the frac sand intensity per well has been changing, any updates on that?
Jeff Miller: No, Waqar. I mean, it’s just kind of down the middle. I would describe -- that dynamic is really what I think optimization looks like. And so, we will keep an eye on that, but we haven’t seen a lot of change in the last quarter.
Waqar Syed: And then, at our energy conference in early January, many of E&P remarked that they were seeing broad based service price inflations in the range of 5% to 15% in the U.S. Now, would you agree with that kind of range or do you think that that number still underestimates maybe what the price inflation could be in 2018?
Jeff Miller: I think that underestimates it. But, I’m not going to call on where we see pricing. That’s certainly competitive for us and I think it’s also a function of where you are in the marketplace. Where you start, drives what that percentage is. But, nevertheless, tightness and urgency, which all of this begins with customer urgency, which clearly we see today is the support for that price.
Waqar Syed: And then, just one final question. You mentioned about stimulation business picking up outside of the U.S. as well. I can see it in Argentina and maybe Saudi. Are there any other market as well, where the stimulation business is increasing internationally?
Jeff Miller: Look, primary activity being as we’ve always said Argentina from an unconventional perspective has the kind of rocks and the beginnings of infrastructure that make that, we’re very excited about that. We’ve got solid pumping businesses in a number of markets around the world that we’re excited about. And I’m always also excited about the ability to apply multi-staged frac to tight reservoirs and what have been sort of historically under-produced reservoirs. So, you see those in a few other countries around the world and also in some offshore markets where we create value.
Operator: And the next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Sean Meakim: In the prepared comments, I don’t think I caught a CapEx budget for 2018. So, maybe you could just give us a sense on what your spend is going to look like this year and maybe what kind of flex there could be in North America depending on what the market gives you?
Chris Weber: Yes. So, we -- right now, we said in the call that 2018 CapEx would be in line with D&A. We think D&A is going to be around $1.6 billion in 2018. 
Sean Meakim: And then, just one more point of clarification. On the one key you guided, you talked about half of sequential drop you’ve experienced historically just given the faster start in North America. Was that an earnings-before-taxes comment or was that EPS, just curious how tax reform impacts the sequential change there as well?
Chris Weber: Yes. That’s EPS. And obviously, tax reform does impact, but don’t forget, we have the -- we’re losing that interest accretion on the promissory note in Venezuela. So that’s why we guided to the higher net interest expense in the first quarter. Those could -- it's going to be a push.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Timna Tanners: I would follow up if I could on Chris's comments about being actively evaluating options to use cash. Just, I'm not expecting you to lay it all for us, but to the extent possible if you can give us any thoughts on timing, order of preference and where you'd like to see some of your debt metrics going forward. Thanks.
Chris Weber: Yes. So, we've discussed before, we’ve got that $400 million maturity coming due in August this year and we intend to retire that. After that we’re going to -- everything is really looked at through the returns lens. And we'll think about where we could deploy capital with regards to growing the business, where we can generate those leading returns. And if we don't have opportunity to present themselves there, we'll look at returning it to shareholders, both considering share buyback and dividends.
Jeff Miller: Timna, I'm glad to be talking about that again.
Timna Tanners: This is a good point. Do you have a sense of your timing, can you just talk about is there an urgency there, are you content to wait and look at opportunities, is the M&A market particularly attractive versus organic opportunities?
Chris Weber: I wouldn’t say it’s urgent, it’s something -- like Jeff said, we're excited to be having that be the dialogue, further dialogue internally and thinking about when and what the right timing is. And so, we think that's a great reflection of where we are from a cycle recovery perspective. And so, you’d also ask just about kind of where we'd like to see debt metrics and we talked about this before. But mid-30s debt to cap, and we want that -- our debt-to-EBITDA to be under 2.5 times.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Chase Mulvehill: Hey. Good morning, Jeff. Quick question for Chris. When we think about free cash flow conversion over the next few years, if I kind of look at 2018, it looks like your free cash flow conversion versus kind of net income, based on your CapEx guidance is going to be about 80%. As we think about going forward, is that a fair number when we think about free cash flow conversion?
Chris Weber: Yes. What we said is that we expect to achieve a free cash flow conversion kind of in line or greater than peers. And so, that's what we're working towards. And that largely comes through capital discipline. Obviously if the market is ripping and we see lots of opportunities to put capital to work at great returns, we'll have to look at that. But, in a sustaining market environment, free cash flow conversion, in line or better than peers is what we're shooting for.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. 
Chris Weber: And we had great results in 2017 on that. We were about 120% free cash flow conversion in 2017.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay, great. And then thinking about where the pressure pumping horsepower demand is today in U.S. onshore, maybe if you want to take a stab -- at that, and just kind of how undersupplied do you think the market is today?
Jeff Miller: Look, I think it's undersupplied. Clearly, we've estimated 1.5 million horsepower probably somewhere like that. And what continues to keep it there is the degradation on equipment and the intensity growing around completions. And that's meaningful and that's longer laterals, that's more stages; in some cases more sand, in some cases less; but in either case, simply more activity driving the demand. And then to that point, the flight to quality that we see towards our assets, our platform and approach to work, I’m very confident and excited about 2018.
Chase Mulvehill: And how much share have you been able to hold through the recovery? Have you been able to kind of maintain, kind of peak of share, have you given some of that back?
Jeff Miller: Look, we said all along, we reached sort of the highest share we’ve ever had as we worked through the downturn. And our intent had been to settle at a higher than our historical share through the recovery, and that’s what we’ve done.
Operator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for any closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Candice. Before we close up, I’d like to just reinforce a couple of key points. First, I’m excited about what I see for Halliburton in 2018. The commodity prices have improved and unconventional activity is strong. And finally, we expect to generate significant cash flows and industry-leading returns. So, I look forward talking to you next quarter. Candice, you can close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Lance, and good morning everyone. Overall, we had a fantastic quarter and I’m very pleased with our results. We are hitting on all cylinders just like we said we would and this quarter’s performance is another example of why Halliburton is the execution company. Here are few highlights from the third quarter. Total company revenue was $5.4 billion, representing a 10% increase compared to our second quarter results, and we generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow. Once again, we outgrew our peers on a global basis showing that we are taking global market share. Our North American revenue increased by 14%, significantly outpacing the average sequential U.S. land rig count growth of 6%. Total operating income increased 55% to over $630 million, primarily driven by continued strengthening of market conditions in North America and improved profitability in our drilling and evaluation product lines. Our completion and production division revenue increased 13% with 215 basis points of margin expansion, despite the approximately 50 basis-point negative impact of Hurricane Harvey. The drilling and evaluation division revenue increased 4% while operating margins expanded by 260 basis points to approximately 9%, demonstrating solid execution in our international franchise. Finally, during the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Summit ESP, which is an important strategic step in building out our production oriented business lines and makes us the number two ESP provider in North America. In August, the Texas Gulf Coast was severely impacted by Hurricane Harvey and our fantastic employees worked closely together to support those in our organization and the entire community affected by the storm. As a result of the weather, we had a few customers temporarily suspend activity in both the Gulf of Mexico and the Eagle Ford. We also experienced increased costs because diesel fuel was temporarily unavailable and reduced deficiency due to sand supply chain disruptions, both of which negatively affected our margins for the quarter. In spite of these disruptions, the sophistication and hard work of our supply chain organization allowed us to quickly adapt to these challenges and continue to execute and deliver superior service quality. Let me take a moment and talk about a few things we said about North America in the second quarter call. We told you the rig count growth would plateau, and that’s exactly what it did. We said our North America sequential revenue would significantly outperform average U.S. land rig count growth, and it did. We told you that our completion and production margins would continue to expand, and they did. We said operators were beginning to optimize as opposed to maximize the use of sand and turn to technology to increase production; this trend held true as we saw average sand per well remain flat sequentially. And finally, we said we would have the highest returns in the industry, and we do as we continue to outgrow our peers and take market share. Now, let me spend some more time on each of these topics. During the quarter, the U.S. land rig count effectively flattened as customers reacted to shareholder input and their own view of market conditions for the balance of the year. However, our revenue increased and we saw improved activity in our completions related product lines due to the natural lag between drilling and completing wells. Today, the industry is drilling approximately the same footage as in 2014 with half the rigs while completions intensity has significantly increased. As the rig count stabilizes, our customers are focused on efficiencies, optimization and making more barrels. These are all things Halliburton does really well, differentiating us from our peers. And I’m pleased with the progress we’ve made this quarter towards normalized margins in North America. Our strategy is working. And as I said in the past, the path to normalized margins begins with customer urgency, and I still see that urgency today. We have three levers to achieve our margin goals. And they’re, one, increasing pricing; two, improving equipment utilization; and three, structurally reducing our costs. Increasing pricing is important, but it’s just one component we can leverage to reach our goal. Ultimately, we will utilize a combination of all three levers to return to normalized margins. All three levers are important, and the great thing about Halliburton’s scope and scale is that we have the ability to pull on them all in a meaningful way. And you know Halliburton is the execution company. We’re going to pull these levers as necessary to get to our normalized margins. The North America completions market remains tight and we continue to push pricing across our portfolio every day. Demand for our completions equipment and service quality remains strong. The improving oil price outlook provides runway for us to increase our portfolio pricing as we go forward. So, let me be clear; we still have the ability to push price. Equipment utilization comes in a couple of forms. First, it has to be working; and second, it has to be working for the right customers. Our fleet is sold out for the remainder of the year and into 2018. We continue to place our equipment with those customers who know how to effectively and efficiently use us to increase their productivity, which improves our utilization. As for reducing costs, we continue to remove unnecessary costs from our company. It’s also critical that we save costs and increase utilization through the use of technology. Our wellhead ExpressKinect unit is a perfect example. This equipment allows us to increase our utilization by switching wellheads faster and more safely when doing zipper-frac operations. As a result, we’re able to reduce the number of people on location and improve our equipment efficiency. Let’s now take a minute and talk about a few topics that I hear frequently debated in the market. The first is sand. During the third quarter, total sand volume for Halliburton continued to increase, but our average sand per well remained sequentially flat. Data points from the last two quarters and my discussions with customers indicate customers are focused on cost-effective production. They hear a lot of conflicting anecdotes about sand used today, because they are based on individual operators and individual basis. But the facts are, for Halliburton, sand per well was down in the Bakken, Rockies and Northeast, and it was up in the Permian Basin. This happened because customers that know the production characteristics of the reservoirs have streamlined their operations to focus on cost per barrel of oil equivalent and are optimizing sand utilization. Conversely, those customers that are still drilling the whole acreage or exploring production boundaries at their reservoirs are continuing the pump jobs with higher sand loads. At the end of the day, Halliburton benefits from both scenarios. The second topic is supply and demand for pressure pumping equipment. Now, first, let me be clear. I believe the market is undersupplied today. At the same time, equipment is being used harder and maintenance costs are higher. As a result, there will be a greater call for new equipment, just to replace the active equipment that’s being worn out more quickly, meaning the day when supply and demand come into balance is further out than people think. Now, I believe companies that are not making money will struggle to build new equipment beyond their current fleet, take or pay commitments, as they work with constraint budgets and struggle to find capital to fund further purchases. You see many announcements of new fleet deployments, but no announcement of fleet retirements. But, I can tell you, they are happening. Next, completions intensity is not slowing down. We are pumping more sand with less equipment, and as a result, the maintenance costs associated with today’s completion designs are increasing. The design of our equipment gives us an advantage over the market that even we have seen an increase in maintenance costs. I believe deferred maintenance is happening throughout the industry. A proxy for deferred maintenance and the simplest place to see it is in the industry and horsepower creeping crew size. Now, while Halliburton continues to operate with an average fleet size 36,000 horsepower per crew and have for the last several years, the rest of the industry is now averaging closer to 45,000 horsepower per crew. Deferred maintenance is creating this equipment redundancy on location. The bottom line is that Halliburton has the advantage to respond to customer demand by bringing less equipment to the well side and designing our equipment to require less maintenance cost. Building our equipment internally gives us the ability to respond quickly to market changes and to design our equipment to reduce the total cost of ownership. As a follow-up to that point, I said last quarter, I’d be crazy to talk about new build equipment in detail terms, and this remains the case. But, what I said has not changed. We are first and foremost a returns focused organization. And we will only bring out new build equipment under certain conditions. And those conditions are, one, backed by customer commitment; two, captures leading-edge pricing, which is accretive to our margins; and finally, three, it generates acceptable return on investment. Turning to the international markets. Outside North America, our more conservative outlook for the last several quarters is proving accurate. Our customers around the world have different breakeven thresholds and production requirements that all face the headwinds of the current commodity price environment. Due to lower cash flow and project economics, they are more focused than ever on lowering costs. The result of this combination is less activity and more pricing pressure. In contrast to North America, where we believe that a $50 oil price drives significant activity, customers tell me, the longer duration international markets will react less to absolute oil price but more to a positive view of where price will be for several years. This isn’t surprising, given the longer investment cycle that many of our customers face. I believe that we found a floor in the international rig count earlier this year. However, due to the longer term contractual nature of international markets and the level of continuing price pressure, I expect discounts will offset activity gains over the near-term. In this environment, we have to execute and maintain margin by controlling costs. Our international organization is committed to making the toughest of markets sustainable and has continued to rightsize the business during the quarter, demonstrating impressive control over their costs. In addition, customers embrace the way we go to market. We collaborate in engineered solutions to maximize asset value for our customers and it is paying off. In the eastern hemisphere, we achieved a modest improvement in activity in the third quarter but the landscape remains challenged. Pricing pressure and cost cutting remained major themes, and the use of technology to lower the cost per BOE is ever more important. Our products service lines continue to deliver technology that drives our value proposition, maximizing asset value. The Middle East remains our most active international market with the largest part of the work focused on mature fields. Among many important technologies deployed in the region, I’d like to highlight our CoreVault system. This system effectively stores sidewall cores with up to 2.5 times more oil and gas than previously. This additional reservoir characterization and effective means for doing so allow our customers to make more barrels and reduce cost. In the Middle East, we continue to build on our leading position in project management because of our ability to work closely with our customers and deliver superior service quality. Our most recent contract win is a project to deliver over 300 wells in Oman, and we’ve seen increased project management activity in this region, allowing us to showcase our services and technologies that reduce time and cost on a project. We have seen significant market share growth as we have a proven execution track record and deliver better wells for our customers. In the North Sea, this year has been about reducing production costs through standardization and technology optimization. We have the technology portfolio to solve our customers’ problems from single density, variable slurry cement that can be used for all sections of well to our data sphere array monitoring system that due to its modular design provides customized reservoir monitoring. We help structurally reduce cost by decreasing the time to drill and complete a well or by producing more barrels. What’s most important to point out is how we collaborate with customers and together we create terrific results. Another example is in the North Sea where our ruthless focus on service quality, collaboration with the operator and rig contractor, driving efficiency on critical path items and responding to customer insight has laid to record-breaking performance on a multi-well integrated services contract. This project is truly a collaborative effort and through the collective thought and execution of the team, they’ve been able to reduce the time to finish a full year scope of work by over 165 days, saving over $170 million. The improved efficiency came from two areas, technique solutions for record growing performance and collaboration where our commercially aligned team coordinated collaborative planning and execution. Latin America saw a slight rig count growth in the third quarter, driven by increased activity in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil. While activity is improving, the pricing pressures across the region make it increasingly important to be efficient as we execute. This quarter in Mexico, we designed and ran especially drill bit to help tackle a particularly difficult reservoir. This design reduced the necessary runs in hole, resulting in a three-day reduction in rig time. This example shows that even in a tough pricing environment, there is an appetite for new technology, especially if there were reduced costs. Finally, in recent days, commodity prices have experienced the modest rebound, as we have seen some signs of tightening in the macro supply demand picture. However, I still believe that the oil and gas industry will largely remain in a range-bound commodity price environment in the near to medium term. I am confident that Halliburton has the right strategy. In this environment, we’re focused on returns and capital discipline. In this type of sustaining market, I expect that our capital spending should be approximately aligned with our depreciation expense. Our working capital should continue to improve over time as our day sales outstanding declines to traditional levels and our free cash flow conversion should be in line with or exceed our peers, and to deliver these metrics, we’re focused on maximizing asset utilization, improving working capital velocity, and capital discipline. When I take all of those together, I am confident that we will generate solid free cash flow in today’s market environment. Pure and simple, Halliburton is proud to be a service company, and we believe our investors and customers appreciate that. I am confident that we’re working on the right things that create the most value and generate the highest returns. Our strong competitive position is not only a function of geographic footprint, it’s also the depths of the products and services that we provide to our customers and use it to generate industry-leading returns for our shareholders. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Chris for a financial update.
Chris Weber: Thanks, Jeff. Good morning. I’ll start with the summary of our third quarter results compared sequentially to our second quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5.4 billion, representing an increase of 10% while operating income was $634 million, an increase of 55%. These results were primarily driven by increased activity and pricing in North America. Turning to our division results. In our completion and production division, third quarter revenue increased by 13% while operating income increased 32%, primarily resulting from improved activity in pricing throughout North America land in our pressure pumping, completion tools and cementing product service lines. On the international side, increased completions activity in the Middle East and the start of new contracts in Brazil improved results. In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue and operating income increased by 4% and 44%, respectively. These increases were primarily due to increased drilling activity in the Middle East, North America and Latin America. Globally, we saw sequential improvement in all of our drilling and evaluation product lines. Let’s take a minute to review our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 14% sequentially, driven by increased utilization and pricing throughout the United States land sector in the majority of our products service lines, primarily pressure pumping as well as higher well completion and pressure pumping activity in Canada. In Latin America, we saw revenue increase by 4%, primarily driven by increased activity in Argentina, production group activity in Brazil, and increased drilling activity in Mexico. These results were partially offset by reduced well completion activity in Venezuela. Turning to Europe, Africa and CIS, revenue increased 6%, primarily due to improved utilization in the majority of our product service lines in the North Sea and improved drilling and well completion services in Russia and Nigeria. The results were partially offset by reduced activity in Angola. For Middle East/Asia, revenue increased 3%, primarily as a result of increased activity in the Middle East and project management activity in Indonesia, partially offset by reduced activity in pricing across Southeast Asia and lower project management activity in Iraq. Our corporate and other expense totaled $71 million in the third quarter and we expect our fourth quarter will be comparable to this quarter. As a function of our reduced debt balance, we reported $115 million in net interest expense for the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect net interest expense for the fourth quarter to remain at a similar level. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in at approximately 27%, slightly lower than expected due to variability in our earnings mix. For the fourth quarter, we expect the effective tax rate to range between 27% and 29%. Cash flow from operations during the third quarter was approximately $1.1 billion. Providing some color on our near-term operational outlook. As is typical for the fourth quarter, a combination of weather, holidays, budget constraints and year-end sales make forecasting a challenge, but this is how we see it playing out right now. Similar to prior years, we expect our U.S. land results to moderate in the fourth quarter due to the holidays and lower efficiency levels experienced in the winter months, particularly across the Rockies and Northern U.S. In our international business, we believe the typical seasonal uptick in year-end product and software sales will be lower this year versus traditional levels as customer budgets are largely exhausted. Given these factors, in our drilling and evaluation division, we expect North America revenue will change in line with the average U.S. land rig count while international revenue will increase by low-single digits. For our completion and production division, we expect that our North America revenue will outperform the average change in U.S. land rig count by several hundred basis points while international revenue will increase by low single digits. We expect the operating profitability for both of our divisions to increase marginally in the fourth quarter. Let me turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Chris. In closing, there are few things I want to highlight. First, I am very pleased with our third quarter results. I want to thank each of our employees for their hardworking commitment to execute at every turn and deliver Halliburton’s value preposition. These results clearly demonstrate the strength of our franchise and our ability to adapt to any environment. Second, Halliburton’s relative performance in the 2018 will remain strong, as a result of our ability to grow our North America revenue and margins, and improve our position in our international businesses. Finally, our strategy is working and we intend to stay the course. We are focused on delivering superior execution for our customers and achieving industry-leading returns and cash flow conversion for our shareholders. Now, let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. You may begin.
James West: Hey, good morning, guys.
Jeff Miller: Good morning, James. 
James West: Jeff, for the first time, I think I can remember that your earnings met or if you exclude some of the Harvey impact, they Schlumberger’s, which is pretty impressive I think. What part of your strategy would you attribute that to?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, James. Look, our strategy is pretty simple and very executable, and it’s to be the best service company. And that means we focused on leading returns, margins and revenue growth, and along with that technology, directly focused on returns, collaborating with our customers, the strong BD group, and then delivering service quality. I think that returns focused, I mean that is our strategy and is working.
James West: Got it. And then a follow-up from me to a comment that you made towards the end of your prepared statements. It sounds like spending within or spending the levels, CapEx hitting level that depreciation would be really just sustaining CapEx, so little kind of growth in PP -- or no growth in PP&E. Can you perhaps discuss the discipline here on your side with respect to adding equipment to the market?
Jeff Miller: Look, I -- when we look at the market as it’s playing out, I think we have what we need to execute. And as I described, what we see in front of us in terms of activity as I described international, described North America, I think at that sort of pace, then we ought to have a business that returns solid cash flow from that kind of market. And so, when I’ve described those types of parameters it’s to describe what we see. And you know again, focused on returns means that we are very efficient and we drive a lot of velocity with the equipment that we have, utilization, things of that nature, spend a lot of time talking about that. But that is in fact how we see generating a lot of cash flow.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin.
David Anderson: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Staying on the pressure pumping side just for a second here, your strategy in downturn is to gain share and stimulation. You talked about all your equipment deployed. So, I guess, I’m wondering right now, does pricing out there currently support new build economics? It seems like we’re in another one of those crossroads between maximizing returns or continuing to protect share. Can you discuss your thinking, please?
Jeff Miller: Well, I think we’re always going to be about returns. Clearly, we need share to drive the volume and the scale, and that’s where the efficiency and some of the things that I talk about are more meaningful at scale. But, specific to the building question, I’m just going to go back to what I said on this, answered this a couple of quarters now, but the three conditions being to meet client, leading edge pricing and generating adequate returns. But I don’t think that -- there is a lot of juice in utilization, there is a lot of juice and in effect market share comes from better utilization. So, I think you kind of under estimate the number of levers that we have in the market when it comes down to something that binary.
David Anderson: Thanks, Jeff. Kind of a different question, more strategic question, back in September, you talked about how HAL is not interested in financing E&P projects. It’s been a subject, something up quite a bit lately. Can you update us on your thoughts around performance based contracts and is there any desire on Halliburton’s part to invest in these types of projects along side your customers?
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks. This is -- for us, we call that integrated asset management, and it is really a capital allocation question; it’s where do we put our capital and what will make the best returns. And so, -- and along with those better returns, my view, a key part of that is asset velocity and to produce returns for shareholders. So, we’re not going to tie up our cash and things that we think had longer duration and likely lower returns. We have done some smaller deals, we’ve done a few things, we understand this space. And when we do it, we’ll do it with other people’s money to maintain those kinds of returns.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. You may begin.
Bill Herbert: Thank you. Good morning. Hey, Jeff and Chris. I guess, a comment with regard to -- I mean, you’ve made some I think some realistic and some encouraging comments with regard to your visibility and the continued pricing strength and tightness in the frac value chain accordingly. What should we expect for incrementals going forward? If you look at Q3 C&P, they were in the low 30s, which is typically reflective of volumetric incremental ramps in pricing, and I recognize that there was some Harvey nose. But, kind of in the market that we expect, not necessarily red hot from an activity standpoint but still tight and pricing still accommodating your utilization, you said that there is runway for improvement. Shouldn’t we expect incrementals to be higher than what we have at the end of the third quarter?
Chris Weber: Yes, this is Chris. We’re not giving guidance on incrementals. We’re focused on margin expansion. We talked about margin improvement and our profitability. When we look at the pace that we’re at, I mean, we got almost a 1,000 basis points of margin expansion in few quarters of C&P. And Jeff spent a lot of time talking about the path towards those normalized margins, the levers that we have to pull. So, we’re confident of that path. Now, remember C&P is more than just frac and P&E in North America. We’ve also got our production business lines; we’re investing in those business lines, looking to grow in line with that Summit acquisition. So, there are other elements of that, but we feel strongly about that path with the levers that we have to pull that Jeff laid out.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And if we could drill down on pricing just a little bit more. I guess the narrative, industry-wide coming into this quarter was that leading edge pricing was still supportive of new build economics. But slope of the event that we witnessed year-to-date was flattening, not flattened, but flattening, and there was still continued convergence between leading edge and legacy pricing. Is that a fair summation as to where pricing stands today?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Bill, I think that’s reasonable. Our guys push price all of the time. And so, maybe not accelerating the way it did in the spring, but still opportunity and momentum in North America. I think if we look at Q3, bit of a cause just as commodity prices bounced into the 40s, but we talked about, first and foremost finding the right customer to drive efficiency, and it doesn’t change the demand for our services today, and along with that comes ability to move on price.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin.
Angie Sedita: So, I appreciate the color on returning to normalize margins for North America. And maybe you could a little bit more about two of the levers, right, utilization and cost cutting, a little bit more color there on how much more you think you have to be done on utilization side as well as on the cost cutting, and maybe even a little bit the timeline on how much we could see that clearing into 2018?
Jeff Miller: Well, I think if the question’s around the path to normalized margins, I’ve always said, it starts with customer urgency. We see that, calendar power being also important in terms of driving utilization and working with the efficient client. In terms of how far there is to move, each of those levers has fair amount of ways to move. I won’t give you the specifics, but it’s one of those things that we work every day. But it’s the precision around, for example what happens on location being able to measure all of those steps. And again, the measurement scale is a bit of a different matter. But, what’s special about that is that now when we make changes and drive efficiency, again driving better utilization, we can drive across just a fleet at a time. And so that gives me a lot of confidence around the ability to improve the number of turns on equipment in a day. From a cost perspective, we’re constantly working that. I’ve talked about our continuous improvement being one of the pillars of our strategy but really, Angie that’s what we do to systematically drive cost out of all of the components of our business. And often times that includes technology, I referred to some of that in my script. But, it’ll also be technology that takes all kinds of forms, some is customer-facing, a lot of it internally facing, so that all of that value accrues to us in terms of reducing costs. I hope that helps.
Angie Sedita: Yes. That does help. I appreciate that. And then, as an unrelated follow-up. Maybe you could talk a little bit about your fleet today and just as a reminder, how much of your frac fleet that’s in the field today is Q10 versus legacy assets and just thoughts on the life of those assets and replacement or upgrades over time?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, Angie. That’s probably about 60% of the fleet Q10 today. But again, big push several years ago with our retrofit, the fleet with Q10, don’t have that same requirement today, and that’s when we talk about capital, that’s why I’m comfortable with the kind of capital progression we laid out in this kind of market, because there is a very natural sort of replacement that happens over time. I will do that with Q10s, but I don’t think it’s going to be -- it won’t be anything like maybe what you’ve seen in the past. And the Q10s really have delivered and we continue to go to market with solidly less horsepower than competitors. And I think that also gets to -- if we think about the industry’s pace of replacement, I think we’re going to well outperform that and that’s going to show up in the form of returns.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. You may begin.
Q - Jud Bailey: Thanks. Good morning. Just of follow up on Angie’s question. You highlighted kind of the three levers you still have to pull you think you can pull to get to normalized margins. I’d be curious is -- of the three, is one a bigger driver than the other at this point, or are they all kind of equal or is one going to be a bigger driver? And, is there a way to think about the timing in which to kind of get to that level, is that a still a realistic possibility in 2018?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Short answer, yes, Jud, on to get there in 2018. The pulling on the different levers, you know us; we’re going to pull every lever we got. But those are the big levers that when we pull them, have the more meaningful impact. So, I’m not going to break one above the other necessarily, actually all three of them are very powerful. And we’re working this.
Jud Bailey: Okay. That’s fair. And my follow-up question is you alluded to it in your prepared comments that your strategy on artificial lift and kind of the production side of the business. Could you -- you have Summit, is the strategy to kind of grow that platform across the Halliburton global platform or do you still see other opportunities out there that could supplement Summit on both production chemicals and artificial lift side?
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks. Well that’s the all of production is an opportunity for us to grow, in our wheelhouse, it’s -- as I talk about our strategy to collaborate an engineered solution, that fits well with what we do. Summit was such a nice add, I give a shout out to the new employees we have from Summit, fantastic business and yes, very scalable. And clearly, the plan is to scale that beyond the U.S. and to our international operations. And those activities are underway. The other components of that, I’ve talked about chemicals. I think that will likely be a more organic move than it is M&A, maybe a little bit a bolt-on around that. But, the guys are working hard at that every day, and I really think that that is something that we will just systematically build out and we’ll talk about it from time-to-time along that path, probably not every quarter but as it continues to grow, we’ll give you a better insight into that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
Jim Wicklund: The biggest issue, of course now we’re talking about what 2019 earnings are going to be, but for the last several weeks, you had an all price high enough that E&Ps have been hedging, the head of Total mentioned at a London concert -- conference that U.S. E&Ps have been hedging like crazy, you guys have a little bit of visibility into 2018. I realize your customers really haven’t set their budgets yet. But, the discussions that you are having, are they more constructive now than they were before? Can you give us what little outlook you may be able to have for 2018, as we sit here today?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean, Jim, our board is full through the first part of 2018 and the reality is the only people that probably talk to more customers than me is my BD group and I talk to the BD group every day. And so, we’re having constructive conversations about 2018 and encouraging discussions. I think the $50 oil through the planning cycle is a great thing, yes, and I mean this is the right time. And so, they are absolutely planning to work next year, hedges are getting in place. And I think it’s -- interesting thing, when we talk to our customers, we don’t lecture our customers, I mean, we listen to them. Because we listen to them, we hear the message that they are getting from their stakeholders, and I think this is important point. Because all of our -- with all of our conversations, my personal conversations, some are very focused on returns and there are others that are going to shoot them in because they like the acreage that they have. But that’s because that’s what their shareholders want. And at the end of the day, we work for both sets of customers. And so, I am very encouraged going into 2018, Jim.
Jim Wicklund: That’s positive; I’ll take that, good. Second question if I could. Jud mentioned artificial lift; we all know Dover is in the market. Your balance sheet is a little over levered. Can you talk about what the plan is Chris, maybe through 2017 and through 2018 in terms of balance sheet ratios and freedom to do deals?
Chris Weber: Yes. So, I mean, just in terms of the balance sheet and we’ve talked about desire to further delever. I mean, we retired the $1.4 billion earlier this year. We’ve got a maturity in August of next year, $400 million that we plan to retire. We like to see our credit metrics normalize, debt to EBITDA under 2.5 times, debt to cap moving back into 30s and so focused on working towards those metrics.
Jeff Miller: And Jim, I’ll just add the discussion around. Production and some of these things is part of what makes that C&P group a big group, and there is a lot of moving parts in there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Timna Tanners with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. You may begin.
Timna Tanners: I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about any future improvement, international in particular, your comments on taking market share, if you can elaborate a little bit on how and where you have been doing that and if you have further rightsizing internationally?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, Tim. I think that team absolutely executing in the marketplace. I think we are taking share by virtue of the performance that we saw this quarter and we’ve seen for several quarters. But, I think probably what’s more important when we think about international is I think we have a more realistic view what that market is. For example, we’re seeing more activity or at least signs of activity in the form of FIDs and things. But those are not tenders; those don’t convert the service revenue quickly. We did find the bottom, but I think that those are very competitive markets with a lot of visibility around the activity in those international markets. And so, I do believe that the pricing pressure will persist and likely offset a lot of the gains that you might expect from that kind of activity, particularly as we go into 2018.
Timna Tanners: Okay. So, rightsizing may continue there, it sounds like?
Jeff Miller: Yes. And I think that’s just part of a process. It’s a combination of our continuous improvement activities where we’re consistently looking at technology to drive cost out. But, it’s hard; it is taking those things and turning it into how do we operate at lower cost point. And I would say that that team has done that consistently. That’s not a projection. They will just manage all the levers that they have to manage.
Timna Tanners: Okay. And I just want to follow up on Harvey, if there is lingering impact into the fourth quarter and if that -- or if that’s been what’s behind in the third quarter?
Jeff Miller: I think that’s behind as at the end of Q3.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. You may begin.
Scott Gruber: Jeff, I wanted to start with your digital transformation strategy. I think Halliburton is doing more than many investors realize. Can you discuss your broader strategy around this effort, such as the OpenEarth initiative, the Microsoft alliance? And importantly, are E&Ps more willing to share data in the credit environment or how do you work around the reluctance to share data if not and still deliver value enhancing tools?
Jeff Miller: Yes. No, very excited about our strategy and I think we’ve laid that out but it is -- at its heart, and this is an important distinction and open architecture strategy which makes it a lot easier for customers to use. I think there will always be competition around data between customers. And I think customers are taking a closer and closer look at their own data and who owns and controls that data, and I suspect they will control it more so. It is just very competitive for our customers. And so, when we think about that, we want to make certain that we have the right set of tools that can be used effectively by them. And they’re open in the sense that our customers uptake of those tools and they can make them do what they need them to do. And I think tools is probably an oversimplification, I’m describing more of a platform and the philosophy. But, as we work with Microsoft for example, that’s again an ability to leverage I think a lot of investment and R&D and cloud that will help our customers. But again, I will tell you, we are very returns oriented. And so, when I think about what we do, we’re very specific about where we create value and what it proves to us versus necessarily scatter shooting across the space.
Scott Gruber: Got it, appreciate the color. And unrelated follow-up on the domestic frac market and the sand per well trend. What are you hearing from your customers regarding their potential response to falling sand prices as the new local Permian mines come on? Do you anticipate them using more sand per well? Does that uptrend begin to anew? Do they simply go out and drill more wells, which you may hear about through in discussions around on fleet expansion? How do you think they respond to falling sand prices, particularly in the Permian?
Jeff Miller: I think all of our -- that will create -- lower costs, will create more headroom for our clients to work, no question. But I think the more important dynamic in the Permian than the price necessarily today is, is they better understand those reservoirs and how to make the best production at the lower cost per BOE. That’s why I held out the Permian as one where we see sands per well increasing. And I think that’s more evidentiary of our market that’s being learned as opposed to one being optimized and that makes perfect sense and that’s what our customers do. They make the best investment and they manage their business very carefully. And so, when they make decisions to do more of something, there will be a reason for that. I think that’s more the reason in West Texas today as reservoirs are better understood in other parts of the country that’s where you start to see more of that optimization. But, I would expect that it does free up more cash for doing more work, which is certainly positive. But, I would not assume that they don’t optimize in West Texas at some point either.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Wolfe Research. You may begin.
Chase Mulvehill: Good morning, Jeff. So, quick question on the C&P margin side. It came a little bit light of market expectations. Can you talk about what you are seeing as potential bottlenecks on the U.S. completion side and if they had an impact in 3Q?
Jeff Miller: I think as I described earlier specific to margins in C&P, we are making investments in other things, like production group is in that group. And so, there is more going on in that than purely North America frac. But, as it is a different question in terms of what kind of bottlenecks do we see, obviously, the Hurricane drove some bottlenecks here and across the country. I think that as mines come on, a lot of the bottlenecks you hear about around sand get alleviated. Again, when you have a bit of a differentiated view to those things given where we are and the fact our ability to buy at scale particularly with respect to sand, but then equally around people, again, we talk about people lot and our ability to hire the national level for people I think gives us a differentiated position as we view those bottlenecks.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. And the guidance for 4Q on the margin side, you said profitability will be marginally better in 4Q. Was that percentage margins or an absolute margin dollar when you said marginally better?
Chris Weber: Percentage margins.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay. So, the last one, on the three levers that you mentioned with pricing utilization and cost reduction, how close are we to optimizing each of these levers?
Jeff Miller: A plenty of room to move on all three.
Chase Mulvehill: Okay.
Jeff Miller: I mean that’s what we do every day; we’re always working on those.
Operator: Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. You may begin.
Sean Meakim: So, Chris noted in the marginally better margins, but on the D&E specifically, trying to get a better sense of sustainability of that 3Q run rate, given pricing remains pretty challenging internationally, activities up but not dramatically. Could you give a little more context with that move in the margin to give a sense of the look forward?
Jeff Miller: I mean, if the question is, are the one-offs in there, the reality there aren’t any one-offs in there; that group is absolutely executing very well, and I would say systematically driving cost out of the business, they winning the contracts they need to win and they are -0 we continue to drive technology into the D&E group that I think is paying off. And I’ve talked about the investment we’ve made in Sperry for some time. And I think that’s beginning to pay off. I think there is a lot of runway actually left to go there. But, it will come probably in fits and starts as we go into next year.
Sean Meakim: Okay. Thank you for that Jeff. That’s helpful. And then just on -- following up on the expansion plans for production and Summit. How do you think about strategically owning assets versus aligning Halliburton in partnerships with others where you’re trying to expand your reach globally?
Jeff Miller: With respect to production specifically, it will be -- we’ll invest in those things that we think we can uniquely use to drive value for us; in those places where we can’t, we’ll look to partner. I -- very much the strategy being executed now. So, I won’t get into all -- anymore details than that. But I would say, generally speaking, we’re not afraid to and in fact we will seek to, in some cases partner with companies that we believe are in businesses that we don’t want to be in, but maybe form part of the value chain. And I think we’ve demonstrated the ability to do that very effectively. In fact with rigs, we work very closely with rig contractors and had a lot of success in our project management business, driving lower cost and better returns, probably for us and the rig contractor than we would, if we were somehow jointly investing.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.
Kurt Hallead: I was wondering if you can give us an update, generate significant amount of cash and maybe kind of run through the priorities on that cash again for us between growth, dividend, buying back stock. And when you think about the growth dynamics, where would you be directing that? It sounds like North America, but just looking for some color on that.
Chris Weber: Yes. This is Chris. I’ll take that. As I mentioned earlier, in terms of use of free cash flow, we are still focused on debt retirement and we have the $400 million maturity next year that we intend to pay off. We’ll consider growth opportunities, both acquisitions and organic and want to be value accretive, generate industry-leading service company returns, and that’s in terms of absolute level and the speed with which we realize those returns or short duration or rapid payback. And after that, we’ll look at returning cash to shareholders and considering both dividends and share buybacks.
Kurt Hallead: Okay, great. And maybe follow-up to one of the prior questions when you kind of talk about your three levers, trying to get back to normalized earnings. In your mind, Jeff, which one of those three would probably carry the most weight in 2018, as you see it right now?
Jeff Miller: We’ll have to see when 2018 gets here, Kurt. I mean, we use all of them that are available. And I am not -- and I will tell you, I put sort of equal time in all three of them. I’ll just go back to sort of Chris’s view -- incredible, as he mentioned earlier, we’ve come a long way, two quarters and we will continue to use all of those levers as we move into next year.
Chris Weber: Yes, and this is Chris. Like we said, we’re on the path, fourth quarter with the seasonality and weather, holidays, customer budgets, I mean, obviously not representative of what that normal path looks like, but with the margin guidance, the revenue guidance that we provided, we think that’s generally aligned with consensus estimate.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I’d like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Okay. Thank you, Shannon. Look, I’d like to wrap the call up with a couple of key takeaways today. First, the third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our franchise and the effectiveness of our strategy. I thank all of our employees for their commitment to execution. Finally, I expect Halliburton’s relative performance in 2018 will remain strong as a result of our ability to grow North America revenue and margins and improve our position in our international businesses. So, I look forward to talking with you next quarter. Shannon, you may close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lance Loeffler. Please go ahead.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2017 conference call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me this morning is Dave Lesar, Executive Chairman. Jeff Miller, President and CEO; and Chris Weber, CFO.  Before we begin, I'd like to point out that this will be Dave's last time to participate on our earnings call given his new role as Executive Chairman.  As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Form 10- Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures, and unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of the early extinguishment of debt and charges related to interest bearing promissory note that Halliburton intends to execute with its primary customer in Venezuela. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release, which can be found on our website. Finally, our after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and related follow-up during the Q&A period in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Lance, and good morning to everyone. Our performance this quarter demonstrates that Halliburton is the execution company, and we are the leader in North America. Here are our few key highlights. Total North America revenue increased 24%, outpacing the average outpacing the average sequential US land rig count growth of 21%. North America margins grew into the double digits. And although our international operations continued to be challenged, the numbers came in about as expected. And we continue to tailor our business to the market as we wait for our recovery. And we outperformed our major peer in every single geo market, demonstrating once again that we continue to grow our market share globally.  Since this is my last call, today I want to share with you my view of the evolution of the North America land market. Our customer base there and why I believe it will continue to surprise to the upside. Now for 25 years I have had fantastic front row seat to the development of US unconventional resources. We have become the largest service company in North America and that growth didn't by accident. First, it was due to the leadership of Jim Brown and his visionary management team. They saw the potential of unconventional resources in the region but the same time as a group of key early mover customers. As a result, we decided to work together using lots of trial and error to unlock this resource. We established enduring customer relationships and gained unparallel base and knowledge that still provides us a sustained advantage today.  I think it's important to look at the North America unconventional ecosystem to understand our customers' behavior. And why their ability to so quickly increase production has expanded rapidly. Currently, there is strongly held view by energy investors that the US independent operators behave as a group. That view is wrong. When thousands of companies make discrete decisions about the same market, each day they do have tendency to swing the activity and production pendulum to far one way or the other. That is not group bank, is the impact of individuals trying to do the right thing for their investors.  Our US customer base is not 10 or so countries like OPEC. It is made of thousands of companies from IOCs to individually owned businesses. When you look at them separately, you see thousands of entrepreneurial, smart and motivated risk takers. They readily adapt to the quality of their reservoirs, have almost unlimited access to capital, aggressively applying new technology and quickly mark their business model and structures to meet changing market conditions. And, yes, sometimes even take advantage of US restructuring laws. They are you are classic American entrepreneurs, and their success should recognized. In Silicon Valley, such a success would be greatly celebrated as another industry disruptor. The unconventional disruption is not widely celebrated beyond the energy space, but it should be. The development of US unconventional resources has been as disruptive to the global energy market as Amazon has been to Big Box Retailing or Uber to the taxi business. You don't leash to wave of cheap, reliable energy that is disrupted global geopolitical and energy dynamics. Made the US more energy independent caused OPEC to react and changed the fundamental economic of offshore production. And I believe it is created a hundreds of billions of dollars of economic value, added hundreds of millions of dollars to government tax coffers and provided untold savings for consumers. So unconventional is what I would call a disruptor, so let's celebrate that. I've heard energy investors say that today's customer behavior shows nothing was learned in the last downturn. That simply is not true. Our customers are smart and adoptive. And they do learn from the past. Their business DNA is to be survivors and they are. Look at the reaction in the past several weeks. Today, rig count growth is showing signs of plateauing and customers are tapping the brakes. This demonstrates that individual companies are making rational decision in the best interest of their shareholders. This tapping of the brakes is happening all over the place in North America. I can tell you the market will respond, it will rebalance and these companies will stay alive, survive and thrive because that's what they do.  I said several quarters ago the customer and animal spirits back and they are with a vengeance and they are now running free to North America. Here is my last piece of wisdom for you. Do not bet against the animal spirits that our North America customers embody. I never have and I never will because that is the bet that you will lose.  Now today is my last conference call. And I'd like to take a moment to thank our analysts and investors. It has been pleasure working with you and although we haven't always agreed, I've always enjoyed the spirited debate and intelligent conversations. I'd also like to thank the employees at Halliburton for their hard work throughout my career. We've been through many cycles, emerging stronger from each one and I am proud of what we've accomplished together. And even though I'll be absent from future calls, I look forward to the next 18 months serving Halliburton as Executive Chairman. I am happy to leave these calls in capable hands of Jeff, Chris and the other members of our experienced management team. I have not doubt they will continue to lead the company as a customer centric and returns focused business. And remember one thing, we are the execution company.  With that I'll turn the call over to Jeff. 
Jeff Miller: Well, thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with our second quarter results. We continue to execute our strategy to maximize asset value for our customers and deliver differentiated technology and services that we believe will generate superior returns over the long term.  Here are some highlights for the second quarter. Total company revenue was $5 billion, representing a 16% increase compared to the first quarter of this year. Total adjusted operating income was $408 million, primarily driven by continued strengthening of market conditions in North America, which were partially offset by pricing pressure internationally. Our North America revenue increased by 24% outperforming the average sequential U.S. land rig count growth of 21%. The Completion and Production division revenue increased 20% and operating margins improved by an impressive 700 basis points to approximately 13%, driven by the strength of our production enhancement, cementing and completion tools product service lines. Cash flow from operations delivered about $350 million.  I'd like to a moment now to welcome some of the Summit ESP and its employees to the Halliburton family. We are pleased to announce this recent transaction and are excited about what it means for us as we continue to strengthen our artificial lift capabilities. Now I'd like to provide some regional commentary around our quarterly performance. I believe we found the bottom of the international rig count in the first quarter. However, I don't expect a near term rebound in the international markets for several reasons. First, the lengthy contracting cycles will mute any near-term pricing inflection. Second, our international customers need confidence and commodity prices in order to overcome the duration risk in their project. We continue to collaborate with our customers to lower the cost on these projects and while some are moving towards FID, it's important to remember that there is a significant time between planning FID and revenue generation for Halliburton. And finally, I've been consistently more conservative on the international market. And it's played out exactly how I called it. Today, I expect that there will be improvement and activity over the remainder of the year. But these improvements are not concentrated enough to offset the continued pricing pressure. As a result, the international markets will continue to move sideways. With all of this said, it's important to understand that we are now into the third sequential year of significant under spending in the international markets. This implies that the production decline outside of certain OPEC countries will begin to accelerate, particularly next year as the backlogs of new projects are completed and additional projects are not coming behind.  In the meantime, we are actively managing cost while protecting our valuable international position for the eventual market recovery. With the current level of under investment internationally, production declines are a certainty and you know where that leads.  Our Drilling and Evaluation division is driven in large part by our international footprint. And while we experienced a modest increase this quarter, largely driven by increased drilling activity in Latin America and the seasonal rebound in North Sea and Russia, the overall market continues to move side ways with continued pricing pressure.  Now turning to North America. After the operation we gave in the first quarter, some of you were skeptical when we accelerated our equipment reactivation. But based on performance during the second quarter, there is no doubt we successfully executed our plan and that this decision was not only right but dead on target. Why is that? During the second quarter, we continue to see strong incremental demand for completion equipment from customers. The reactivated equipment we brought back with the market leading edge pricing and it has been accretive to overall margin and is expected to deliver acceptable returns that exceed our cost of capital.  Our sand war room and logistic central structure allow us to manage the completions intensity our customer demand today. And we've been successful passing along supply cost increases to our customers. Our internal manufacturing capability is a proven differentiator in today's environment. It allows us to be flexible. And being able to build what we need, when we needed particularly in a rapidly changing market. Now today, we believe the current customer demand has outpaced the supply of completions equipment and this should create runway for a strong utilization through the second half of the year. We remain committed to generating industry leading returns and reactivating our equipment was the first step towards delivering the results you have come to expect from us. As some of you've heard me say before, customer urgency is the foundation for the path to normalize margin. Today, our customers remain urgent. And therefore, we believe our path to normalized margins is achievable. We get there through a combination of increasing leading pricing, improved legacy pricing, better utilization and continued cost control.  Let me be clear. Our pressure pumping equipment is sold out in the third quarter. As we gauge the utilization of our equivalent on a 24x7 basis, we see a significant opportunity to improve and drive the downtime out of our calendar. In this environment, it's imperative to be aligned with the most efficient customers where we can create value for them while delivering the best returns for Halliburton. Filling our calendar with high proficient customers is an important part what allows us to achieve margin goal. Looking forward, it's too early to tell the impact of commodity prices on customer plans for 2018. However, as Dave said earlier in Halliburton we never underestimate our customers' ability to adapt to the environment. In the first quarter, we experienced significant inflation in sand prices and increased volumes. As we continue to pass through sand cost to our customers, we expect to see greater technology adoption making better wells through engineered solutions.  For the first time in years, in the second quarter we experienced our first decline in average sand pump for well. Let me repeat that because I think this is important. We saw a decline in the average sand pump per well. And while this is only one data point, it's something we will be watching. We believe current sand price levels have encouraged operators to optimize their completion design using more science as opposed to simply maximizing sand and trade for increased production. We maximize returns on our technology investment by being the most effective in the market at lowering our customer's cost per BOE. Our strategy around technology development is to make returns for Halliburton. Very simply our decision process around technology can be summed up in a three questions. First, does it reduce cost? Second, does it produce more barrels? Or third, does it do both? As a result, we create cutting technology that sets new standards for service quality and performance while making better wells for our customers.  For example, on a recent effort in the Permian basin we used our Trans and permeability modifiers to increase production by over 60% compared to previous completion methods. The Trans and permeability enhancer portfolio is our premier offering for flow enhancing technology. Using proprietary micro motion technology Trans and enhancer expand the reservoir contact area and improve fluid flow to increase the recovery factor for our customers. For unconventional matured fields, we developed the bare shield like fluid system. Tailored to reservoirs salt formation and low fracture pressure to reduce circulation loss and washout. This custom tailoring allows us to reduce muddle off, increase drilling efficiency and ensures zonal isolation for an efficient completion. In today's environment, it's crucial that technology be adaptable to customer demand and improves efficiency. During the second quarter, our industry leading cementing technology [Neosam] was used in over 350 wells per month. Including cementing the longest onshore lateral in history. A well that we are now completing. Neosam delivers high performance compressor strength, elasticity and share bond that lower density in conventional system saving time and providing improved performance. Now these three examples show the creativity of our chemistry based research and development teams. We have terrific engineers and scientists looking at every way we can create efficiencies, reduce cost and make more barrels.  Internally, we have similar initiative of continuous improvement, including reducing the time for R&D projects to come to market like our very deep resistivity tool which went from design to field in only nine months. Our surface efficiency initiative of hydraulic fracturing that reduce the downtime between stages. We are always pushing to improving our processes and optimize the services that we bring in the market.  Overall, I am confident about Halliburton's ability to grow North America margins and maintain a run rate for our international business for the remainder of the year. Our strategy is working well. And we intend to stay to course. We'll continue to drive superior execution and remain absolutely focused on delivering best in class returns. North America is clearly serving us as the world swing producer which means this is where the game will be played and Halliburton is the distinct leader in this market.  Now I'd like to welcome Chris Weber to the Halliburton team as our new CFO. Throughout his career, he is working consulting operations and finance with significant international experiences. These combined traits will help Halliburton and may make him an excellent fit for our team.  With that I'm going to turn the call over to Chris to provide some details around our financials. Chris? 
Chris Weber: Thanks Jeff. And good morning, everyone. Let's start with the summary of our second quarter results compared sequentially to our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $5 billion, representing an increase of 16%, while operating income doubled to $408 million. These results were primarily driven by the improved activity in pricing in our completion and production division in our North America. Now let me compare our divisional results to the first quarter of 2017. In our Completion and Production division, second quarter revenue increased by 20% while operating income increased 170% primarily driven by increased activity in pricing in our U.S. land pressure pumping business. We also experienced well completion activity primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea and Russia, partially offset by pricing pressure in the Middle East.  Turning to our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income increased by 9% and 2% respectively, primarily due to increased US drilling activity. In United States, our drilling and evaluation revenue grew in line with rig count. On the international side, revenue was up due to increased drilling activity in Latin America, North Sea and Russia, partially offset by price pressure across the international markets.  Now let me take a minute to compare our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 24% sequentially, primarily driven by continued improvement in pricing and activity in our US land business, particularly our pressure pumping and well construction product service lines, as well as higher completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico. In Latin America, we saw revenue increase by 10%, primarily driven by increased drilling activity in Mexico, Venezuela and Columbia, as well as higher stimulation activity in Argentina.  Turning to Europe-Africa-CIS, revenue increased 12%, primarily due to a seasonal rebound in the North Sea and Russia resulting in higher drilling, well completions and pipeline and process service activity. For Middle East-Asia, revenue increased 2% primarily as a result of increased fluid services in Asia-Pac and higher wire line and well completion activity in the Middle East, partially offsetting these increases were pricing pressure throughout the region, as well as declines in fluids and stimulation services in the Middle East.  Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $114 million in the second quarter, which was higher than originally anticipated, primarily due to approximately $42 million in litigation settlement and one time executive compensation expense during the quarter. Of which $29 million in a loss contingency in connection with an understanding with the SEC staff to settle the previously disclosed investigation of certain past matters related to our operations in Angola and Iraq. The settlement is pending approval by the commissioners of the SEC. Separately; the DOJ has advised this but has completed its investigation of these matters and will not be taking any action. We anticipate that our corporate expenses will be approximately $70 million for the third quarter of 2017.  During the quarter, we also recognized a pretax charge of $262 million for a fair market adjustment which is required by accounting rule related to an expected exchange of $375 million of our Venezuela receivables for an interest bearing promissory note of that same value. This note is with our long standing primary customer in Venezuela similar to the Venezuela notes exchange we did in the second quarter of 2016; this new instrument will provide a defined payment schedule while generating a return. We intend to hold the notes to maturity and expect to collect 100% of the principal. It's important to note that to date, we've received all payments required by the 2016 notes.  At a function of reduced debt balance, we reported a $121 million in net interest expense for the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect net interest expense for the third quarter to remain at a similar level. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in lower than expected at approximately 23%, due to certain discrete items related to prior year audits. For the remainder of 2017, we still expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 29% to 30%.  Cash flow from operations during the second quarter was approximately $350 million and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and equivalents. These results were largely driven by improvement in day sales outstanding. Historically, our annual cash flow is backend loaded for the year and we don't believe that 2017 will be any difference. Continued improvement in our earnings in a number of working capital initiatives should strengthen our cash generated from operations as the year progresses.  Now I'd like to provide some color on our near-term operational outlook. The Macro micro dynamics make forecasting a challenge but this is how we see the third quarter playing out. For our Completion and Production division, we expect that our North America sequential revenue will outperform average US land rig count, while international revenue will remain flat. In addition, we expect margins for the division to increase by 225 to 325 basis points. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, we are anticipating North America revenue will grow in line with the average US land rig count, while the international market will remain flat to slightly down. We expect margins for this division to remain relatively flat sequentially. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for a few closing comments. Jeff? 
Jeff Miller: In closing, there are few things I want to highlight. Our second quarter results clearly demonstrated the strength of our franchise in North America and our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing environment. If you believe in energy, you should be invested in North America. Halliburton's relative performance for the balance of the year will remain strong. As a result of our ability to grow our North America margins and continues to maintain revenue and margins in our international business. Our strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. We'll continue to drive superior execution and remain focused on delivering best-in-class returns.  I want to take a moment to thank Dave for his leadership at Halliburton during the 17 years as CEO. He created an amazing legacy and our employees, customers and shareholders have benefited greatly from his management of our company. I have had the pleasure of working with Dave for almost 30 years. He is an important mentor to me. Together, we developed the strategy and leadership team for our company and I look forward to working with him over the next 18 months.  Before we open the call up for question, I'll go ahead and ask the first one myself because I know it's on everyone's mind. What are we doing around new build equipment? The simple answer is that we are first and foremost a returns focused organization. We have the ability to make a series of discrete decisions around equipment and will only bring it out under certain conditions. First, that it is backed by customer commitment. Second, that it captures leading edge pricing which is accretive to our margins. And finally, it generates acceptable return on investment. So let me remind everyone, that we have not invested in our legacy fleet in two and half years, prudently managing the health of our fleet is important to maintain the type of service quality and reliability that our customers have come to expect. Therefore, some replacement of equipment will be necessary over time. Our manufacturing center in Duncan is a powerful, competitive differentiator for our organization. It allows us to be nimble and build equipment is needed with short lead times. This flexibility allows us to control the rate at which we manufacture, building as little as 2,000 horsepower at a time if need be. We delivered what we said we would on the reactivation plan. When we build additional equipment, we will do it with same discipline around returns. Halliburton is the execution company and you have to trust me to do the right thing. Run the business in the right way and make the right decisions. That answers it.  Now let's open it up for other questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo.
Jud Bailey: Thank you. Good morning. Great and first let me say it, Dave, congratulation on a great career, CEO of Halliburton. I enjoyed working with you last several years. Okay, thanks. First question, I wanted to just circle back on the impact of reactivation in 2Q and how to think about any impact on our third quarter. It was talked about in terms of impacting, negative impacting margins on your first quarter call. You still had incrementals in CMP close to 50%. Could you maybe walk us through how you are able to offset some of the reactivation costs? And then to what extent will reactivation cost impact the third quarter? And do you intend to reactive any more equipment or is it more refers or new build at this point?
Jeff Miller: Look, Jud. Thanks. Bottom line is the costs were lower than expected in Q2. And that's because we got there faster and cheaper than we thought. Our Duncan manufacturing team just simply way out performed both by speed and bringing down the cost of everything. The other thing that happened is our people went back to work faster and that's principally because of all of the demand that we saw for our equipment. I supposed one other thing as we were successful in bringing back a large quantity of former Halliburton employees which is something we always wanted to do, but that also mean to say go back to work more quickly with substantially less training. As we look ahead to Q3, obviously there will be new challenges to deal with. For example our employees. Our employees haven't had raises in three years. So we plan to for example provide our employees with raises. But I would like to do is to listen Chris' guidance on completion and production. We said we outperformed the rig count growth on revenue and continue to improve margin. So that's truly how we see that. 
Jud Bailey: Okay. And I just as my follow up just to kind of think about the progress on or just to CMP for now. One of the scenarios that talked about if oil prices stay between 45 and 50 that we continue to step up in terms of completion activity next couple of quarters then maybe level off. Is getting to normalized margins are realistic scenario in your mind? And if so, do we hit those by the fourth quarter or can we -- would it be reasonable to anticipate being at normalized margins in next year if activity were to kind of level off at 4Q levels? 
Jeff Miller: Look, we are not backing off our expectation on normalized margins. As I said it and I won't give you a date but I don't have a crystal ball but I'd suspect it would be into 2018. But it starts with customer urgency as I've described. And that really means having targets, to meet targets and that's where we absolutely shine it on. That's what our value proposition does. And we still see supply and demand tightness. I mean our calendar is full as we look out. And so I don't see any change in my outlook. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
James West: Hey, good morning, gentlemen. And Dave my congrats as well on one hell of a run at Halliburton. Jeff, I know you answered my question already to a certain extent at the end of your prepared comments there. But as we think about new builds in the market, you laid out your three criteria for new build. Are we at those criteria yet and are you contemplating new builds kind of as we speak besides replacement of increment and new builds? 
Jeff Miller: Yes, look, I am going to go back to what I said on this, James. And I'd be crazy to lay out our market strategy in detail here. But I laid out the conditions which is committed client contracts or commitments from clients, leading edge pricing and then the ability to generate adequate return. Short answer is we haven't built anything so far this quarter. But I'd say if the opportunity above does present itself then we have the ability and the capability to quickly meet that demand with Duncan. 
James West: Okay, fair enough. And then Jeff as my follow up here, we have seen some additions by smaller companies that are most of the ones that either IPO or tried IPO need to show some growth to do that. But as you look at your major competitors and look across the pressure pumping marketplace, do you see much additional or incremental horsepower being added outside of kind of what's probably the natural attrition in the market? 
Jeff Miller: No. I mean our view had always been that there would be attrition. We see that and today our view that market is in fact sold out. That's part of the reason we see ducks building and other thing, and we really got the same amount of horsepower that's been in the market, changed hands in a couple of instances but with respect to the headline amount of horsepower that was there in 2014, we are well short off that today. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons.
Bill Herbert: Thank you. Good morning. Jeff, a quick question here for you. Just given the absence of reactivation friction or at least not as much as in the third quarter, a sort of pricing that you are gleaning given the under supply nature of the frac market and the sense of urgency that you talked about, and a leveling off the supply chain inflation. And, yes, so that mentioned some wage inflation but why one incrementals in the third quarter for CMP be better than what they were in the second quarter because your guidance implies assuming a low double digit rate of revenue extension somewhere kind of in the 40% to 45% kind of margin range and strikes me as conservative based upon the fact as you have laid them out.
Jeff Miller: Well, first of all, I won't lay all of that out and when we think about what Dave said in terms of tapping the brakes. And so we see some tapping of the brake which in my view better described as let's going from 80 miles an hour to 70 miles an hour. But it hasn't limited the ability to push on price. And our guys absolutely doing that everyday. And as I said, we still see the customer urgency. So we are losing on price all of the time but I think that if we go back to Chris' guidance, I mean that's solid progress and particularly as I described kind of the macro environment that we -- I guess all have talked about. 
Bill Herbert: Okay. With regard to the cadence of reactivation during the second quarter. Would you describe those as having been relatively evenly distributed over the course of Q2, front end loaded or backend loaded? 
Jeff Miller: I think ratable sort of Q1, Q2. There was no particularly weighting one way or the other. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ange Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.
Ange Sedita: Thanks. Good morning. Certainly an impressive quarter to be your last one, Dave. And you'll certainly be missed and we wish you well in your new role. So on the question, for Jeff or Dave is on the completion of frac intensity. Is it fair to say that you haven't seen that year peak, and if so when you think about North American revenues going into 2018 in a flat rig market, should we still see revenues starting to flatten out as well or could you see still some growth in that revenue cadence with the completion intensity so thoughts on 2018 and its flattening rig market. 
Jeff Miller: Well, Ange, it's too early to call on 2018. What I would say the pace that we see, we see a solid ramp in terms of ability to execute and deliver on the things that we talked about with respect to normalized margins. We do see currently ducks Building, there is back and waiting to activity. And quite frankly the science continues to drive the business. And so I think in terms of peak, the peak is going to be probably more science based in the future and maybe less volume driven. 
Ange Sedita: All right. Fair enough. And then on pricing and pressure pumping. Thoughts on the outlook for pricing as we go into the back half of 2017 and even into 2018. Have you started to see deceleration in recent weeks? And going back to those flat rig market thoughts on pricing in a flat rig market. 
Jeff Miller : So as I said, Ange, I am not going to layout our pricing strategy here on this call by any means. What I would go back to -- we push price all time, our guys, what we do is in high demand. And particularly in a market like we are in now where urgency matters, delivering targets matters to our customers. And that's where high proficiency and the technology that we bring are so valuable. And so I am confident that we are continuing to work. We talked about the leverage that we have in terms of leading edge priced, legacy fleet and then obviously cost and efficiency. So we work on all of those all the time. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. 
Sean Meakim: Hi, good morning. So, Jeff, you made a point and emphasis around sand demand perhaps starting to get smarter. But is it fair to say that service intensity likely continues to increase on average well basis going forward? And how would characterize the rate of change on overall service intensity?
Jeff Miller: Yes that the intensity continues to increase both rate and numbers of stages and those sorts of things. So I think it's more of - I'll bring it up simply because I've always believe that sand, a, is not infinite and it's not free. And so as we started to put constraints on sand in terms of availability cost, it's actually had a very rational impact driving thought around where it goes and how much in terms of total volume. But I'd say in terms of how it gets placed, I talked about it a couple technology examples in my prepared remarks. So those kinds of things the equipment work just as hard but it is how it is applied. So that's I bring that up today. We haven't seen that before really gosh in five years, six years and so it's one data point but it's one that I am certainly going to watch. 
Sean Meakim: Absolutely. And then just I wanted to also touch --based on the acquisition on Summit. Could you give us maybe a little more detail on the expansion strategy for that new business and just as you bring about M&A, is there other tuck-in need that keep filling up that lift portfolio or can you build also Summit here to really get where you think you need to go?
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks, Sean. I mean the Summit deal is fantastic fit and fantastic people, is what I can say about that. I mean it was a great add for our artificial lift business. When we put our business together with Summit, it creates solid number two position and US, ESP, other technology and really loves their value proposition. I mean they are so dialed into how they respond to customers and they build the plumbing around that to do it very, very well. And so the strategy going forward is to use our footprint to create even more value which we know we can do. Starting here in the US but also internationally. We've talked about M&A before and I don't see -- we continue to be interested in growing our production group which includes all forms of lift. Happy with what we've done two on ESP today and then I've also talked about chemicals being probably more organic and less M&A but nevertheless there will be some M&A in that. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. 
Jim Wicklund: Good morning, guys. And Dave it's been a fabulous almost two decades. But you are not going yet so we'll see other than on the conference call but congratulation on a great run. 
Dave Lesar : You are right. I am not gone yet. 
Jim Wicklund: Now we got to bring that that up, make sure everybody understands he is hanging around for 18 more months. Jeff, you made an excellent point on the pricing of international saying that while overall activity is quick going down there is not enough bulk of activity in several markets to really get pricing improvement. Where do you expect to see internationally that the first level of activity getting high enough that we are not giving away price any more and a beginning of recovery?
Jeff Miller: Jim, it's going to be some spot whether as a discovery or there is enough sort of base load of activity to move quickly. If I had to guess there is probably some places in Latin America that might fill that bill. But as far as broad region that's really part of the issue, Jim, it's like peanut butter being spread around the world and gets enough traction in a particular spot. So that's why what makes it tough is simply because it will be very concentrated place when we start to see that. Now, the other side of that, that's one of the reasons we do protect our international franchise. We think that the investment we made over the last several years is valuable and will be more valuable in the future when that time comes but it's not -- yes, I think we are moving side wise for a while. 
Jim Wicklund: And in drilling and evaluation, you note that you had a $150 million increase in revenue but only a $3 million increase in income. And that clearly points to price issues. I am just wondering that you had a seasonal recovery in the North Sea and in Russia and those are two places we normally don't associate with Halliburton being leading edge. Were those two of your better markets or your worse markets? Can you talk about just on the drilling and evaluation side? Where those two markets fit? 
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean on a relative basis relatively smaller but quite frankly very good markets for us. And once I really want to give kudos to Joe Rainey and their team who have absolutely executed and build those businesses. So those are businesses that are in my view gaining traction in the DNA part of our business. Better alignment around customers, I think closer alignment with customers particularly in Russia today and very encouraging. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open.
David Anderson: Great. So, Dave, all the time on the road I think you've earned your downtime. Good luck on your next venture there. So, Jeff, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pricing -- slightly different way, you talked about getting leading edge pricing on your reactivated equipment. But I am curious for your legacy fleets out there. I think that's been one area you have been trying to keep that, you want to keep those relationships there. What's that spread now and the pricing between the legacy and kind of new equipment go on the market and when do you think that's start to close? Is that a year end? Is that kind of 12 months it takes to close that gap? What are your thoughts there?
Jeff Miller: Look, that's something that is closing I'd say sort of everyday as we work it. But let's go back to why there is a spread there. And it's because we are aligning with very good customers, they are very efficient and so we want to be part of their business. And we believe we can do a lot to help drive down sort of their overall cost and lower their cost per BOE. And so that's why we never had -- we abandoned half the market to go move somewhere else. We absolutely want to support all of our customers. So I am not going to give that spread. But I'll tell you it's something like I said in Q1 that we would be closing in on that over four quarters. So look for some time early in 2018 to have that done.
David Anderson: Great. Thanks. And then on -- in terms of your fleet now, what percentage of your rough fleet has your modern Q10 pump out there? And I was wondering if you could extend a little bit upon on that pump and how that changes in terms of the useful life of your equipment versus what's out there in the market? You touched on it before about the attrition out there. But just trying to get kind of senses as to kind of how your equipment is different in the market than other equipment out there and why we should we think about that differently?
Jeff Miller: Yes. So I mean I'd say we are probably in the 60% range or so for the following reactivation. The important thing about that equipment is that it is build for total cost of ownership. I mean we don't sell this equipment in the market. Our guys at Duncan are absolutely motivated by one thing. What is the most resilient, the efficient piece of equipment? And I go out and check to make sure that it's competitively priced which it is, but more important thing is cost is what it does for our guys in the field. And the way that it is integrated. So it runs a higher rate, it uses all the available horsepower, it's more efficient by still about a 20% efficiency compared to what we see in the market. So when I think about how do we make the best returns in the marketplace, we always think about how do we drive capital off of location and first thing to do is have more efficient pumps on location. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC. Your line is now open. 
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning. And Dave congratulation and all the best. So, hey, Jeff, you run up very interesting comment little bit earlier about seeing first quarter here where sand used per well has declined. So wondering if you might be able to elaborate on that a little bit more? Do you sense that as you mentioned that it is truly purely an economic decision? Do you think it's an anomaly? Do you think there is shortage of sand that's driving it? Just kind of get trying to look for little bit more color on what you may be seeing? 
Jeff Miller: Look, I think it's really is part of the science of frac and that is if not the only thing it's not the customers are running from the economics but they are making very thoughtful economic decisions and as the availability or the actually the applicability of science so the better they understand, we collectively understand how to make more barrels. That gives put to work with clearly an economic backdrop. And I think that back to Dave's earlier comments on our customers. I mean this is an incredibly adaptive group of customers that I think it demonstrated through tougher cycle in our history and ability to consume science, consume lesson learned and move the cost per BOE down almost in the face of anything. And so I think what you are seeing is really the nature evolution of, okay as inputs move up for better ways to get more barrels and in some cases we are seeing that. This is not across the board but on overall basis that was the data point we saw. 
Kurt Hallead: Okay, thank you. And just maybe on the international front. I know you mentioned-- use the spreading the peanut butter analogy, but it seems like there is more concentrated increased activity levels going on in Latin America in a number of different countries. Do you feel like you could get pricing power moving in right direction in Latin America before some other region? 
Jeff Miller: Well, again I am not going to get our strategy around price anywhere but what I'd say Latin America is not too different in terms of the contract cycle terms of -- length of contracts typically have a muting impact. There is plenty of -- quite a bit of equipment in the world today and so certainly look forward to that but I'd not -- it's not enough to change the overall trajectory. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Waqar Syed: Thank you. And Dave congratulation again and you'll be certainly missed and your comments would be missed greatly on the calls. My question relates to the Permian sand that's been recently got FERC's, a new capacity additions have been announced and there is good chance that prices are going to fall quietly sharply in the Permian for EMP companies there. What impact does that have for pressure pumping companies as sand prices fall in the Permian? Is it neutral or is it negative or positive? And then also how do you think about your own investment in Trans loading and rail transportation? Would that change if most of the sand is regionally sourced? 
Jeff Miller: Look, that's great for us. It's good for our customers. It's good for us in terms of lowering cost per BOE. I've been very vocal about why we don't own mines and that's -- this is an example of why not bring it from Halliburton standpoint, why we wouldn't want to be invested and tied, was not cost to places, technology moves a different direction. Trans load infrastructure that we have is valuable. I'd say probably the toughest part to get to realistically is the Permian basin and local sand in my view opens up a whole new avenue of what is lower cost. And some of the things that we are doing around delivering sand. We are always looking at how do we get sand delivered at a lower cost point and I think our containerized solutions that we are implementing are right, right in the sweet spot of that kind of development.
Waqar Syed: Okay. And you don't see -- are there any long -term negative implications of -- cost implications for railcars or other things that you may have leased? Or the industry may have leased? 
Jeff Miller: No. I mean that's the stuff works all over the country and that's fairly localized solution. So I like what we are invested in. And we've always been careful. Again, we target about 50% of our capacities manage internally. And we do that so that we can flex with the market. And that's how I see this. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Ole Slorer: Thank you very much. And again, Dave, congratulation for the very solid runs at Halliburton. Jeff, question to you again regarding kind of the sand logistics and the changes in completion again. I mean before you highlighted that at Halliburton doesn't really have any interest in owning sand but once the fork is on the logistics because of the changing nature of the type of proppants, that's preferred. So could you talk a little bit about the kind of capacity thing added at the moment in West Texas is kind of 100 mesh largely some 470 and address that in context of other proppants, how you see the mix evolving? And how that impacts Halliburton?
Jeff Miller: Well, look, we are in large part agnostic to the type of sand, the reality is we study sand closely to understand how to better design chemistry to make better frac. Cost is always a component of that. But we've seen other media sort of go into vogue and out of vogue and we've got mark risk out which is an NO style solution or micro style solution. So I think that obviously what's being talked about today is consistent with what I hear from customers. And what is being consumed today. But again that the drive for better science is always going on and that's one of the reasons our labs are constantly looking at, how to take what's available and make it better and how to either or to substitute with things that are better. So I think just the answer [Multiple Speakers] is inappropriate. 
Ole Slorer: So the reduction that you saw on a per well basis. Was that a function of shortages and sand pricing and therefore forcing industry to adopt different methods or do you see this trend continuing even it's kind of sand gets the bottlenecked? 
Jeff Miller: Well, it's one data point so I will clearly be watching that. Since that I get this more around design and what is the most -- our clients are dead focused on lowest cost per BOE, making more barrels and at a lower cost. And so designing things that can consume less sand but deliver more barrels or as many barrels is clearly what they want to do. 
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Miller for any closing remarks. 
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Candice. Before we close, there are a couple points I'd like to highlight. First, our second quarter performance demonstrates strength of our North American franchise and our ability to adapt to rapidly changing environment. Second, Halliburton's relative performance for the balance of this year will remain strong as a result of our ability to grow North America margins and maintain revenue and margins internationally. Look forward to talking with you next quarter. Candice, you may now close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2017 earnings call. At this time, all participants are a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lance Loeffler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Lance Loeffler - Halliburton Co.: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2017 conference call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me this morning are Jeff Miller, President; and Robb Voyles, Interim CFO. As mentioned on our last quarterly call, due to a long-standing business commitment, Dave Lesar, Halliburton's Chairman and CEO, will not be present this morning but will return for our second quarter call. Today, Jeff will be providing market and operational commentary; and Robb will discuss our quarterly financial results. As a reminder, from our fourth quarter earnings call, we have changed the reporting for our divisions in geographic regions consistent with our major peer. In doing so, we will now provide revenue and profit for our divisions and revenue only for our four geographic regions: North America; Latin America; Europe/Africa/CIS; and Middle East/Asia. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures, and unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of certain items which consists of impairments and other charges, a class-action lawsuit settlement, and loss on debt extinguishment. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release, which can be found on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Thank you, Lance, and good morning, everyone. We are the execution company, focused on achieving industry-leading returns. I'm thankful to the Halliburton team around the world for their consistent execution and for collaborating and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers in every single market where we operate. Now, following our operational update a few weeks ago, the quarter wrapped up in line with what we expected. Our highlights for the quarter were total company revenue of $4.3 billion, representing a 6% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. I'm pleased that our U.S. land revenue increased by nearly 30%, outperforming the average sequential U.S. land rig count growth of 27%. And total North America revenue was up 24% sequentially, significantly outperforming our largest peer. Latin America revenue grew in excess of 8% sequentially, outperforming what is typically a seasonal decline following year-end product sales. Operating income was $203 million, primarily driven by improving market conditions in North America, which were partially offset by activity declines and pricing pressure internationally. We completed the early redemption of $1.4 billion of senior notes during the quarter using cash on hand, reducing both leverage and interest expense going forward. As we described in our operational update, the market is a tale of two cycles. North America activity increased rapidly but not without growing pains, while activity in the rest of the world declined due to typical seasonal pressures that were exacerbated by current cyclical headwinds. In North America, the first quarter brought a lot of change, both to our strategy and our customers' view of the market. And I love the way the market is shaping up. I'm excited because customers are investing to meet production targets; pricing is moving; supply versus demand dynamics are tight; our reactivated equipment is going to work at leading-edge pricing, and we are working to manage our input costs. So, we said we would outgrow the U.S. land market, and we did. The cost and benefits of our reactivation program continue as we march into the second quarter. And to be crystal clear, we're adding reactivated equipment at market-leading prices to stabilize market share. At the same time, we're repairing margins in the rest of the portfolio. North America incremental margins improved throughout the quarter in spite of absorbing transitory inflation costs, reactivation costs, and typical seasonal declines in the Gulf of Mexico. In short, our first quarter results reflect that we are not chasing market share at the cost of pricing. Our strategy to deliver industry-leading returns is at the center of everything we do. We see the path to normalized margins and know it's better to invest now to maintain hard-earned market share, so that when we earn normalized margins, it will be on a bigger base of business. We still think this is the smart choice and the right choice. While production increases could moderate the pace of activity increases in the second half of the year, we see sufficient demand for the equipment we're bringing into the market. As we look at the second half of the year, we'll assess our options for continued redeployment beyond our current plans, but have made no decisions. Because we build our own equipment, we have the unique luxury to wait longer than our competitors to make any new build decisions. We believe that the industry's active fleet of pumping equipment is fully utilized. And we know from our own experience, as we get near the bottom of the stacked equipment pile, it will be progressively harder and more expensive for the industry to reactivate equipment. Our experience through many cycles is that when this happens, we see a customer flight to quality due to their strong desire to make better wells and reduce their cost per BOE. Let me reiterate, we foresee increased demand for new build equipment, but will not consider responding to this demand until the economics make sense. What's important is that we see multiple paths to normalized margins, and we'll maintain optionality to travel the path that gets us there the fastest with the highest market share. The following factors influence our decision on which path to choose: determining where and how we add equipment at leading-edge pricing; chasing price up, not down; evaluating, winding up, and repairing pricing on older contracts, this is happening every day; aligning with customers that are racing to meet production targets or will work with us to maximize our collective efficiency; managing our input costs; and finally, a relentless focus on reducing internal costs and implementing technology. Outside of North America, our more conservative outlook for the last several quarters is proving accurate. Our customers around the world have different breakeven thresholds and production requirements, but none are immune to the impacts of the current commodity price environment. We continue to see customers defer new projects, most notably in the offshore exploration markets. Now due to lower cash flow and project economics, they are more focused than ever on lowering costs. The result of this combination is less activity and more pricing pressure. Now I believe the first quarter represents the bottom in the Eastern Hemisphere rig count. The full-year average for 2017 will likely only be marginally higher than the full-year average for 2016. Further, due to the long-term contractual nature of international markets and the level of continuing price pressure, I expect discounts will offset activity gains over the near term. In Latin America, we saw sequential improvement in revenue from activity in Brazil and Mexico in the first quarter. Now while we're seeing an improvement in certain basins, there are a variety of country-specific headwinds that must be overcome for a meaningful recovery in the region. In contrast to North America, where we believe that a $50 oil price would drive a significant increase in activity, customers tell me that longer duration international markets will react less to an absolute oil price but more to a positive view of where price will be for several years. This isn't a surprise given the longer investment cycle that many of our customers face. To sum it up, in North America the momentum is building, and we only see it getting better. And we believe we've seen the bottom in the international market. Now I'll turn the call to Robb to cover our financial results.
Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Thanks, Jeff. Good morning. Let's start with a summary of our first quarter results compared sequentially to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $4.3 billion, representing an increase of 6%, while operating income was $203 million. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in our North America land business, offset by the typical seasonal impact in the international markets that were exacerbated by the cyclical headwinds that Jeff described earlier. Now let me compare our divisional results to the fourth quarter of 2016. In our Completion and Production division, first quarter revenue increased by 15% while operating income increased 73%. These results were primarily driven by improved pressure pumping pricing and utilization in our U.S. land business, offset by a seasonal decline in completion tool sales across the Eastern Hemisphere and the Gulf of Mexico. Turning to our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income declined by 4% and 51% respectively, primarily as a result of reduced software sales as well as lower pricing and decreased fluid sales across the Middle East-Asia region. Let me take a minute to compare our geographic results. In North America, revenue increased 24% sequentially, primarily driven by increased pricing and activity in our pressure pumping and well construction product service lines. In Latin America, we saw revenue increase by 8%, primarily due to increased activity in well completion, fluid services, and production solutions in Brazil, as well as pressure pumping, fluid services, and project management in Mexico. Turning to Europe-Africa-CIS, revenue declined 11%, resulting primarily from reduced activity in West Africa and weather-related activity reductions in the North Sea and Russia. For Middle East-Asia, revenue declined 12% as a result of reduced pricing and activity across the region, particularly completion tool sales, project management, and drilling services. Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $66 million in the first quarter, and we anticipate that our corporate expenses will be a similar amount for the second quarter of 2017. In March 2017, we redeemed $1.4 billion of our senior notes with cash on hand. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $104 million on the early extinguishment of debt, which included the redemption premium and a write-off of the remaining original debt issuance costs and debt discount, partially offset by a gain from the termination of related interest rate swap agreements. This loss on the early debt extinguishment is included in the $242 million of interest expense for the first quarter. As a function of our reduced debt balance, we expect net interest expense for the second quarter to be approximately $120 million, a savings of close to $20 million. This savings will continue in future quarters. We reported $18 million of other expenses for the quarter. This was lower than we anticipated due to lower volatility associated with foreign exchange movements during the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in slightly higher than expected at approximately 27%, due to a shift in the geographic mix of our earnings. For the remainder of 2017, we are expecting the effective tax rate to be approximately 29% to 30%. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was approximately $5 million, which represents $340 million of cash flow from operations, excluding the final Macondo payment. And we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and equivalents. As we progress through 2017, we believe we are well-positioned to generate significantly more cash from operations. Turning now to our near-term operational outlook. Market dynamics continue to make forecasting a challenge, but let me provide you with some comments on how we believe the second quarter is shaping up. For our Drilling and Evaluation division, we are anticipating a second quarter rebound from typical seasonal weather disruptions in drilling activity, such that sequential revenue will experience a mid-single-digit increase compared to first quarter levels, with margins increasing 75 basis points to 125 basis points. In our Completion and Production division, we believe that revenues will increase in the upper teens, while margins will increase by 275 basis points to 325 basis points. As for our regional outlook, as in the first quarter, we expect our revenue growth in North America to outperform the average U.S. land rig count growth, which is already up significantly for the second quarter. In Latin America, we anticipate revenues will increase sequentially by mid-single digits. We expect Europe/Africa/CIS revenues to increase by low-double digits as a result of increased activity after the winter months. And we believe Middle East/Asia revenue will remain relatively flat sequentially. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for a technology review and a few closing comments. Jeff?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: As I said earlier, our strategy is to deliver leading shareholder returns. That shapes all of the decisions that we make. We work closely with our customers, and what we do is clearly aligned with what's most important to them, delivering oil and gas at the lowest cost per BOE, even more so in what is a challenging commodity price environment. We execute our strategy with three main levers, and those levers are: people; capital investment; and technology. Each is pointed towards generating leading returns. Our people collaborate, listen and use a broad range of technology to engineer solutions. I know this is working, because it wins with our customers. We have leading service quality that translates into larger work allocations and contract awards, which ultimately result in higher market share. Our capital investment strategy is absolutely focused on the things that competitively differentiate us. For example, we are always developing solutions that drive capital off location and make us more efficient. In hydraulic fracturing, we already make the most efficient pumps and have the most efficient surface configuration. What you probably don't know is that we're doing the same thing in all other parts of our business. For example, our subsea intervention systems are more compact. Our rotary coring tool is the ultra-deepwater market leader; and our state-of-the-art completions tools manufacturing allow us to design and deliver lower-cost tools. We have continuous improvement initiatives across all of the company to maximize the efficiency of our capital investment. From a mergers and acquisitions perspective, we're interested in acquiring businesses and technologies that enhance the depth of our product line portfolio or breadth of our offering in specific areas, such as production chemicals and artificial lift. As we're a returns-focused company, we do not want to get into product lines that we believe would be dilutive to our return profile, such as subsea equipment. There are good companies in this industry segment that we can partner with to provide those capabilities to our customers without diluting our returns. Our customers are more open to technology adoption than ever before and continuously engage with us to help direct our technology investment. I believe that technology is valuable when it satisfies two criteria: first, it meets the customer requirement; and then, second, it provides a return to Halliburton. We look for technology and equipment that differentiates us from our competitors, helps our customers, and drives our returns. If it doesn't, we'd rather rent it than own it or partner with an expert in that field. We believe differentiated technology and ability to integrate technology using an open-architecture approach is what sets us apart from our competitors, helps our customers, and drives returns. Through the downturn, we've been very active, deepening those investments and relationships that we believe offer the best full-cycle returns. Our competitive technology position is demonstrated by our onshore market leadership in North America and our contract awards and share gains in what are historically some of the most technology-driven markets, such as deepwater exploration with openhole wireline and testing; deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where Halliburton now enjoys an overall market leadership position; and, finally, in the Middle East, where we have a market leadership position in project management. The feedback from our customers has been overwhelming. We're aligned with what's most important to them, maximizing asset value, and doing so with our proven commitment to execution service quality and technology. Now, because we provided an operational update a month ago, we have a few spare minutes today to cover topics we don't normally have time to discuss. I hear a lot of discussion in the industry today about digital initiatives, for example, big data, analytics, Internet of Things, and automation. And I'd like to share my views on the subject. Let's start with the underlying concept. Our industry challenges remain the same, but today, we have an opportunity to solve problems in a fundamentally different way, enabled by the development of reliable, inexpensive sensors, data processing capabilities in the cloud, and advances in machine learning techniques. Now, digital technologies are valuable, only when they solve a problem. The value is created by the combination of domain expertise with digital technologies. Arguably, the most popular talking point is big data. Now, big data standing alone is nothing but big data collection. It's really only valuable when used for automation and optimization. To me, the big data story is still being written. We collect different E&P data types, and because Landmark's DecisionSpace is the go-to platform for the industry, we power the collection and storage of big data more so than anyone else. Our customers use DecisionSpace to collect, monitor, analyze, and sometimes control their assets through the life of the field. Each customer is unique and will have specific goals. The open-architecture platform we provide allows customization and enables customers to use their domain expertise to its fullest advantage. Let me give you some other examples of what digital looks like at Halliburton, starting with the direct application of these innovations to help customers lower their cost per BOE. In the production space, we're a leader in smart fields, with Voice of the Oilfield, where digital technologies are combined with subsurface understanding to optimize production. In the Eastern Hemisphere, we have completed the first phase of the smart field project in heavy oil. The project included modeling, automated workflows, and optimizing production and injection networks. This is made possible by the incorporation of new data sources into an analytical framework. This allowed our customer to have a constant view of their facilities, reservoir, and operations to monitor and optimize production in real-time. This project has substantially reduced the cost of production, and the process is now being implemented on a series of fields with over 1,000 wells. We have similar projects ongoing with major operators in deepwater as well as unconventionals. In hydraulic fracturing, we continue to innovate and push the envelope by automating the fracturing process. This is accomplished by acquiring data from frac treatments in real-time and applying machine learning to make decisions previously taken by on-site personnel, such as rate or pressure adjustments, and volume, and timing the release of materials. As a result, we've seen dramatic improvements in fracture efficiencies in the field. We have similar efforts ongoing in our Drilling and Completion arenas, which I'm excited about and will share details about at a later date. Internally, we are far along in rolling out various digital initiatives. For example, in the area of condition-based maintenance, over 90% of our pumps are equipped with IntelliScan, advanced sensors and algorithms to measure and monitor pump health in real-time. In summary, our industry is in the very early stages of defining the digital story. We believe an open digital architecture is a prerequisite for our industry to enable faster innovation and collaboration with our customers. This is why we've invested in and standardized on the industry's only open-standards-based platform, DecisionSpace. We're excited to open up access to this platform code through OpenEarth, a community of E&P scientists and developers, to speed up and lower the cost of digital innovation for the entire industry. In closing, there are a few things that I want to highlight. We are the execution company, and I'm excited by the activity I see in North America. We outperformed the U.S. land rig count in North America and expect to do so again in the second quarter. As we stated on our operational update, we've nearly doubled our reactivated equipment additions for the full year and are bringing that equipment out in the first six months of the year. Our conservative international view is playing out, and I am confident in our ability to handle the challenges in these markets. We are focused on achieving industry-leading returns, and I believe we have the best strategy to achieve that. Now let's open it up for questions.
Operator: And our first question comes from David Anderson of Barclays. Your line is now open.
David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great and thanks. Good morning, Jeff.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Good morning, Dave.
David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So I was just wondering. So with a strong catch-up in completion activity that you saw on U.S. land this quarter, is it fair to say you think we're entering a new completion-intensive phase of this cycle? And I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you see that relationship between rigs and completion activity now. You had previously talked about 900 being the new 2,000 in terms of full industry utilization. I was just wondering if you could go into that math a little bit and see if that's adjusted at all.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Thanks, Dave. There's no doubt that the pace of completions activity is catching up with the rig count, and we expect to see that relationship continue into next quarter most certainly. And it is partly around – the increasing intensity continues to build. And when I said 900 was the new 2,000, I probably overshot that number in a sense that we are seeing that kind of tightness in the marketplace today.
David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And as a related, as we're talking about preserving market share that you've talked about and reactivating it, clearly you did this. I've seen some of this capacity from smaller competitors out there. There are two questions around that. I guess one, what do you think are the biggest impediments for the industry bringing this back? Do you think there's going to be shortages of repair? Is it finding and training crews? Is it something else? And secondarily, you had talked in your prepared remarks about a flight to quality. I was just wondering if we're starting to see that yet. Are customers starting to experience the poor jobs or equipment delivery delays, or is that a little bit further out?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Look, the flight to quality is happening, and that is what we see when equipment comes into the market. And most importantly, as clients get urgent, reliability, service quality, and technology even matter more. And so we are confident that that pivot to what we deliver will continue through the marketplace. As far as things that are tight, equipment broadly is tight I think for the industry today. Sand is one of those things that will recover in terms of availability. There's a lot of capacity coming into the market. And then from a people perspective, we're confident with where we are on people. And it is partly because we retained our folks, our most experienced people through the downturn, and we know how to hire folks. We hired 21,000 in 2014.
David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning, guys.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Good morning, Jim.
Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Good morning, Jim.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I actually heard an advertisement on the radio the other day here in Dallas for a Halliburton job fair in Abilene. So that's the first time I've heard that, so I guess your hiring efforts are going farther afield than Midland.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yes.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: The Gulf of Mexico, my sources are telling me, Jeff, that you guys have just won some work from Chevron and Shell in the Gulf of Mexico that previously had been held by a competitor. And you guys are a little bit smaller in the Gulf of Mexico than your nearest competitor. And I was wondering if you could tell us if this is true, who it is, and how did you do it?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: I'm not going to tell you about customers, but I think we know what the customer set is in the Gulf of Mexico. Yes, we've been quite successful in the Gulf of Mexico, and it's really built around our strategy, Jim. It's collaborating and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers, so we're clearly focused on the things that are important to them. And the other thing I think it tells you is that our technology portfolio is extremely competitive. And I think we've demonstrated that by what we're doing in deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico and in other places.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And if I could follow up on the U.S., you guys said in your operational update that you're definitely accelerating pressure pumping capacity. Would it be fair to say that in Q3, you'd probably have about twice as much pressure pumping capacity in the field than you had on January 1? And I know that new contracts are getting a big price hike. I think you all confirmed something close to 25% for Q1. Would all the equipment you have in the field be benefiting from that higher price by say Q3?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Jim, I think the amount of equipment that we're adding is not nearly as much as you're suggesting. But what I will tell you is that we are working constantly on the broader portfolio. And without giving you a time, we actually have seen quite a bit of progress on that since the beginning of the year. I can't predict precisely what that timing is, but the right things are happening. And I'd say that in the sense of customer urgency, we're seeing that supply and demand tightness. And the bottom line is we really like the way the market's shaping up. I think we're on that path.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I guess what I'm really asking though is that, I know that new fleets are going to work at a nice price hike from where we were, say, exiting Q4, but the equipment that you already had in the field in Q4, how long does it take before the new prices for new equipment, how long before that price hike hits all the legacy activity and equipment you already have in the field, how long should that take to flow through?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Again, that should happen over the next, I would say, four quarters, somewhere in that range depending on pace and efficiency of customers. But it's something that gets done in due course as contracts roll over, or we move things around. So we kind of control the when, and the where, and the how. We work on that every day, Jim.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Is this new equipment going to work on contract, or just more like commitment?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Jim, everyone would like to commit equipment at this point in the marketplace. I think we're being very thoughtful about where we place equipment. We are aligned with the right customers, we believe, in the right markets. But we also move equipment around, and that's part of where we see the flight to quality happen as we move equipment around.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from James West of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
James West - Evercore ISI: Hey, good morning, guys.
Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Good morning.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Good morning.
James West - Evercore ISI: Jeff, as you think about the second half of the year in North America, given all the equipment you've put back to work and the pricing power that you're achieving now, what do you see as the momentum of North American margins going forward? I know we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here, but incremental margins were, as you have talked about previously, light this quarter, but they should, in my mind, at least explode in the back half. Is that a fair assessment? I mean, when you're running your models and you're thinking about your earnings power here for North America, what do you see?
Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Jim, this is Robb. I'm not sure about what you would characterize explosion, but...
James West - Evercore ISI: Fair enough, Robb.
Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: ...this is a transition quarter for us in terms of how we're reporting our operating income in areas. But given that it is a transition, and given the way North America's rapidly expanding, what I can say is that margins improved throughout the quarter, and that our exit incrementals for North America approximated what we'd anticipated for the whole quarter. We really like the momentum that we see going into the second quarter, and we fully anticipate that momentum to continue throughout the year.
James West - Evercore ISI: Okay, okay. That's helpful, Robb. Thanks. And Robb and Jeff, I saw you guys about what, five, six weeks ago or so and at that time, we were starting to talk about new build capacity. And Jeff, I believe, that you had indicated that you would probably make that call as we got closer to kind of mid-year. I suspect you and Robb, too, probably have Jim Brown in your office every day asking for CapEx and trying to build new equipment. So how are you thinking about that right now? And how are you thinking about when you make that decision to start adding incremental capacity, think about new builds to the market?
Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Well, fortunately, Jim Brown lives in Denver, and he can't be in our office.
James West - Evercore ISI: Sorry calling you, yeah.
Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Well, we also have the call ID, so we don't always answer the phone. But I think what we were trying to make clear in our prepared remarks is that we have not made that decision yet. We're constantly monitoring the situation, looking closely at capacity in the marketplace, our customer relationships and what their demands are. Bottom line is we're not going to be bringing new build equipment into the market unless and until we see the kind of margins that we want to achieve, and that's normalized margins and a good return on that equipment. We're fortunate, as you know, in that we manufacture our own equipment. And so we've got a lot of optionality in that area, and we can react rapidly when we need to. But at this point, we're comfortable with where we are, and we've not made any decisions on new builds.
James West - Evercore ISI: Okay, fair enough. All right, thanks, Robb.
Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Thanks. Good morning. So on the guidance, it looks like the incremental for the second quarter for CPS is in the vicinity of like 25%. And I'm just curious as to when you conducted your call of a few weeks back on the operational update, Dave talked about aspirational North America margins over the course of the next several quarters and then a couple of years in the 20% arena. And in order to do that, we had to land kind of a sort of glide path of 40% to 45% sequential incrementals for several quarters. And I'm just curious, with regard to CPS, I think you guys had an 18% incremental Q1, a guided 25% incremental for Q2. And relative to that aspired 40% to 45% North American incremental, what do CPS incrementals have to be in order to land that 20% North America margin?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Bill, I think the outlook we gave on the operational update is accurate. But without a precise number, what we need to do is continue to put the equipment to work that we have in the marketplace. And I expect that we will be on a glide path that will materialize over the balance of the year that take us to what those normalized margins are and should be seeing that reflected as we, again, move through the second half of the year and into next year.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Okay. And just my takeaway from the call a few weeks back is that what was burdening your incrementals was a combination of insufficient net pricing traction, one; second, ramp-up and reactivation friction; and third, supply chain cost inflation. And I'm just curious as if you could talk briefly about each of those with regard to how we're evolving, and sort of progressing, and transcending those challenges, and what we can expect.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: So with respect to bringing equipment back out, I mean, we laid out the path to these assets through sort of mid-year. And at that point, that burden is behind us. With respect to supply chain, and we were working on that every single day, that in many ways, the short-term supply shortages that were at least generated by year-end activity should begin to abate as we move through Q2. This is sand shortages. And so those are the most prominent couple of items that come under control as we move through the year.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: And with regard to net pricing traction, I think, an earlier questioner said 25% on new equipment rolling out. Is that correct? And what kind of pricing traction are you getting with regard to equipment in the field currently working?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yes. I mean, there's great momentum. So we talked about moving up at the leading edge, but we're seeing pricing improvement in every basin where we work around North America. And as I said, on the legacy portfolio, it is getting traction. And as we work that every day, again, it is making progress. And we expect that, that momentum continues as we work through the year.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Good morning.
Robb L. Voyles - Halliburton Co.: Good morning, Scott.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I want to follow on from Bill's question. I think we all understand that margins should improve nicely in the second half of the year as these restart costs fade, but do you need additional pricing to reach those 20% plus normalized margins in North America, or can you get there through the repricing of active spreads and reaching full utilization? I realize you're not going to be reporting geomarket margins anymore, but conceptually, color on this point, I think would help us all forecast.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yes, so we would expect to continue to make pricing gains. But with that said, there are a lot of other levers that we have once we start to move the full portfolio up on pricing, and that's where we start to get into the customer urgency that we're seeing, which then leads to hyper-utilization. As the excess capacity comes out of the marketplace, we get a lot more control over the calendar, some would call that calendar power, and we don't have all of that today. But I think all of those things conspire to a path to normalized margins that is somewhat dependent on price to the degree it repairs the portfolio. But if we think back to 2014, as we were moving up that chain, we nearly never got to what I would call the pricing power piece of that, but it was more around utilization.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. So just to be clear, you would need some incremental pricing above and beyond leading edge to get to those normalized margins? Is that fair?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yeah, I mean, some at leading edge but, more importantly, repairing the broader portfolio.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And just a follow-up on strategy. We heard from your largest competitor on Friday regarding their strategy to enter various aspects of the value chain in North America. Can you provide an update regarding your strategy toward investing across the value chain and broader integration in North America? Has anything changed as some of the different links in that chain start to tighten?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: No. I mean, we want to invest in those things where we believe we add unique value to them, so clearly, that's our equipment, and the kind of technology we can roll out to make that more efficient. As we look up and down the value chain, we try to be fairly surgical about those things that we think we need to own, one of those being the logistics piece of that, just because it's quite portable, actually, in terms of where sand is at any point in time. We don't have that experience, but our view of owning the actual commodity is that sand is rarely in the right place or is at the right mesh size. Those tastes change over time, and so that's not a place where we want to put a lot of capital.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it, appreciate the color.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Good morning, Angie.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: So Jeff, going back to the construction comments that you made in your prepared remarks and the Q&A here, you said that given that you build in-house, you can wait longer before you start to build. Can you give us a little perspective of your construction time for that equipment? And has the cost structure changed from building this cycle versus the last cycle?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: I would say that we've seen the cost come down somewhat around the cost of building equipment. As we look out at what's available or what we can do in the marketplace, I think also some of that's our own value engineering as we think about how we take cost out of things and still achieve the same effective market-leading equipment. With respect to timing, I'm not going to give you the precise timing, but it is going to be faster than anyone else, simply because we control that part of the value chain in our manufacturing facility. And that allows us to make no decision, certainly at this time. And I think we can wait fairly deep into the cycle before we make any kind of decision about whether or not we bring out new equipment.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then on the cost pass-throughs, correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought a third of your sand that you're purchasing on the spot market. And can you talk about the lag in passing through the cost to your customers? And are you seeing any challenges, at least maybe on your legacy equipment on getting the cost pass-throughs fully redeemed?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Look, that's very competitive in terms around how we work with each of our customers, and they're different. What we do see is a path to manage inflation. And I do think in addition to that, some element of that inflation will abate as we get into the later half of the year.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. And then finally on pricing, besides frac and maybe directional drilling, are you seeing pricing gains in any other product lines?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: We are seeing pricing gains in the well construction service lines. However, those never fell quite as far, and so I don't think they have as far to move back up. But we are seeing, certainly, tightness in some of those service lines.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: Okay, great. Thanks, I'll turn it over.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to just touch base on your international outlook. Jeff, you mentioned in your comments something regarding operator budgets. The absolute oil price may be not as important as perception on stability and where it's going to be for the next several quarters. If we're in a $50 to $55 world for an extended period, what is your sense on, number one, how international revenue would progress? But then also how do we think about your margins in that environment as well? It sounds like price pressure continues in certain areas. Can you maybe talk about revenue outlook in a low to mid-$50 type environment, and how we could think about your international margins perhaps over the back half of the year and maybe on a longer-term basis?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: I think what we see is the stress in that part of the market is simply a cost piece of the issue. And so how do we bring cost down to make a lot of those plays more competitive? And I think our customers are working on that now, but doesn't change the macro view that as North America is more competitive, where does that put some of these other markets? And our strategy is working with our customers, but it works slowly and in terms of bringing that cost down. So as we look out, I think it will be muted in a range-bound world, that deepwater will be the slowest to come back. I think there is room to move around in the mature fields, and I think those will recover probably ahead of that in terms of activity, which is what we're seeing through the balance of the year. But it is very competitive given the amount of equipment that is out around the world today.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right, thanks for that. And just to follow up on that, as we think about your international businesses, do you have other levers you could pull if revenue outlook is perhaps flat for a period and you make that determination? Do you have other levers you can pull to get your international margins higher to adjust for a new normal, if it comes to that?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yes, we do. We are constantly working on continuous improvement initiatives that take cost out of not only the business but also out of the equipment that we use. There are all kinds of breakthroughs as we look at how to make things work more effectively. When I talk about our value proposition and how we collaborate and engineer solutions, a lot of that is how do we systematically take cost out of what we do, which ultimately improves our margins.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then just my follow-up is on North America. It's been asked a little bit, and I wanted to try take it from a different angle. If I were to think about your portfolio today in the U.S. in pressure pumping, is there a way to think about, I don't know, what percentage would be at leading-edge pricing, and then trying to think about how much is still under legacy pricing if I were to think about where it is today?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Look, it's moving all of the time. So I'm really not, from a competitive standpoint, sharing with you where we are specifically. What I will tell you is that it's all moving up but in different paces, as commitments roll off and as new opportunities come along. What I would tell you though is that the entire fleet is on that path moving up and to the right. What percentage of that, we will work through that through the balance of the year.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. High-level question for me on North America. In the last cycle, you had your SandKing systems that delivered tremendous efficiencies to the industry. And today, we're seeing a range of third-party last-mile and storage systems come into the industry of North America that delivers increased efficiency cycle-over-cycle for sand logistics. In the last cycle, the infrastructure broke down around 50 million tons, 60 million tons, it might have been north of that. You can clearly handle more. But I'd like to have your view on what the bottleneck that creep into the industry will be, and when they should hit, and when do you think that will become evident? What are the other black swans, in other words? Could you offer us that, Jeff?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: I think, Ole, the definition of a black swan is we don't see it, but the...
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, the grey swans then.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: The grey swans. Look, I think that the industry has demonstrated ability to overcome all of these. And that's one of the reasons that I'm very careful about how we invest in those things and what part of it that we own. I think that logistics will get tight, and it probably gets tight over the balance of the year. I like where we are in that place particularly because of our investment in logistics, and rail, and all that goes with that, so confident there. Then I think about getting the cost out, you referenced how we handle sand and move it around. I think the containerized solutions are going to be very good. I think they'll remove a lot of demurrage and allow us to move more sand more quickly. That's an example of technology having an impact. The other people and whatnot, I really do think is quite manageable, but with investment and the infrastructure that knows how to hire them, train them and put equipment to work.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: You highlighted investment in a new coil tubing system, for example. Are there other product lines that because of changes in relative science or new ways of doing things could become problematic?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: No. I mean, I think, we're in the market all the time. So I tried to walk you through some of how we view technology and how we approached that, but I think we are very effective in the market at addressing those things that if we want to invest in them, and we think that they create value for us, we can. And we do those things that we feel like are going to be commoditized over time, or also the rents don't clearly accrue to us. I mean, that's another area where it may be better to partner with someone and not tie capital up where those rents don't accrue to us. And we've seen that over time.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Oh, and I would totally agree with that. The bottleneck might be very short in life, so I was more thinking about industry bottlenecks as opposed to Halliburton-specific bottlenecks.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yeah, and I mean, as I said, I think it'll be around people over time. Talking about North America, will be challenging to get staffed up. And I do think logistics, overtime, will get tight, I do think so.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just one follow-up on Iraq. You've put in your press release, a commentary that you're going back to work for Shell. Could you give us your view on activity in Iraq, in particular? The rig count has come down a lot, and those service companies talking about Iraq anymore. What's going on in terms of investments into the existing fields and infrastructure there?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yeah, so I would say from a pay standpoint, it's kind of steady as she goes. What we like about it is our position in that market and the success that we've had with project management. And that's been a launch pad for us to kind of move that model more effectively into other parts of the Middle East and other parts of the world. So we like our position in that market. The Middle East, overall, has been generally resilient, but again, from our standpoint, important piece of business.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Good morning, Sean.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So, Jeff, could you maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of competitive dynamics between the basins in North America? So at this point, are things materially different for Halliburton in the Permian versus, say, the Bakken and Eagle Ford, or maybe there's less incremental activity so far but also for your competitors?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Well, we've stayed invested in all of the basins throughout all of the cycles, and so we feel like it's important that we're there, that we have the basin expertise to work in all those basins. So we're, and to a certain degree, basin agnostic in terms of how we are positioned. Now, clearly, the Permian Basin's got the most activity. I mean, you see all of those things. Look, I like the way we're positioned in each market.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, fair enough. Is it fair to say that you're back to working mostly all your fleets at 24/7 operation to this point?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Yes, fleets are busy. We're starting to see even sort of the calendar firm up around customers with more than one rig and those sorts of things, which again, all inspire to help improve utilization.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. And then just on international, you talked about better cash generation expectation the next couple of quarters. Assuming with international customers, where are you still seeing challenges, and where are you going to get traction in terms of collections?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: I think generally seeing, with the exception of a few countries, we're seeing collections improving, not where they were at the end of the last cycle, but we see a path, we've got a great organization to connect with our customers and expect to see working capital continue to improve over the balance of the year. Thank you.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Yes. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jeff Miller for closing remarks.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - Halliburton Co.: Thank you, Candice. Look, I'd like to wrap up the call with a couple of key points. First, we're excited about the way North America's shaping up and believe that we'll outgrow the rig count in North America. Our reactivated equipment is going to work at leading-edge market pricing, while we wind up and repair pricing on our legacy portfolio. And these are marking the path towards normalized margins. Now, while our more conservative international view is playing out, the international rig count has bottomed. And our strategy to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value is absolutely aligned with what's most important to our customers. I'm confident that our team can handle the challenges in these markets. And so with that, thank you, and I look forward to talking with you next quarter. Candice, please close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Lance Loeffler, Halliburton’s Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2016 conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton’s website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Jeff Miller, President; and Mark McCollum, CFO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other securities and exchange commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures, and unless otherwise noted in our discussion, we will be excluding the impact of impairments and other charges and a class action lawsuit settlement. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter press release, which can be found on our website. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Lance and good morning to everyone. Never before in my nearly 40 years in and around the oil and gas industry have I seen a more difficult year for the industry. The down cycle in the 1980s was bad, but 2016 represented the sharpest and deepest industry decline in history. However, today, I’m really excited about what I see happening. Now, we came through 2016 in pretty good shape. First, I want to highlight a few of our 2016 accomplishments. We finished the year with total Company revenue of nearly $16 billion and adjusted operating income of $690 million. And once again, we believe we outpaced our primary competitor in growing our market share. We generated significant cash flow from operating activities during the second half of the year and increased our cash position for the full year. We successfully completed our structural cost initiatives and were able to cut more than a $1 billion in costs out of our business. Now for some fourth quarter highlights. I believe, we had a fantastic quarter in executing our strategy. First and foremost, I am very pleased to announce that we returned to operating profitability in North America after three quarters of losing money. We achieved incremental margins of 65% in North America, and we continue to clearly gain market share as we outgrew our primary competitor in not only North America, but Latin America and the Eastern Hemisphere. We gained significant market share throughout the downturn, coming out of it the highest market share in North America that we’ve ever had. And in Q4, we utilized this increased share to drive margin improvement, and I’ll discuss that in a few minutes. In the Eastern Hemisphere, we maintained our margins quarter-over-quarter, despite continued stress on pricing and revenue activity. We achieved over a $1 billion in cash flow from operations in Q4 alone, underlining our commitment to efficient working capital management. On a low light, as a result of the devaluation of the Egyptian pound, our $0.04 per share adjusted operating results did get hit by significant foreign exchange loss of $53 million or $0.06 per share. Now, these results reflect successful execution in a tough environment and position us for the challenges and opportunities ahead. Now, let me take a few minutes to discuss what we’re seeing in the market today, and our prospects and challenges for the coming year. Despite the positive sentiment surrounding North American land, it is important to remember that our world is still a tale of two cycles. While the North America market appears to have rounded the corner and is on the upswing, the international downswing is still playing out. Let’s talk about North America. On the second quarter call, I told you that customer animal spirits were back in North America. Last quarter, I said that these animal spirits were alive, but somewhat caged up. Now, these animal spirits have broken free and they are running. However, not all customers are running in the same direction or as a pack, but they are running. These animal spirits can be seen by the dramatic increase in customer M&A activity, energy industry initial and secondary company offerings, the significant private equity capital moving into resource plays and of course the increase in the rig count. Customers are excited again, and our conversations have changed from being only about cost control to how we can meet their incremental demand. As things began to recover in Q3 and Q4, we made a conscious strategic choice to not chase additional market share and erode our profits further. Therefore, our North American revenue did not grow at the same pace as the rig count for the last several quarters. The historically high level of market share we built in the downturn gives us what we call the power of choice in the recovery. This is the ability to work with the most efficient customers who value what we do and who reward us for helping them make better wells. With this power of choice, we continued to execute our strategy of high grading the profitability of our portfolio with customers that value our services. Let me tell you how that strategy worked. In Q1 and Q2 in a competitive pricing environment, we built the highest market share we ever had in North America, by demonstrating to our customers the benefits of our efficiency and technology and the ability to make better wells. We saw that historical high market share as an advantage and we wanted to utilize it. In Q3, we told you that we were willing to strategically trade some of that historically high market share for better profitability. Clearly, the time had come to improve returns and that is what we told our customers. In Q4, as demand for our equipment increased and availability tightened, our customer discussions revolved around the unsustainable pricing that was in place and the need for us to make a return before we were willing to continue to work for them or add new equipment. If a customer agreed to better pricing, we continued to work for them, if not, we took that equipment and use it to fill the incremental demand with a customer that shared our view on how to work together and make better wells. These conversations about the need for a healthy, profitable and viable service industry were sometimes hard, but they needed to happen. So in effect, we kept active equipment working at a higher price, while we believe our competition brought equipment into the market to fill that demand at a lower price point. They gained share that we no longer wanted while tying up their equipment at a lower price point in an accelerated market. By executing the strategy, we intentionally gave up some market share in the short run, but we met our goal of returning to operating profitability in North America. We did this because it’s important to keep in mind that above all, we are a returns focused Company. As we go into Q1, we continue to benefit from increased demand from customers and are now at the point where we are bringing back cold stacked equipment. This newly activated equipment is only being added at a rate that ensures it is profitable. It should also stabilize our market share at above historical levels. This action is a meaningful step in the right direction to maintaining the leading market share while at the same time achieving industry leading returns. Bringing back equipment is not without a cost, and Jeff will talk about this in today’s pricing dynamics in a minute. So, as I look at 2017 in North America, I really like how it’s shaping up. I expect as we finalize the execution of our strategy that revenue will meet or exceed rig count growth in 2017. However, we will have to contend with the cost of reactivating frac spreads and inflation on our inputs. Keep in mind that our suppliers also expect to benefit from our customers’ animal spirits. So, let’s turn to the international markets. There pricing and activity levels remain under pressure as we near the bottom of the cycle. Low commodity prices have stressed budgets and impacted economics across the deepwater and mature field markets, which has led to decreased activity and pricing throughout 2016. These headwinds still persist today. Now, there has been a lot of debate as to what commodity price will reactivate the higher cost basins, such as the deepwater complex. It is clearly higher than the price that we are seeing today. Also impacting the price will be OPEC compliance with its new production guidance. Most people agree that the U.S. is now the world’s swing producer and it has demonstrated its ability to ramp up production quickly at a price that may make it difficult for deepwater projects to compete. We believe that the race to get deepwater project cost down versus the impact on commodity prices on increasing U.S. shale production will have to play out over the course of 2017. Therefore, we do not expect to see an inflection in the international markets until the latter part of 2017. In the meantime, our international customers remain focused on cash flow, and traditional contracting cycles will likely mute any dramatic rebound coming off the bottom. We expect revenue and margins to slowly grind down during 2017, as the market seeks to stabilize. Overall, our 2016 results show that we have executed in a challenging market. Guided by the lessons learned from past industry cycles, our strategy focused not only on managing cost but also lining our resources to strengthen our market position, and I think we’ve done that. With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff and Mark to cover our operational and financial results. Jeff?
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. 2016 certainly was a whale of a tough year. I want to thank each of our employees for their hard work and commitment to execute at every turn and deliver Halliburton’s value proposition. We collaborate in engineered solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. There has been a lot of change in North America over the last few months. Dave shared with you how we used our market share strategy to regain profitability. The next step in boosting profitability is increasing prices. So, let me start by talking about where we see pricing. While rumors are circulating in the industry about huge price increases, that’s just not a universal fact. Given our position in North America, no one knows more about pricing than we do, and here is what I do know. First, I like talking about price increases more than decreases, it’s a nice change. Second, the service price recovery is starting from an extremely low base, in many cases below variable cash costs. Third, the level of pricing that satisfies a particular service company depends on where they are on the profitability continuum. Finally, even though the industry is starting in different profitability levels, every company will have to march back up the same path to profitability. Turning to downturn, our industry went through a steep regression in profitability as pricing and activity declined. The industry moved from positive operating margins to negative operating margins and into negative EBITDA and ultimately round up struggling to cover variable cash costs. It was a fast and hard road that caused a dramatic shift in landscape of the service industry and wiped out a significant amount of shareholder equity. The pricing brawl continues as the industry recovers and equipment availability tightens. Pricing at the margin is ultimately set by whoever is satisfied with the lowest returns. It’s important to understand that our competitors’ motivation from margin returns is largely built around where their pricing is anchored today. For example, if they are at negative variable cost, then they’re trying to get to a negative EBITDA. If they’re at negative EBITDA, then they’re trying to get to negative margin and so on. I can tell you, despite what you hear in the market, it’s clearly a bridge too far to skip from negative variable cash to positive operating margin in one step. So, the industry pricing regression I discussed earlier needs to become a pricing progression. This means that for now Halliburton will have to compete with companies that are satisfied with lower levels of short-term profitability. But, we don’t believe their pricing is sustainable. You can’t have negative margins forever. In the meantime, Halliburton will continue to maintain our focus on execution and service quality as we defend our position without sacrificing price. I believe the superior service quality is a prerequisite to having a meaningful pricing discussion, and our dedication to service quality helps create the profitability results for the quarter. As Dave said, we’re at the point in the cycle where we feel it’s appropriate to bring equipment back into the market. We have a disciplined approach which looks at the required combination of market demand, market share and profitable pricing. Our stacked equipment was the best in the industry when it went on the fence and is the best in the industry as we bring it back. Our manufacturing and maintenance capabilities provide us many levers to pull from reactivating cold stacked equipment to building new. This competitive advantage allows us to minimize the costs and time to deliver the necessary equipment to our customers. Our decision to bring equipment back is based on returns. However, there is an associated expense to activate cold stacked equipment. Industry estimates for reactivating spreads very-widely. And while our efficiency and expertise allows to be on the lower end of the scale, it doesn’t make it free. Because we immediately spend some of the costs to reactivate the equipment, it will be a drag on our margins for a few quarters. To give you a rule of thumb, we believe on average, it will cost a penny per share in the quarter we bringing back a given spread. After we absorb the impact of this additional expense, our margins should accelerate towards the end of the year. Now, turning to the international markets. Latin America had a solid quarter. While the region continues to experience activity and pricing headwinds, we were able to finalize a number of items that have pending throughout the year for which we had deferred profit. We saw uptick in software sales [ph] in Venezuela and Mexico and improved activity in Colombia and Argentina. At the same time, headwinds persist in the larger Latin American markets and until these are alleviated, we do not believe we will see improvement. However, we are committed to the region and believe that oil and gas is a critical element to the region’s broader economic recovery. The Eastern Hemisphere was similarly strong in the fourth quarter, but pricing pressure and offshore exposure mean that we continue to expect some decline for these reasons in the near term. We expect to see an inflection in the rig count in the latter half of 2017, supported by strengthening activity in the land-based mature fields markets. I’m more excited than I have ever been about how our approach to collaboration and maximizing asset value resonates with our customers and employees. We continue to focus on increasing barrels and decreasing cost for our clients. This focus is being rewarded in tender wins across the globe. I could go on and on with examples, but I just want to highlight a few right now. In Oman, we’ve recently started work on $0.5 billion production enhancement contract, which will bring our superior technology and expertise to an exciting tight gas market. In India, we were rewarded a five-rig multiyear contract across several product service lines. This win is a direct result of the team’s integrated approach and efficient solutions, designed to execute the work. It’s a great example of how we can collaborate both internally and whether customers to solve challenges and create results. Landmark had a great quarter and year, our digital solutions including OpenEarth and iEnergy are gain wide acceptance, both our platforms for collaboration that cultivate data sharing, application building, and knowledge discovery. Using our Exploration Insights platform, we started a strategic Basin Mastery project for a customer that will allow comparison of assets across their global portfolio. This will save the customer hundreds of hours of time and millions in financial investments. Reservoir Insight is a great example of how we can maximize our customers’ asset value. These examples show our value proposition at work and highlight the successes we’ve had this year. In many ways, 2016 was like a barroom brawl where everyone and I mean everyone took a punch. It is 2017 now and a brawl will continue but I like our chances in that fight. Why, because we are focused on adding capacity where it’s required, keeping a lid on fixed costs and doing the best job serving our customers. I really look forward to seeing the year unfold. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Mark for a financial update. Mark?
Mark McCollum: Thanks, Jeff. Let’s start with the summary of our adjusted fourth quarter results compared sequentially to the third quarter. Total Company revenue for the quarter was $4 billion and operating income was $276 million, representing a sequential increase of 5% and 115% respectively. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in North America, the continued impact of our global cost savings initiatives and end of the year software and product sales. Moving to our regional results, North America revenue increased 9% with operating margins improving by approximately 550 basis points. The higher U.S. land rig count drove increased equipment utilization, particularly in our drilling and evaluation product lines. We also saw the impact of our strategy to improve pricing and profitability in our pressure pumping business that Dave described earlier. Latin America revenue increased by 3% and operating income nearly tripled, primarily driven by increased activity levels in Colombia and Argentina, and year-end software sales and consulting in Venezuela and Mexico. Turning to Europe, Africa CIS, we saw fourth quarter revenue decline by 9% with the decrease in operating income of 5%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by weather related activity declines in the North Sea and Russia partially offset by improved activity in Egypt and Nigeria. In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue increased by 10% with an increase in operating income of 32%. These results were primarily driven by increased software sales and project management services across the region. Our corporate expense totaled $67 million for the quarter and we anticipate that our corporate expenses will remain in that range for the first quarter of 2017. Net interest expense for the quarter was $137 million, better than our guidance as a function of both higher cash balances and higher money market rates. We expect that this level of net interest expense will remain through the first quarter of 2017. We reported $91 million of other expense for the quarter; this line item was impacted by foreign exchange losses in various countries, primarily due to the strengthening in U.S. dollar. The single largest factor included in our adjusted results was a $53 million or $0.06 per share non-tax deductable impact from the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. Our ability to hedge our exposure to the Egyptian pound in front of this devaluation was limited due to the illiquid nature of the derivative market and the inordinate economic cost associated with entering into any available derivative contracts. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 34%; the quarterly rate is always a function of the tax rate you expect for the full year and 2016’s rate estimates have been particularly volatile because earnings were so slow. This quarter’s rate was also affected by foreign tax assessment and a new deemed profit jurisdiction, the non-deductible exchange loss in Egypt and our earnings mix as the U.S. begins to recover. For the full year 2016, however, our effective tax rate was 24%. And as we go forward in 2017, we’re expecting the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. During the fourth quarter, we also incurred impairments and other pretax charges of $169 million, approximately one-third of which was severance-related cost, primarily to headcount reductions in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America as we continue to right size our business to the current market. We also recorded $54 million for the net impact of the previously announced settlement of a long-standing class action lawsuit. This amount was recorded in corporate and other in our GAAP results. Turning to cash flow, we generated $720 million of cash, improving our cash position at year-end of $4 billion. This increase in cash was primarily due to working capital improvements and continued disciplined capital spending. We improved our days sales outstanding in the quarter by 10 days, while our days of inventory dropped by six days. We continue to believe that we’ve moved into a period of shorter duration cycles. And given the amount of excess capital available in the market, we’re hesitant to build any additional tools or equipment unless that is new technology, built for a specific contract we’ve won or the expansion of market share. Consistent with that strategy, we further reduced our capital expenditures as we exited the year, ending 2016 with the total CapEx spend of approximately $800 million. Our current guidance for 2017 capital expenditures is $1 billion. This CapEx guidance includes reactivating cold stacked pressure pumping equipment and continued conversion of our hydraulic fracturing fleet to Q10 pumps to support our surface efficiency strategy. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.4 billion for 2017. Of our $4 billion in cash, approximately half is offshore. We require about $1 billion to run the business. Given the strength of our cash position and the potential impact of U.S. tax reform, we’re actively evaluating our options and opportunities around uses of cash, which could include accelerating the maturity of debt, funding acquisitions and organic growth projects or shareholder return opportunities. Now, turning to our near-term operational outlook, let me provide you some comments for the first quarter of 2017. Our international results will be subject to typical weather-related seasonality in the North Sea and Russia, and the roll-off of higher margin year-end software and product sales, which tends to hit Latin America more acutely. This will be exacerbated by the cyclical headwinds that Dave described earlier. Although difficult to predict, at this point, we anticipate first quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenues to decline sequentially by a little under 10% with margins down several hundred basis points. And in Latin America, we anticipate revenues to increase sequentially by mid to low single-digit percentages with margins retreating to the low single-digits. As we move into 2017 in North America, we anticipate subject to weather disruptions that our revenue growth will return to perform in line with U.S. rig count, which is already up 14% against the fourth quarter average. Furthermore, we believe our margins will reflect incrementals of 40% to 45% as they absorb the impact of adding additional pressure pumping equipment to the market. There is one last comment I’d like to make in terms of financial reporting going forward. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we’ll start reporting our four geographic regions showing revenue only and we’ll only report operating income by area, which is consistent with our major peer. Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?
Dave Lesar: So, let’s sum things up. To what it’s worth, we believe we were one of the winners in the 2016 downturn. Our 2016 results reflect our successful execution in a historically tough environment and provides us with the position of strength for the markets ahead. The North America market share we built in the downturn provided us the power of choice and therefore the ability to drive returns. We strategically gave up market share in the short-run for the sake of regaining profitability, but we fully expect to get it back. We are bringing back cold stacked equipment to satisfy customer demand. This equipment will meet our return hurdles and stabilize our market share above historical levels. Each spread, however, will cost us $0.01 per share in the quarter that we bring it back. The headwinds we faced in the international markets in 2016 still persist, and we do not expect to see a turn until latter part of the year. As a result, we will continue to control our costs. And just like we were the winners in the downturn, I fully expect that we will win the recovery. Before we open it up for questions, I want to let you know that due to longstanding travel and business commitments, I will not be participating in our first quarter conference call. Jeff will be providing market comments on my behalf. With that, let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin. Angie, your line is open, please check the mute button. Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin.
David Anderson: [Technical Difficulty] in terms of your utilization of your logistical network, you’ve mentioned bringing cost structure more variable, at the same time, I just wondered if you consider expanding any part of the chain at this stage?
Dave Lesar: Hey, David, you came on -- we missed the first part of your question.
David Anderson: Okay. Sorry about that Dave. Yes, I was just asking about with increasing profit intensity in the market share gains you’ve talked about, just curious about where you’re in the utilization of your supply chain and kind of your logistical network as you build that out. Can you kind of help us understand kind of where you think you are and whether or not you think you need to expand that?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, Dave. This is Jeff. Look, the logistical infrastructure that we have continues to prove itself extremely valuable. And as the market tightens, it gets utilized even more. We’ve got sand positions -- trans-load type positions in every market; we’ve invested in the logistics, which in my view is the most important part of that supply chain and that’s the part that gets the tightest the quickest. And so, we like where we are. We even completed some activities through the downturn in key markets. So, we actually never backed away from that, and it will be valuable.
David Anderson: Thanks, Jeff. And Dave, maybe a bigger picture question here. I was just kind of curious your take on kind of what the E&Ps are saying now, somewhat publicly. It really continued to downplay or even dismiss the impact of service cost inflation, continue to be adamant the majority of these cost savings have been structural. I was just kind of curious what your take is on this. And if you were in their seat, would you be factoring 5% to 10% increase in cost in the budget or would you be using something higher at this stage?
Dave Lesar: I would be using something higher, number one. Number two, clearly, some of the cost reductions are structural, but I think as the equipment tightens, commodity prices increase that everybody wants availability of equipment when they want it, where they want it and how they want it. I don’t see that there is going to be the ability to -- for the customer to hold prices down. I mean it’s going to be a supply and demand market, it always is; we will work with those customers that want to work with us. And really, the model for us hasn’t changed. Efficiency is way more important than pricing. And those customers that want to work with us to keep our equipment efficient are those that we’re going to work with. And I think that we’ll both be winners in that scenario.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin. Angie, your line is open. Please check your mute button.
Angie Sedita: So, this question is really for Dave or Jeff. I thought it was very noteworthy here that you’re reactivating fleets today. And I’d appreciate more color on this decision as you actively way out pricing versus sharing your thought?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks, Angie. Look, I mean, the decision to add equipment is really around we see the market tightening. And in our view, the market share strategy works through the downturn, and as we bring equipment back, clearly it’s an economic decision; each time we put the equipment back to work, we expect to remain returns. But we also want to maintain that power of choice which is very important to us as the market recovers. And so, as Dave just said, we really like our customer mix today, and we want to make certain that we can serve those customers. And we see that’s a key component of how we win the recovery.
Angie Sedita: And then, maybe you could talk about the potential or do you see or is there potential for any bottlenecks in the second half of 2017 at the logistics, sand or people, and is there possibility that could lead to an increase in the pace of pricing across the industry?
Jeff Miller: Well, it’s always the same sort of three things. It’s equipment, sand and people that tend to crop up. I’ll take those one at a time though. From an equipment perspective, it’s as much speed the market as it is anything else. And we’re so happy with our manufacturing footprint in Duncan. So, differentially we have that advantage. Sand, again, it’s not the sand volume I believe will be adequate but it’s the logistics. And again, from our perspective, we’re well-positioned there. We’ve maintained that infrastructure and then finally, people. And we were fortunate to keep our experienced people to the degree that we could through the downturn that will pay back as we go into recover mode. And it is easy to forget, but in 2014, we actually hired 21,000 people onto our payroll. So, we have the ability to flex, and so all of those things are being managed today.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from James West with Evercore ISI. You may begin. 
James West: Jeff, when you talk about the price -- the frac pricing in North America and your ability to raise pricing or to raise pricing with the customers you want to be working with, I guess a couple of things. One is, is all the price increases that you’ve asked were so far sticking? And then two, if you are -- as you on stacked equipment, are you meeting your full return threshold or is this more of a let’s get in front of the market with some market share to get that return later?
Jeff Miller: Well, James, the pricing is still the fight. I mean it’s not -- what we’ve seen so far is I’d say to start the utilization and efficiency largely got us to where we are, though clearly we have seen some pricing and that’s progress, but we are absolutely not where we want to be. And so, as we look at equipment, we expect better returns. I think it’s important to note that at least in the last 90 days, we are at a place where more work is in fact helpful.
James West: And then, maybe for Mark, just to clarify, I am coming up with on our math about $0.11 of negative currency adjustments for the quarter, so the quarter would be more like $0.15; obviously $0.06 of that from Egypt. And are we correct on that that it all drops to the bottom line, so it would be more like a $0.15 quarter, or I guess you could call it $0.10, if you wanted to say Egypt is the outlier?
Mark McCollum: You’re right to assume generally speaking currency losses, because they are essentially -- we are a dollar denominated Company, aren’t tax affected. It’s not at realizable loss in the countries that they recorded. So, that’s true that they’re not tax affected. However, I don’t know that I would jump to that conclusion. Clearly, the Egyptian pound devaluation was something that was something that was sort of out of the norm. The pounds had been pegged to the dollar, and all of a sudden they decided not to be, it was an immediate 50% reduction in the currency. The other parts of the currency losses though, I would say, we experienced those quarter in and quarter out. And I would say that for the most part, the rest of them are not unusual, depending our function of the strengthening dollar. But if you look back for the last several quarters, we’ve had them as they’re in the numbers and they were a part of how we had guided the Street as well. So, I don’t know that I would necessarily exclude those as being necessarily unusual. And we’ll expect that they will continue as long as the dollar continues to be as strong as it is and continue to strengthen.
James West: Okay. So, about $0.10. Got it. Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. You may begin.
Jud Bailey: I wanted to follow up on some of the commentary regarding the reactivation of pressure pumping spreads if I could. Jeff or Dave, is there any way to give any color on maybe the magnitude of the reactivations that you are discussing with customers and for the ones you are contemplating, do you incur the costs, primarily in the first quarter or are you in talks about also reactivating equipment in the second quarter and so, does that drag from a cost standpoint continue in the second quarter as well?
Dave Lesar: Jud, we’re not going to answer that; it’s just competitive and it’s a key part of our strategy in terms of how we go to market. I think the color we would give is that what we want to do is be in a position to work with those customers that value our services. And we expect to see the flight to quality that’s pretty consistent in this part of the market. And for that reason, we put the time and the effort in to make it certain that our equipment is best in the business.
Jeff Miller: Okay, understood. I guess another question, even though you are seeing the headwinds from reactivation costs in 1Q, the first quarter guidance is for incrementals of 40% to 45%. Just to make sure I am thinking about it the right way, as you get some of the reactivation headwinds behind you and of course see higher pricing, is it reasonable to anticipate later in the year for some quarters, we should see higher incrementals than that 45%, as you get pricing and the alleviation of the reactivation related headwinds out of the way?
Mark McCollum: Jud, one of the things you need -- we talked about the cost being in Q1, but there will be cost in Q2 as well, because the ability to get all the fleets activated is going to take a little bit of time. We’re not going to be activating all of the cold stacked equipment that we have, but there is some decisions around how much we’re going to make available in the market at this point in time and we’ll make later decisions. And again, we talk about being very flexible in this kind of market, watching how the market behaves, but as Jeff said, we are going to get equipment ready to go; it’s going to cost us something and we’ll probably be doing that through the course of the end of Q2 and then sort of decide where the market is and where we are to address how much further we go.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. You may begin.
Bill Herbert: Jeff, back to the pricing narrative here, I am a little bit confused. On the one hand, you state explicitly in the narrative that the sequential improvement is driven by pricing and activity; secondly, your refusal to reactivate equipment without adequate rates of return and yet we’re processing non-trivial reactivations over the first half of this year. So, by implication, pricing is improving, notwithstanding the fact that it might not be of the same magnitude that you’d want it to.
Jeff Miller: Correct. Bill, yes, seeing improvement; our visibility is improvement further into the future as opposed to the other way. And as a result, that’s the case for reactivating equipment. We see places for that equipment to go and make it return, albeit not the returns we would like but certainly a return and getting us on the path to making those kinds of returns.
Bill Herbert: And, notwithstanding the fact that we had a margin strategy in the fourth quarter versus a market share strategy and thus the delta between revenues and rig count, I would suspect that over the course of 2017 and beyond, the fundamental completions intensity versus drilling intensity would probably put an upward bias on your revenue versus rig count. And so at some point, over the course of 2017, the rate of revenue expansion should outstrip the rate of rig count expansion, correct?
Jeff Miller: Yes. That’s a fair analysis. I agree with that.
Bill Herbert: And then last one from me, Mark. I know it’s hard to expound on this at this stage, because of the fluid nature of the subject. But, can you talk a little bit about Halliburton’s tax rate optionality in the event of the fact that the U.S. corporate tax rate is bent lower?
Mark McCollum: I don’t know that I can say much. I mean, I think that one of the things that we think about is in relationship to where cash is, and we our U.S. domiciled Company, it would have a dramatic impact on us, you see particularly during this period of time, when North America is beginning to expand, a drop in the U.S. tax rate would make a difference. From a manufacturing perspective, most of our equipment is manufactured in the U.S., we actually have worked a strategy to move manufacturing around where it was geographically located to serve the markets where it was situated; and so all of that would be helpful. This past year in 2016, if you recall, we have already taken the tax hit to basically, if a situation presented itself that we could bring our cash back to the U.S. in a tax advantage way, we could do that without a significant impact on our results. We watch that very carefully. But we have -- I guess, what I’m telling you is we have tremendous optionality. I think what we’re just going to pay attention to is how is that going to move forward. We’re going to be working with Congress and the Hill. Our tax Senior VP will be going to the Hill in a couple of weeks, and we’ll just -- we’ll continue to try stay tied8 into where things will be moving and to move as quickly as we can to take advantage of whatever present itself.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
Ole Slorer: I was quite impressed with the international margins, and you highlighted of course year-end software and product sales, like we always see. But, could you be a little bit more specific on the margin development into the first quarter as well as the revenue numbers that you guided?
Mark McCollum: Well, maybe, when you say more specific, I mean, I think we tried to give guidance by area, right? I think North America revenue should be in line with the rig count; our incrementals should be in that 40% to 45% range. When you look outside of North America, our Eastern Hemisphere which probably benefited more from some of the product -- year-end product sales but also gets hit more by weather-related seasonality; in the Q1, we expect that the revenues will be down a little under 10%, high single-digits. The margins, the impact -- the margins did look great; they’re very strong because of the product sales; they should drop off a couple of hundred basis points in the first quarter. And then, Latin America, even though we had strong software sales of consulting which impacted, and those come at very, very high incremental, we actually think revenues will be up a little bit, but that it will have a marginal impact and they’ll still fall back down to low single-digits.
Ole Slorer: Sorry. And margins in Latin America?
Mark McCollum: Margins will fall back into the low single digits.
Ole Slorer: Low single digits, okay. Yes, I thought that’s the revenue. Okay. And second question would just be on the North American reactivation of pressure pumping. At what point do you believe that you have to add new capacity rather than cold-stacked and relatively intact capacity?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Look, that’s decisions we’ll make as we work through the process and certainly not something we’re going to share today, just from a competitive perspective. But, we do believe that we like where we are now and we like the plan we have in place.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
Jim Wicklund: Good morning, guys. And when you all complain about getting too much pricing or note that you’ve gotten enough pricing, that’s the day the world ends. The comments about reactivation costing a penny, was that a penny per spread that you reactivate? Because if I do just math on a 35% tax rate, that’s $10 million to $12 million reactivation cost per spread. Am I doing the math correctly, guys?
Mark McCollum: You’re doing the math correctly.
Jeff Miller: Yes. Maybe, it’s worth a little color on what that is. And so, as we think about penny per spread, we see estimates are all over the place. I actually believe we’re at the lower end of the range in a sense that it is equipment repair but it’s also advanced hiring, it’s logistics that go with each spreads. So, that’s sort of a fully loaded look at reactivation. And we expect to have the best equipment in the marketplace. So, we certainly put the time into that.
Jim Wicklund: Okay. That clarification is helpful. And if I could on the international side, you guys note that the international inflection is probably going to be later in 2017. And, Jeff, I think you said it was onshore that you expected to move up first in mature fields. Where do you guys see sub-Saharan Africa and offshore Brazil, when do we start to see an improvement in deepwater?
Jeff Miller: Well, I think that’s the toughest hand in terms of efficiency. And I would say at this point in time, the commodity price just had to stabilize at a high enough number that makes it as attractive. And I’m just looking at recent headlines but a lot of investment moving to North America; unconventionals that -- where that money had choices. So, I also think that from an inflection timing perspective, the lead time between investment decision drilling activity is long in those markets for a lot of reasons; and every day that we see delay that gets pushed out yet even further. So, we like our position in both of those places and we’ll be ready when it does recover, but I really don’t -- we think it’s further out than -- further out.
Dave Lesar: Yes. Jim, let me give you an anecdote. I was talking to the CEO of one of our IOC customers Friday, obviously not going to say who it was. And he said that there was not a single asset in their portfolio outside the U.S. that competes with their U.S. opportunities right now. And to me that’s a pretty amazing statement to me in terms of really how much further commodity prices have to go up to bring some of these more either highly complicated or longer duration projects to the front of the queue get an FID decision made around them.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your may begin.
Scott Gruber: Just a quick question on the reactivation cost, a penny per quarter per spread. Is that quarterly impact including both, OpEx and CapEx framed relative to your earnings power or is that actually what hits the P&L during the quarter?
Mark McCollum: Yes. So, it’s not a penny per quarter per spread, it’s just a penny per spread, and it is just the operating expense impact to cost. As Jeff indicated, it’s more of just the maintenance on the quarter itself; it’s also the recruiting cost and the other activation cost that we are incurring to get that spread ready to go. It does not include the capital cost. And so, as I articulated, our capital forecast for 2017 is right now as I said about $1 billion. And that incremental that we’re looking at between 2016 and 2017 is a fairly good estimate of some of the activation costs that will be incurred on the capital side to get some of that equipment ready to go, including retrofitting some of our old equipment with Q10s as we get them ready to get back in the market.
Dave Lesar: I think here is a simple way to think about it. We bring a spread back this quarter, the negative impact on our earnings is $0.01; in the second quarter that spread starts to earn revenue and will give us the incremental margins and incremental revenue for that spread. So the penny is a one quarter impact. But clearly, we will be likely to be bringing some spreads back in Q2. So, the impact of those spreads in Q2 will be a penny per share, which is why I made the comment earlier that it’s really going to be toward the end of the year. Once we’ve absorbed the frontend cost of these spreads coming on where we really expect to see our stimulation and pumping margins pop-up.
Scott Gruber: And then a question on sand delivery. Jeff, have you seen any degradation to the percentage of jobs that you are supplying sand for in the marketplace?
Jeff Miller: No, not necessarily. We continue to deliver sand and most of the jobs where we work that’s -- assurity of supply such an important piece of our own efficiency model that we make certain that we control those variables when we go to work and we found it to be very effective.
Scott Gruber: And so, today, when you talk about putting fleets back to work at a profit, one, is that an operating profit; and two, does it include the logistics cost and investment?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean that’s -- when we think about making an economic decision about putting a spread to work and making returns, it’s a fully loaded operating income returns for the Company.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. You may begin.
Sean Meakim: I was hoping to elaborate on the logistical challenges we discussed earlier, specifically from the E&P perspective. Are there any pinch points to focus on beyond labor and proppant that could create some challenges, as we move up the cycle here; just I am thinking about things like water and electricity? Some of these emerging plays like the Delaware, it seems like that could be an issue for E&Ps and just curious how you are partnering with your customers try to work through those issues.
Jeff Miller: Look, I mean, essential to our value proposition is how we collaborate engineered solutions to maximize asset value and a key component of that is collaboration around all of those things that help our customers be successful. I don’t see those necessarily as issues that can’t be overcome by any means, water and electricity or things that our customers are very good at managing. And so, I think we’ll find solutions to those.
Sean Meakim: And then, just a follow-up on the reactivations, could you give us a sense of the mix today for Q10s and maybe how that could progress through this year, given the CapEx budget that you laid out?
Jeff Miller: So, about 60% of our overall fleet that’s out there today that’s Q10s. So, as we reactivate crews coming in, we are going to be placing an emphasis on Q10 fleets including that we talked about retrofitting some old equipment, they need pump replacement, we are going to retrofit with Q10 pumps on that equipment. And so, our hope is that as this new equipment comes out, it will continue to increase the total percentage of Q10 fleets in the market.
Dave Lesar: Yes. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of the Q10 technology. I think it’s delivering the efficiency and the differential, capital efficiency that we’d expected when we brought those out. So, we are certainly incentivized to make those the growing part of our fleet. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital. You may begin.
Kurt Hallead: A question for Dave; you bring up some very interesting points in your earlier commentary; and given your history now in the business and through the cycles, I was wondering if you can share your perspectives on the number of different companies in the frac space that are going to be coming public. On one hand, you can probably make an argument that it’s positive because at the end of the day when you go public, you’ve got to be as profitable as you can be, but on the other hand as you go public, I’m sure shareholders are going to expect some sort of growth, which means more capital being deployed into the business and this excess capacity factor may be dampening the prospect for profit improvement. So, I am curious as to your perspective on that, Dave. How are you guys thinking about it and what’d be a good way for people like us outside the industry to think about that?
Dave Lesar: I think I guess the way I think about it is in a couple of ways. One is, you’ve got some sort of brand names and I won’t say who, who are actually exiting the pressure pumping business. So, they have looked at the space and have decided that they don’t want to be in it for now or don’t want to be in it at all, while at the same time, you clearly have a wave of companies that are really just pumping companies only coming into the public market. And you absolutely put your finger on it. I think by being public, there is an expectation that you have profit and that you get paid for growth. And so, what they hear from their shareholders, and I suspect to some extent, most of their shareholders are on this call listening, and it really is going to be the message that they get from those shareholders as to what’s more important, growth or profitability. In our case, because of our position, we think we can have it both; we’re not a afraid of competition; we’ve had a lot of competition come into the market over the past many years. We like our position there; we like our customers that we have. So, at the end of the day, we’ll compete with whatever is out there with whatever message their shareholders are getting. But at the end of the day, it’s about providing a good service to a customer at the right price. And I absolutely love where we’re positioned, if that’s going to be the state of play, and it is.
Kurt Hallead: And follow-up, maybe for you Dave too; your comment before was pretty intriguing about your conversation with an IOC executive and how they are thinking about their portfolio. Would you say that that is -- could you kind of extrapolate that and say that the vast majority of the IOCs that you talk to have that same mindset? And I would just try to put it into a context that the largest IOC in the world placed a $6.5 billion bet on the Permian, last week. So, I think that does speak a lot for their view of where their opportunity set is. So, any incremental perspectives on that?
Dave Lesar: No, I think each company is different; their portfolio is different; when they acquire those assets are different; how long their production sharing contracts in many cases have to go. So, I wouldn’t generalize the comment to the broader industry. I just thought it was in an interesting anecdotal point from a particular customer. But, you’re absolutely right, even the largest of the IOCs clearly have a focus on the unconventional in the U.S. And I think that bodes well, not only for our position in North America, but the future of the industry here.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thank you, Shannon. So, before we finish, I’d like to emphasize two points. First, our strategy to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value, meaning deliver the lowest costs per BOE is built on Halliburton’s competitive advantage and is well aligned with our customers and is winning contracts and follow-on work. Second, our focus on fairway customers who best utilize our approach to delivering the lowest cost per BOE and our ability to flex quickly with the market, place Halliburton in a fantastic position to win the recovery. We’ll look forward to talking with you next quarter. Shannon, you may now close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentleman, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Lance Loeffler, Halliburton’s Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2016 conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton’s website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other securities and exchange commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today also may include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release, which can be found on our website. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Lance and good morning to everyone. Let me start by saying that I am very pleased with our results. I never thought I would be so satisfied by barely making a profit. But given where this market is, I certainly am. Through hard work and determination, we have returned to positive territory for our earnings. Now, this has been a historic down cycle for the industry and it’s had its fair share of challenges. Our organization is meeting those challenges head-on and fighting through them. I am very proud of our leadership and all of our employees. We are the execution Company and I believe this quarter we out-executed even the very high expectations we placed on our organization. Let’s take a minute and talk about what transpired over the quarter. Our North America revenue grew 9% for the period, representing the first revenue increase in seven quarters. Our results improved as we took advantage of the rig count growth by focusing on increasing utilization and working our surface efficiency model. Our customers’ animal spirits remain alive and well in North America even though for some they may feel caged in a bit by cash flow constraints in the short-term. The average U.S. rig count increased 14% over the quarter, driven primarily by rig additions to smaller operators where we saw a trend of less service intensive wells, which is not activity typically worth chasing at today’s pricing. This quarter was also impacted by the natural lag time between drilling and completion activity. However, we are now seeing completion activities starting to pick-up as we start the fourth quarter. We continue to aggressively implement our structural cost reductions announced in our first quarter call, and we have met our goal. On a monthly basis, we have already achieved the run rate of a $1 billion of cost savings annually. We also generated over a $1 billion in cash flow from operating activities this quarter. As you all know, as we executed our playbook, we gained significant market share globally through the downturn. As the markets stabilize, our primary focus will now switch to improving our margins while maintaining that market share. In the U.S., we believe we now have the highest market share we’ve ever had. And at this point, if we have to give some of it back to move margins up, we might take that approach. In North America, we achieved a 41% incremental margin. This is a strong step in the right direction as we work to regain profitability there. We remain steadfast in our belief that significant activity increases from our customers starts with sustainable commodity prices over $50 per barrel, which we haven’t seen in any meaningful way yet since the rig count activity bottomed out.  Operators have had time to reflect on our future drilling plans, and I believe they will approach the recovery with a rational, methodical response in activity based on commodity price fluctuations. Now, looking ahead to the fourth quarter on North America land, activity levels are difficult to call at this point. Based on current customer feedback, we remain cautious around customer activity due to holiday and seasonal weather related downturns. Our customers may take extended breaks, starting as early as Thanksgiving and push additional work to the first quarter of 2017. As one customer told me, Dave, it doesn’t make any sense for me to rent an efficient high-spec rig, if I have to start and stop all the time for the holidays or the last five weeks of the year. I just can’t get the efficiencies I’m paying for in the rig. I would rather just wait till next year to start drilling. And I believe we will see a lot of that mentality in the fourth quarter. But that being said, it does not change our view that things are getting better for us and our customers. Now, let’s turn internationally. I like where our market share is today in the international markets, and I believe we continue to outperform our peers. I expect the international markets to slowly grind downward due to the lower commodity price environment. We experienced activity and pricing headwinds during the quarter, but in anticipation of those forces, we aggressively managed our cost. Although we have had to concede some on pricing, we have worked closely with our customers during the past year to improve their project economics to technology and operating efficiency. We expect to see a bottoming of the international rig count in the first half of 2017. Land-based mature field activity should lead the international recovery, while we expect the deepwater complex to remain so severely challenged for the foreseeable future. Even though the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter, there is no question we remain in a very challenging market. However, we’re confident in our ability to navigate through this cycle and in our continued focus on unconventional mature fields in deepwater markets. As we have said before, unconventional, particularly those in North America are leading their recovery in activity, providing the optimal combination of short cycle returns and fastest incremental barrel to market. Mature fields continue to be resilient given their relatively low lifting cost. And finally, deepwater remains structurally challenged with higher costs and long duration project characteristics. While each faces a different set of circumstances today, you can be sure we’re looking at our business closely to ensure that we accelerate our growth in each sector as the industry begins to heal. As we have said for some time, North America has assumed there role of swing producer in global oil production. Because of this shift away from production discipline, which was historically created by OPEC, our industry will likely experience shorter commodity price cycles going forward. So, we see the future market as a combination of shorter cycles and range-bound commodity prices. In that environment, it is imperative that we returns-focused companies like Halliburton be more asset-light. Having an organization, structuring in a way that is flexible, nimble and efficient and that can adapt to these new quick-moving cycles will be critical to drive the returns results our shareholders have come to expect. Our philosophy is then in prioritizing returns over margins and revenue, and that philosophy will continue. Now don’t get me wrong. We are always focused on improving margins. But keep in mind, the last cycle of $100 oil covered up terrible inefficiencies across the industry. In today’s environment, asset utilization will be just as critical to improving margins. And I have full confidence we’re taking the necessary steps to achieve that. Positioning us for success while navigating through this deep cyclical downturn was one of the most intellectually stimulating management challenges we have ever had. And I am confident that Halliburton management team has and will continue to successfully meet each and every challenge. With that let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark?
Mark McCollum: Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Let’s start with the summary of our third quarter results compared to our second quarter results on an adjusted basis. Total Company revenue for the quarter was flat at $3.8 billion, while our operating income doubled to a $128 million. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in North America and the continued impact of our global cost savings initiatives. Moving to our regional results, North America revenue increased 9% with the $58 million increase in operating results or 47% sequentially. The higher U.S. land rig count coupled with better equipment utilization and our ongoing cost management efforts drove this improvement. In Latin America, revenue and operating income declined by 13% and 50% respectively. These results primarily reflect reduced activity levels in Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela as we’ve now experienced a 15-year low in the regional rig count. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue declined 6% as a result of lower drilling activity in West Africa and Continental Europe. Operating income increased 19%, primarily related to our cost savings initiatives and improved pressure pumping and pipeline service profitability throughout the region. In Middle East/Asia, revenue declined 3% with the decline in operating income of 4%. The decrease through the quarter was primarily driven by reduced activity across Asia Pacific, including Australia and Indonesia as well as pricing pressure across the entire region. Our corporate and other expense for the third quarter totaled approximately $47 million, which was positively impacted by a true-up of some of our insurance reserves. For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to return to our previous run rate of approximately $60 million. Interest expense for the quarter was a $141 million and was positively impacted by the interest income we’re now earning on the Venezuelan promissory notes we accepted in exchange for some of our trade receivables last quarter. We expect that this level of net interest expense will be our new run rate for the next several quarters. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was a 114% benefit, well above the already unusual 50% rate we anticipated on our last call. As we’ve discussed before, these unusual effective tax rates are primarily the result of having tax losses in the U.S. that are offset by taxable income in foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates. However, the difference this quarter from the rate we anticipated was largely due to an adjustment reflecting the beneficial use of an Argentinean tax treaty that limits the taxation of royalty payments for intellectual property and will allow for more efficient movement of our foreign cash in the future. Based on our current outlook, we anticipate that our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter will be approximately 65%. Turning to cash flow, we improved our cash position during the third quarter, ending the period with $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents even after paying off $600 million of senior notes. This increase in cash flow was primarily due to working capital improvements which included a seven-plus-day reduction of our day sales outstanding and the receipt of a series of tax refunds. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be approximately $850 million. Now, turning to our short-term operational outlook, let me provide you with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. In North America, the uncertainty surrounding customer activity around the holiday season makes the quarter difficult to predict. Based on what our customers are collectively telling us, we anticipate our revenue to perform in line with the rig count and we expect our sequential incremental margins to be 35% to 40%. In our international business, we believe the typical seasonal uptick in year in software and products sales will be minimal this year as customer budgets are exhausted and may not fully offset continued pricing and activity pressures. As such, we expect fourth quarter revenue and margins to come in flat compared to the third quarter. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone. I’d like to thank and congratulate all of our employees for their fantastic execution throughout the cycle. It’s been a tough two years and our organization has delivered on service quality, has delivered on cost savings and has absolutely executed on our value preposition, collaborating and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. The result of this execution was improved margins and repeat business. So, let’s start with North America. While the supply and demand balance for U.S. onshore services is heading in the right direction, we are still in an oversupplied equipment market. Our customers remain focused on cost and producing more barrels. I believe this puts us in an excellent position. No one is better collaborating with customers to engineer solutions that deliver the lowest cost per BOE than Halliburton. In fact, the more I talk to customers, the more I’m convinced this is the winning formula. In pressure pumping, we estimate that the U.S. active fleet, I emphasize ‘active’ grew to over $7 million horsepower and the utilization of that active marketed fleet is about 70%. This is a long way from full capacity, but it represents substantial tightening during the third quarter. And as I said last quarter, this is the first step towards a balanced market for the industry’s available fleet. And while we know the industry has additional horsepower on the sidelines that could come into the market, we also know that this additional equipment require substantial maintenance to be put back to work, and will require adequate price increases to justify its return. So, as we look ahead, we expect pricing to work its way through a couple of predicable steps. The first step which we’re starting to see now is a tightening of active capacity. This will have a modest price impact but more importantly, it allows increased utilization to have a positive contribution to earnings. Step two is when we see equipment requiring significant investment returning to the market. I expect that this will require a significantly higher pricing to justify the investment. This is by no means traditional pricing power; instead, it’s the industry recognizing the relationship between investments and returns plateau. Market share is valuable and that’s why we build it in the downturn. I think Dave was crystal clear that our target is leading returns, and we have not forgotten that. High market share gives us choice in the recovery to work with the most efficient customers and value what we do and who ultimately reward us for helping them make better wells. There is no doubt that in this environment our clients are planning work based on commodity price. The stakes had never been higher for us to help maximize the value of their assets. And this is exactly what we’re doing. So, let me take you through some examples of how we’re doing this today. Last quarter, we worked with a Permian operator who wanted to step outside of their core assets and find a way to optimize the value of their acreage. With the robust drilling and completion plan in place, the customer started to minimize completion damage during flowback and maximize overall recovery. Through the use of our CALIBR Engineered Flowback service, we were able to prevent damage and achieve a 15% higher cumulative production on this well than on wells nearby with similar completions. The well is now the best producer in the customer’s portfolio despite it being in the geology that had been originally considered marginal. There has been a lot of talk about drilling in core reservoir rock recently. I believe it’s now our job to help our customers extend the definition of core. This is a great example of how we listen to our customers drivers and work with them to develop a unique solution to make their goals. CALIBR not been used before in the Permian but thanks to this success, it’s gained traction in that basin. In the Middle East, we recently engaged in a highly collaborative project where the customer’s drivers were to improve delivery time and production. We developed a solution that stimulated a well in less time and in a more cost effective manner. Using our surgi-squeeze technique where coiled tubing is used to deliver more focused stimulation to selective areas we were able to use fewer chemicals and reduce pumping time by 40%. This highlights how Halliburton systematically collaborates with the customer, the engineered solution that maximizes our asset value. In Brazil, we worked to maximize our customer’s asset value through intelligent completions. These are essential in the pre-salt area to improve reservoir management and production, while reducing the overall well cost. In the quarter, we completed a multiyear campaign of 40 successful intelligent completions, which lowered the lifting cost dramatically. This is what clients like about Halliburton. We collaborate, meaning listen and respond to our customers. We focus on creating and maintaining strong client relationships. It’s why we win and keep work. It’s why we get things done and why we are the execution Company. To sum up, I’ve walked through our value proposition and action, and it’s equally effective in all of our strategic markets unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater. The takeaway is that Halliburton is well-positioned to win the recovery in each of these markets. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?
Dave Lesar: Thanks Jeff, and let me summarize. As we predicted, the North America unconventional market has responded the quickest demonstrated by the increase in recent rig count activity. However, we continue to believe meaningful activity increases from our customers will not start until we see sustainable commodity prices above $50 per barrel. And while the international markets will take a little more time to rebound, we are maintaining our integrated global services footprint, managing costs and continuing to fight for market share. We expect to see the bottom for activity in this market to occur in the first half of 2017. In this global recovery, we expect cycle times to accelerate. I believe successful companies will be characterized by a lighter asset base, faster asset velocity and job side execution, all geared to respond quickly to deliver returns. So, to me, no matter what market is handed to us, Halliburton is well-positioned, and our dedication to execution gives me confidence that we will continue to outperform our peers. With that, let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI. You may begin.
James West: I wanted to dig in, Dave or Jeff, on the pricing question around North American pressure pumping. At this point, I know you’ve indicated you’ve got the market share, so you’ll give up some in order to get profitability up. Are you starting to see the early signs of some pricing gains in certain basins, and maybe it’s not in the Permian but maybe some of the basins where equipment has migrated out of?
Jeff Miller: Pricing is still, yes, I’ll describe it overall as a brawl. As I said, we’re always pushing on pricing. We’re seeing small increases in different basins, but where we’re most focused around those customers with whom to collaborate the best. And I’ve always said that the tightening of utilization was a critical first step and we are beginning to see that. We’re also moving away in some cases from work where we don’t see a similar clear path to returns.
James West: And then maybe a follow-up on that, so I guess your strategy for unstacking equipment at this point, you suggested it’s more of a conversation about returns on the assets. That would assume that you need at least some level of price increase to bring stacked equipment, even if it’s in great shape back to work?
Jeff Miller: Spot on James, I mean the equipment’s got to make returns. And in my view this does require step up in price. And so for that reason, we don’t have current plans to have or start to the market. I would expect the next round of investment broadly to drive better discipline related to returns.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. You may begin.
Jud Bailey: A question for Dave or Jeff, I was hoping -- could you expand maybe Dave on your comments, in your prepared comments, on the need to be asset light, I think you said in the context of a shorter cycle that you envisioned, does this reflect any type of change in how you are going to run the business or strategy or how you think about investing in the business given your comments?
Jeff Miller: We’re focused on everything that drives returns. And in my view, the shorter cycles are really closer to our value preposition, which is execution and the last mile. And so for example, it’s not vertical integration for the sake of integration and it’s not -- and it’s variabilizing everything that makes sense to variabilizing our business. So, then therefore, we’re improving margins through better utilization and obviously pricing. Velocity, as we come out of this will be more important than ever and we continue to do things that drive that velocity in all parts of our business. And we clearly believe this is how we drive leading industry returns.
Jud Bailey: And I guess my follow-up is the guidance for North America in the fourth quarters is pretty straight forward. I was wondering do you -- what kind of visibility you may have in terms of calendar for the first quarter, early 2017. Obviously it will be dependent on where oil prices shake out and what OPEC ultimately does. It sounds like you’ve got some customers who are starting to lineup work for 2017 at this point. And I was wondering if you could perhaps give any color to that effect.
Jeff Miller: Well, we see -- as we talked about Q4, I mean at this point, the board is full. But we’re not clear whether that’s customer optionality or not. History would say, we slow down in the holidays. That would push more work into the first part of next year. But again that part of the market is not as clear at this point in time. So, we are going to manage our cost and manage our businesses. We look at that to keep the structural cost and savings in place and be absolutely positioned for when the recovery happens or where that happens.
Mark McCollum: This is Mark. I think our general view is that Q1 is going to be better, right. And the customers are engaging but the amount -- how much better it’s going to be is still going to be highly dependent on what the commodity price is going into the first part of next year. So, we think we’re clearly on a path for recovery.
Operator: Thank you. Our next is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your may begin.
Scott Gruber : So, I was down in the Permian about a month ago and met with a collection of operators, and everyone just was discussing more sand per well and longer laterals, two trends that everyone has been discussing for a while. The trend that stuck out to me and which appears less well appreciated is the trend towards more frack stages per well. A couple of operators were discussing shifting towards fully 40, 50-stage wells and one was actually discussing pushing towards 90-stage wells. Are you seeing this trend in the Permian? And if so, can you discuss the impact on the requisite pump time to complete these wells?
Jeff Miller: Look, we are seeing a move towards shorter spacing on the stages which ultimately drives more stages, and this will drive more service intensity for us. More stages means more plugs, means more perfs, earns more sand. So, you get the point but just don’t forget that the most important thing is making a better well, ultimately which involves stimulating more rock. And so, I would say that the precise placement of the sand is probably the most important thing. And that’s where we spend our time is optimal frac design and placement and really further precisely why we focus so much around sub surface inside, and ultimately how to make a better well.
Scott Gruber: And just generally, are you seeing operators outside of the Permian squeeze the spacing as well as is this just a Permian phenomenon?
Jeff Miller: I would say that what’s right is what’s right for the rock. And I think you’re seeing that moving into Permian basin, probably less so in another places, so constantly trying new ways to again get more sand in the right place as opposed to just more sand.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin.
Angie Sedita : I echo the congrats on impressive quarter given market conditions and also Dave your sense of realism on shorter cycles and range-bound oil prices is certainly appreciated. On the question, I think the first question for Mark is do you -- we are talking about this asset light model, do you still see other structural costs that you can be pulling out of the system in North America and internationally into 2017?
Mark McCollum: I think that we’ve never finished in terms of reviewing our overall structural costs. Jeff made the comment earlier about variabalizing costs. And I think there are some things that we haven’t necessarily always thought of as structural. They are -- they would be variable in a definition of how we would typically look at them. But when we talk about variabalizing those, we’re talking about possibly looking at do lease versus buy; do we turn the depreciation charge into a lease charge; do we rent versus own; what can we do to continue to try to increasingly create optionality in our business, so that we can flex with the market overall but more importantly flex with our customers, to making sure as they continue to evaluate, how they want to do their wells or where they want to do their wells that we can move with them and be as nimble as possible. So, I think that we’re going to go into next year. Jeff alluded to this, even though we believe the year will be better, we’re going to plan very aggressively flat in terms of our structural cost. And even planning flat requires the organization to continue to really focus on what can we do from a continuous improvement standpoint to continue to drive that cost. I believe you’re never done, and we’re going to continue to go forward.
Angie Sedita: So going back to North America pressure pumping, you’ve made comments in the past on what you thought the margin outlook would be, if you have your fully deployed fleets at full utilization. Can you give us your updated thoughts there? The currently deployed fleet at full utilization.
Jeff Miller: Yes. What I would do is let’s go back to kind of a margin progression for the business and in my view it’s a path back rather than a dramatic job. And so, as we said, certain things have to happen around equipment tightening and attrition and it starts with making positive operating income then returning the cost to capital, and then pushing for industry leading returns. Clearly, we’re starting from a lower base, but the formula is very much the same and it’s the formula that we know.
Mark McCollum: We’re definitely going to need some price to back toward the historic margins that we’ve had in the past and historic returns. But the first order of business is to get capacity tightened up in the market. We believe the activity levels in the Permian and others all are serving to work equip harder, it’s going to tighten up equipment faster and we’re starting to see price against the edges and we’ll continue to drive that forward as we hold the line of cost and it’s -- we’re going to get there. The model is the same and we’ve just got to execute.
Angie Sedita: And so, is it fair to assume that that pricing outlook, that improvement is back half 2017 based on what you know today?
Mark McCollum: I think we’ll start seeing pricing earlier than that. I mean we’re working on it every day with every customer and the fringes -- and it’ll be probably a slow march forward initially until things tighten up and then begin to accelerate. And hopefully we’re going to be pushing this hard as we can to get back to 20% as quick as we can.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. You may begin.
Bill Herbert: So, Mark, a quick question with regard to the guidance for the fourth quarter and sensibly, you seem to be a little bit conservative about North American top line and sort of in line with the rig count obviously [ph] expectation. But you’ve got a loaded frac calendar according to Jeff’s commentary, Dave’s commentary completions lagged activity in the third quarter and now starting to pull through in the fourth quarter. Why wouldn’t completions and frac activity in Halliburton’s North American top line outpace the rig count in Q4?
Dave Lesar: Let me take that one. I think as Jeff said, the frac calendar is full but my 20 years of being -- 20 years or so of being in-charge of this thing shows me that customers like to grab optionality in the fourth quarter by filling the frac calendar. And it doesn’t always come true that we utilize that work, and that calendar can get dumped pretty aggressively toward the end of the year, toward the end of the fourth quarter. So, we’re just cautioning people that we don’t know yet. It’s really up to our customers as to whether they’re going to go forward and turn the optionality into real work. And my experience has been some years it happens but most years they start to pull things off the calendar as the holidays get there. And you’ve got the added I think dimension this year, where the commodity price is, what they can buy -- are, they going to spend their money buying strips for next year, are they going to basically want to continue to use these high spec rigs in a sporadic way or just wait till next year where they can run them out on a pad and run them for 60, 80, 90, 100 days and get the efficiencies from them. So, we’re just trying to draw a little bit of caution out there that there’s probably more variables in this Q4 than typically there might be because we’re bouncing off the bottom at this point in time.
Bill Herbert: And in line with…
Jeff Miller: Bill, I was just going to say the follow-on, you also recognize we saw little bit in Q3 that as we try to improve our margins and returns on this, we are in some cases letting some bad contracts go, things that don’t work for us making money in order to improve the utilization and profitability on others. And so, it may not necessarily follow directly with the rig count to get out….
Bill Herbert: And then Dave, in line with your pretty stark but realistic commentary about deepwater, I’m just curious as to how you’re thinking about your global deepwater footprint right now and whether that represents another significant round of call it right-sizing for Halliburton in terms of cost cutting reductions?
Dave Lesar: Bill, let me let Jeff handle that one because he’s dealing with it every day.
Jeff Miller: We like our footprint around the world and I think deepwater certainly has important role to play. It’s clearly the most stressed today and that’s partly just because as we collaborate and look at ways to lower the cost per BOE that they just don’t get as many add backs. Clearly, it’s structurally disadvantaged because of duration which gets to not only the time value of money but also the speed with which those barrels meet demand requirements. All of that said, still believe it has an important role. And we know how to flex the cost around those facilities but I will tell you keeping that footprint in place is something we will do. Again, I have described our value preposition around last mile execution. That means you have to be present to win, and we plan to be present.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin.
David Anderson: Thank you. I think Mark, you just kind of touched on I was going to ask you there. I was wondering if you could expand a bit on the increased utilization in North America. Is that just continuing to squeeze up a wide space, is it dropping certain customers as far as active? It doesn’t sound like you’re reactivating equipment. And I’m just trying to understand how I should think about utilization going forward concerning your saying margins are now taking a priority over market share.
Mark McCollum: Well, I guess we’re in a unique point in the market right now where we are setting up with -- we’ve got choice because we have market share. And so, as we go through that, it’s not one way or the other necessarily, it’s all about where we see the path to profitability, those clients that utilize what we do best in the best way so that is mutually beneficial for both of us. So, it’s not as clear as one or the other by any means, particularly as we work through this part of the market. What I really like is where we’re positioned. And as I’ve said, we’re not going to add equipment until we see clearly better returns, and I think that’s going to be prohibited to others to add equipment until the price moves where it needs to be.
Dave Lesar: Clearly, our utilization has gone up quite dramatically as a part of this process and that was a large part of what helped the margins this quarter; we’re going to continue to work that formula here for the next quarter or so.
David Anderson: Okay. And just a follow-up question; one of the other things we hear from E&Ps now there’s been a talk about moving more to slickwater fracks. Just wondering how that could potentially change kind of revenue and margin potential on your pressure pumping business as we move ahead to next year.
Dave Lesar: I mean slickwater is clearly harder on equipment and it’s something we ought to get paid for. Fortunately, the Q10s were designed to operate more effectively at the higher rates that are demanded by slickwater. So, we’re preferentially positioned around that. And I would also go further to say that today’s market is the mix bag of frac designs, So, we still see quite a bit of gel, some hybrid and yes certainly slickwater. But when I think about the longer-term future, where does it go, the key point is controlling the frac in our view. And that’s why we study chemistry. And we think that it’s not one size fits all; it’s actually what is the right size for that rock and that’s why we’re that focused on making better wells.
Jeff Miller: It’s always important to remember that Halliburton operates in every basin across the whole of North America. And what’s happening just in the Midland or Delaware, in the Permian isn’t -- every basin, every rock is different. And so, we go to market where the customer needs to get the best well in those markets. And so, it will be -- we’re uniquely positioned to get the best out of our equipment and of our projects.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital. You may begin.
Kurt Hallead: Dave, a question for you, you mentioned the shift in the strategy to go asset light. By definition, frac is very asset intensive. So, I was hoping you give a little bit more color around the context of asset light.
Dave Lesar: I think as we’ve said, it’s not a shift in strategy; it’s a continuation of a strategy where more continuation of a philosophy is that we’re returns driven first. And to the extent we can get by with less assets, we can variablize our asset base, then we are going to continue to do that and that’s really all it means. So, I don’t want anybody to read too much into this. It’s just a prioritization of returns and when you’re prioritizing returns first, the fewer assets you can do the same amount of work with, the better your returns are going to be, the better your margins are going to be. And that’s really where we are.
Kurt Hallead: Got it. And then, follow-up on the comment about potentially being willing to get some share for margins, was that U.S. market specific?
Dave Lesar: We take a look at every basin, every customer, every geography every day and make those decisions on a real time basis. It’s the benefit of having the market share we have, having the great customer base we have, having a great footprint that we have and allows us the optionality of making those decisions each and every day.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
Jim Wicklund: There has been a lot made about the rigs that have gone to work so far have been low calorie rigs, private companies by private equity sponsor drilling wells, primarily in the Permian and trying to drill as cheap as they can. It would seem that in your market share progression that you’ve gone after bigger companies that work 24/7 that the drill complex wells. Has the move so for off the bottom been a rig count that is not clearly beneficial to you guys and is that one of the issues that will be solved as we get into 2017 and more established companies pick up drilling?
Jeff Miller: Jim, the rigs that we’re seeing, as you describe them are probably less service intensive and they have also tended to be less about big new capital programs and more around -- and what we’ve seen has been more around repairing or trying to sustain a bit of production, which looks and feels quite a bit different. I fully believe tough that this comes right over the next period of time because, again where we can do engage is when they start to make the bigger decisions around how to design fracs where we are going to be positioned and getting up to sort of full speed and full velocity. That’s when our assets work the hardest and that’s where we’re the most efficient. And again part of being, as Dave said around asset light is not -- is velocity as much as it is anything else. And so, we’re drilling long horizontals and we’re full on. That’s where we absolutely are best.
Jim Wicklund: Yes. I have no doubt about that, it’s just that we haven’t seen a lot of the drilling that’s taken place here in the last six months be those kind of programs and those kinds of wells, but I’m sure that’ll turn. My follow-up if I could, sand, if I just do back of the envelope stuff, you guys buy and supply to your customers a great deal of sand and coming out with at least $1.5 billion a year of it, and dollars that comes through, does that all come through your income statement, Mark, and is there a margin to that, or if I were to take these sand pass-through revenues off your income statement, would that have the appreciable benefit to margins, am I looking at this right?
Mark McCollum: So, yes, we do buy sand for our customers account and that that’s on the ticket. We bill -- we in a typical market, we would bill that sand with the margin that’s designed to recover the cost of the delivery. We do the delivery; we take it to mine; we move it by rail through transloading and essentially then arrange logistics to move the last mile to the well site. So, we don’t articulate all that cost out but the margin is designed to recover that cost and put it in line with the other margins that we have across the pumping and other service side of our business. Obviously, what’s happening right now is we’re not earning a margin on a lot of that business, I mean in some cases we may. But the practical reality when you’re negative in North America and particularly on the pressure pumping side, you’re not making money on the sand. I mean, you can look at it as right now we’re buying sand for our customers account. And that’s not a sustainable practice. And so that’s a large part of what we’re trying to repair. But, we do believe that our ability -- the scale of the operation that we have, the amount of sand that we move, the quality and the efficiency of the transloading operation and we provide a significant value add to our customers. We can make sure that arise on time and quantity. When the supplies get tight, our logistics get complex, they don’t have to worry about working with Halliburton to get it there. And we’re never waiting on sand…
Jim Wicklund: I figure if MLP valuations ever come back, you’re going to get a great deal of pressure to spin that off, that’s how good you are. Okay, Mark. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. You may begin.
Sean Meakim: You guided the flattish margins next quarter for international, given the minimal seasonal benefit. Thinking about the first half of ‘17, how much of that bottoming comes from the seasonal drop off in the first quarter versus ongoing budget challenges in some markets, maybe like Latin America? Just trying to think about does that guidance imply 2017 budgets likely flatter or say flat to lower year-over-year but with that sequential improvement in the back half?
Jeff Miller: The international business traditionally lags North America by six to nine months. So, that’s just sort of broadly across all of the markets in terms of activity. And we’re continuing to see and if you look at sort of geographically outside of the resilience in the Middle East business, there’s been a substantial decline in activity commensurate with the commodities. And certainly Latin America’s had historical low; Asia Pacific is down in some ways as much as 50% in terms of rig count that we see in the marketplace. And so, and I think that that continues into kind of the first part of next year and there is obviously the resetting budgets with the national oil companies and a lot of things that conspire to slow that down. So certainly not clear but we expect consistent with sort of our outlook that middle of next year’s where we start to see that repairing.
Mark McCollum: I think that we don’t really have a lot of visibility from customers yet. The first quarter will be down seasonally as usually in North Sea and Russia that has the largest impacts and then to a lesser extent in Latin America you’ll have some delays as NOCs reset their budgets and then begin to work. But I think that veracity of the -- once we hit the bottom in international in early part of the next year, the veracity of any recovery is going to be based on what the commodity price outlook gives at that point in time.
Sean Meakim: Got it, understood, it’s that it’s still early. And then just one more question on the Permian if I could, the Permian is very much the focus among the E&Ps today, particularly the Delaware and the Midland. Just curious if the recovery in activity is less broad based than last cycle and more limited to the Permian? Just how do we think about competition in that market, mix of wells, and customers and how some of that could have an impact on margins and pricing in that basin?
Jeff Miller: Permian basin is the most competitive basin in North America today, the majority of the rig adds were in the Permian basin, quite a mix of customers that added rigs doing a variety of things as we’ve already talked about some vertical wells, some proving up acreage, just a range of activity. Starting from a smaller base and other parts of the country, are we seeing some pick up, yes in the rig count and that’s part of the reason we stay engaged in all parts of the market. So, I think that Permian from an activity standpoint will be busy but again, it’s a highly supplied marketplace as well.
Sean Meakim: So, maybe some of those other areas could provide opportunities for you all, given how much competition is likely left with those lower activity basins?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean, our strategy is clear that we want to be in the business and we want to be in the business in a full service way in all of the markets.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.
Daniel Boyd: I’d like to follow up on one of the questions earlier from Jim. And as you think about your logistical network and the infrastructure, I think that’s something we all view as one of the key competitive advantages of Halliburton. Can you maybe give us an update on where your infrastructure currently stands, maybe how much capital was invested in that business, and would you consider different structures to get that off of your book in the future?
Dave Lesar: So, we’re not going to give specifics on the total capital invested or anything like that. But I would tell you that we’ve got transloading capabilities in all of the major basins that we feel like that we’ve got sufficient capital and resources to make sure that we can service our own business. It was purposely designed in a way that doesn’t meet 100% of our needs. That’s I’m talking about how you variablize your business. One of those things has been that we have tried to construct that in a manner that meets a significant portion of our transloading needs that allows us to also to be able to flex with the market, should the need arise. And so, we believe right now that it’s an important strategic asset. We’re going to continue to hold that but, I can’t tell you where or if. It’s just one of those things that like any other portion of our business, we will continually look at that, look at the returns that we earn off of that business, its relative importance to customers in the market and make evaluations as we get there.
Daniel Boyd: A follow-up is just looking at the Permian and the transloading facilities and basically the sand deliverability infrastructure there, how well utilized is that network and could that be a limit to activity in the Permian at some point?
Jeff Miller: Look I don’t see -- I don’t see any limitations currently. There are always parts of that chain that we’re working on how to improve, how to make better, but ultimately we’re able to overcome those sorts of things pretty consistently and as we’ve demonstrated in the past, we’ve led and how we’ve resolved those types of opportunities in market so. And I think to the extent the Permian continues to strengthen, those investments will be made where required.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Mackenzie with Iberia Capital. You may begin.
Rob Mackenzie: Thank you, guys. I had a follow-up question on the margin front from earlier. I guess my question is, is with the lean cost structure you talked about, variabalizing cost where you can underutilized existing asset base, why would incremental margins only be in the 35% to 40% range; why shouldn’t we be able to expect to see something higher than that?
Mark McCollum: At some point, they will go higher. And it’s usually a progression, right now coming off of bottom, there is still -- we’re fighting every day for some level of pricing and trying to get crews above water. When you have crews below water, it creates some level of stress on your incrementals. And it’s not consistent. Crews -- crew one month could be doing fine, the next month, based on customer choices about working or downtime, maintenance whatever else could go under water. So, until you get everybody consistently above water, the incrementals stay a little bit choppy, but they’ve moved up from what we were expecting. And as a result of the utilization we’re getting, we’re now sort of seeing in that 35% to 40% and making go higher from there.
Jeff Miller: Historically, we would see a trough following, the trough in rigs was followed by a trough in margins. And so in my view, we’ve actually accelerated that and a lot of that on the back of the cost reductions and the structural cost moves that we’ve made, which we’ve always said, we wouldn’t see the real benefit of those until we saw some sort of bottom. And so, we’re seeing that. And so in some ways, we’re moving more quickly than we would expect it. 
Mark McCollum: Yes. And I would just add one more thing and it continues to be -- the comment was on incremental margins for the fourth quarter for North America. And as we said earlier, we’re continuing to factor in some downtime over the holidays, which means your revenues go away but your costs don’t, and that clearly has an impact on your incremental margins at that point in time. But all of that being said and as we said in the call, we said in the release, things are getting better in North America. And I think if you take something away from this call, it’s that thought, not the sort of tactical things we have to do day-to-day to work our way through the quarter.
Rob Mackenzie: That’s a good answer, guys. And my follow-up question comes back to I guess the frac calendar, if you will. What are you seeing if anything in terms of larger job requests from your clients, either term work, multi-well pads versus kind of the real very structured spot work we’ve seen; where does that stand in terms of evolution of backlog for you guys?
Jeff Miller: Yes. We’re obviously seeing some increase in that in terms of both terms and size. Obviously, we’re not going to comment on strategy at this point in time, but we manage through kind of the optionality and manage our entire portfolio.
Dave Lesar: I would just say, listen, our customers are smart, they see 2017 shaping up to be better and they’re going to try to lock in as much time and price as they can at this point in time. And it’s up to us to navigate our way through those requests and make sure that we -- we’re not only there to service them with the equipment they need but we’re there with a price that gives us the kind of returns we need to satisfy our own shareholders. So, it’s going to be a give-and-take but there’s certainly some of that going on right now.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I’d like to turn the call back over to Jeff Miller for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Shannon. And I’d like wrap up the call with just a couple of key points. First, North America unconventional market has a predicted recovered, first, and should continue to strengthen in a plus $50 oil price environment. Secondly, Halliburton strategy is directly pointed at the most important part of the market and collaborating and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. This along with our customer relationships, geographic footprint and service quality positions Halliburton outperform in the recovery. Now, thank you and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentleman, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions]. As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Lance Loeffler, Halliburton's Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Lance Loeffler: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2016 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other securities and exchange commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAP financial measures and unless otherwise noted in our discussion today, we will be excluding the Baker Hughes termination fee and the impact of impairment and several other charges. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release, which can be found on our website.  Now I'll turn the call over to Dave.
David Lesar : Thank you, Lance and good morning to everyone. Our second quarter results showed great resilience in the face of a very challenging environment, which included declining rig activity and even more pricing headwinds. Our total company revenue declined only 9% sequentially compared to the 19% decline in the global rig count. Our North America revenue was down 15% from the prior quarter, significantly outperforming a 23% decline in the average US rig count. However, despite these continuing headwinds, based on the recent improvements to North American activity, I believe that this second quarter will mark the trough for our earnings.  Now we're at a dynamic point in the cycle and I'm not going to waste the limited time we have with you on the call this morning discussing things like the macroeconomics, the worldwide demand, the general economy or commodity prices. There are many public sources out there where you can get this data, including our customers because that is the world that they live in every day. What I want to talk about today is the world that we know best. Now, conventional wisdom coming out of the first quarter was that the rig count would continue to drop. We said we saw North America differently and were the first to call a bottom for the rig count. This is precisely what happened.  So let's talk about the reality of today's North America market. I can summarize this market in one sentence. Today our customers are thinking about growing their business again rather than being focused on survival. There are 2 distinct factors at work in North America; psychological and economic and I think it's critical to understand them both. Now, you haven't heard me talk about the psychology of North American producers before, but given what has happened to many of our customers in the last 18 months, I think it's an important point to understand. I spent a large amount of time with customers late in the quarter taking their pulse and I can tell you there was a growing survivor mentality out there, and you can't underestimate the positive change in attitude that we're seeing in our North American customers. There is a spring in their step that I didn't see earlier in the year and in almost every case, they are talking about adding rigs, buying assets or doing something value accretive. In short they are getting back to business.  The psychological factors are getting better. Oil reaching $50 per barrel, even for a brief time, was a critical emotional milestone for our customers as was being able to buy a strip above $50 per barrel. So maybe it can be summed up best by one customer who told me, Dave, it's actually a light at the end of the tunnel and not an incoming train. To borrow a Keynesian economic term, the animal spirits are back in North America, but also understanding the economic reality in North America is equally important.  Pricing has helped cash flow but not enough. Hedges rolling off have created cash flow uncertainty. Balance sheet repair is still critical and many customers are looking at severe declines in production as many of them have drilled few wells in the last 18 months. And while there are many customers that have adequate liquidity, there is also a large segment evaluating how to access capital. This evaluation is around whether to do dilutive equity deals, accessing the high yield markets, looking at Reserve Base lending or partnering with private equity. But the important point is, they are back in business. Now our North America customer management teams are great to work with. They are creative, adaptive and increasingly confident and I believe they will find the solutions best tailored for their companies. This is also a smart group and they see today's looming supply shortfall and know that US unconventionals will likely be the first and deepest beneficiary of growing supply shortages. And you can be sure they want to reap some of that benefit.  So let's talk about how the cycle is starting to stack up and how this coming up cycle will play out. Now obviously, the last 2 years has been a period of significant under investment, where global CapEx has been reduced by nearly $400 billion. As a result, the industry will have to find a lot of new barrels in the next 5 years. Now, you can choose your own energy supply expert and there are many of them out there, but most agree we will need between 18 and 22 million barrels per day of new production by 2021. Meaning we have to find nearly 2 Saudi Arabias worth of production in the next 5 years. To achieve this production goal, we believe there will need to be structural changes that have to happen. It clearly starts with a supportive commodity price and we're not there yet today. The prices will have to get there soon or the supply challenges will be even greater.  Industry balance sheets will need to be repaired. The industry will need to replenish experience lost to retirement and cutbacks. We’ll have to find sustainable ways to deepen the relationships between operators and service companies, collaborating to integrate better, eliminate duplication and drive down delivery cost. And finally, producers will have to accept the reality of service company economics. Some of the efficiency gains we have made with our customers are in fact sustainable and will continue, but others, including deep uneconomic pricing cuts, are unsustainable and will have to be reversed.  In this environment, we are confident that North America will recover the fastest. The North America market has turned and we expect to see a continued modest uptick in the US rig count during the second half of the year and becoming more meaningful as we go into 2017. And now that we have seen the flow in activity levels, we expect revenue to increase based on higher utilization rates. And as we have said consistently, rig count stabilization is the first step on the road to margin repair, and Jeff will discuss that in a few minutes.  Current service pricing in North America is unsustainable. We are in an environment where service providers are unable to meet their cost of capital and many are struggling to recover even their cash costs. Historically, as we reached the bottom, the downward momentum on pricing creates a headwind and margin repair tends to lag activity recovery by a quarter or so. To break this typical cycle, we have made structural changes to our delivery platform, eliminating management layers and consolidating roles and locations. As a result of these savings, we are confident that North America margins can begin to recover in the third quarter.  When this downturn started, we said that we were entering it from a position of strength in all of our markets. Since that time, we have executed our downturn playbook and have continuously outperformed the market, both in North America as well as the Eastern Hemisphere, gaining market share in both. So to summarize, the market has played out as we predicted and our strategy is working. North America has turned and with our market share increase during the downturn, we believe we are the best positioned company. During the coming recovery, we plan to scale up our delivery platform by addressing our product line building blocks one at a time, through a combination of organic growth and selective acquisitions.  With that, let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark?
Mark McCollum: Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Let me start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, which declined 9% compared to a 19% percent decline in the worldwide rig count. Total company operating income declined 72%, primarily due to the continued decline in global activity in pricing, as well as the reintroduction of depreciation expense for our previously held for sale assets.  Moving to our region results, North America revenue declined 15%, with margins moving down to an operating loss of 8%. The primary drivers were the impact of reduced pricing and activity in our stimulation, wireline and drilling product lines.  In Latin America, revenue declined 12% and operating income declined 54%, as a result of reduced activity levels in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia and by our decision to curtail our activity in Venezuela. Rig activity in both Brazil and Mexico is at a 20 year low, while Venezuela continues to experience significant political and economic turmoil.  Turning to Middle East Asia, revenue declined 3%, while operating income declined 22%. We saw increased activity in Kuwait and fairly consistent activity in Saudi Arabia. However, we also began to experience pricing pressure across the region and activity levels declined in Iraq, Australia and Indonesia. In Europe Africa CIS, second quarter revenue increased 2% and operating income increased 12%, as a result of the seasonal recovery of activity in the North Sea and Russia.  Our corporate and other expense for the second quarter totaled $60 million and we expect third quarter expense to come in at similar levels.  We recorded a tax benefit for the second quarter of approximately $6 million. Based upon our current outlook for the third quarter, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 50%. These unusual rate results from having tax losses in the US that are then offset by taxable income in the foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates.  During the second quarter, we had several special charges that we need to highlight. First, as we've previously disclosed, we recognize the $3.5 billion termination fee associated with the Baker Hughes transaction. We also recognize pretax restructuring and other charges of $423 million. These charges consist primarily of severance cost and asset impairments, as we continue to adjust our cost structure and footprint to the current operating environment. The largest single item in that charge was a fair market value adjustment, required by accounting rules for exchanging $200 million of our Venezuela receivable, for an interest bearing promissory note. This instrument provides a more defined schedule around the timing of payments, while generating a return while we await payment.  There is an immediate expense because accounting rules require that these notes be revalued to their current trading value, even if you intend to hold them to maturity. Our current intent is to hold them to maturity and we expect to collect 100% of the principle. As such, the notes will accrete back to their par value as they mature over the next few years. All of these adjustments are tax deductible, but the tax benefit we recorded also includes the impact of removing our accounting assertion on permanently reinvesting our foreign earnings and some adjustments related to the carry-back of our now sizable US NOL. The NOL carry-back will provide us with a significant cash flow benefit later this year.  Speaking of cash flow, this quarter was particularly noisy because of the termination of the Baker Hughes deal and continued restructuring work we are doing. When the smoke clears from the unusual items however, cash flow from operations was slightly positive and we closed the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and equivalents. Over our history, it's not unusual for our annual cash flow to be back end loaded in the year and 2016 is no exception. We continue to commit to living within our cash flows during this challenging environment and improving earnings and a number of working capital initiatives that we are implementing should get us alternately to breakeven for the year.  Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be approximately $850 million.  Turning to our short term operational outlook, let me provide you with our thoughts on the third quarter. In North America, the US land rig count is already up 5% sequentially on average and is expected to improve modestly over the remainder of the third quarter. We anticipate revenue will outperform the rig count by several hundred basis points and that margins will improve by 100 to 200 basis points as a result of our cost control initiatives and better utilization.  In Latin America, we are anticipating a mid-teens percentage decline in revenue with margins moving down to the low single digits. Although we may see some end of year sales, Latin America is expected to remain our most challenged region throughout the international down cycle and we do not expect to see a fundamental improvement this year.  And finally, third quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenue is expected to be down modestly low single digits due to declining activity and continued pricing headwinds. Looking ahead, we anticipate Eastern Hemisphere activity to decline over the balance of the year. However, we expect margins to remain flat in the third quarter as they also benefit from our cost control initiatives.  Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you, Mark and good morning everyone. Let me start today with a headline. 900 is the new 2,000 for US rig activity. Now what I mean by that? I believe it’ll the only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market. Why? We know the North American market best and we're in every single part of that market. What's clear to us is that the increases in rig efficiency, lateral length and sand per well create a compounding effect that consumes increasingly more horsepower per rig.  In addition, we watch the effect of the downturn on North America service capacity every day in every basin. We've seen the attrition of equipment, people and companies. Let me take these in order. First, horsepower attrition continues due to scrapping and cannibalization. We believe up to four million horsepower and maybe even more has been permanently removed from the market, representing about 20% of the horsepower capacity reported at the peak and more is permanently impaired each day. Industry headcount reductions continue and many of these people are leaving the industry. Finally, company bankruptcies and consolidations also work to accelerate equipment attrition.  Now I want to address what we do as we scrape along the bottom and look ahead to the recovery. The steps are, must be present to win and we are. We are present in every market. Second is reduced directional cost. We're doing it. Third, increased utilization, we’re positioned for it. And finally get pricing help. This happens when utilization increases. To be ready for the recovery, we played offense. First, we actively protected our market position with key customers, kept the majority of our fleet deployed and delivered fantastic service quality.  Despite absorbing the pain of pricing reaching unsustainable levels, we made a strategic decision to stay in every market and keep crews running. In spite of the nearly 80% decline in rig count, our stage count only declined 33%. So here's what we're doing now. We preserved idle equipment outside of our field locations so it doesn't get cannibalized. It's clear to me that it will be cheaper to reactivate our cold stacked equipment than to put capital into cannibalized horsepower. This means we are best positioned to more quickly get back to work in the market recovery and are prepared to activate equipment when we see economic opportunities to do so.  In terms of structural cost control, we're making significant progress towards reducing our annual cost structure by $1 billion. We've reduced headcount and consolidated facilities in every region. At the end of the second quarter, we're about halfway there, both internationally and in North America. We anticipate the remaining savings will come in the second half of the year and will reach the $1 billion run rate cost savings as we go into 2017.  The next step is increased utilization. We know our platform is most effective when it's fully utilized. So job one is to fill the white space in the calendar. This is why we work with customers that best utilize our platform, in turn helping our customers produce at the lowest cost per BOE. Throughout the downturn, our superior delivery platform, which is our value proposition, our people, processes and equipment, results in a margin gap to nearly every competitor and we expect to maintain that advantage in the recovery.  The last step will be the return of pricing. Price negotiations have been a bar room row. In certain situations, as we've seen signs of recovery, we've elected to walk away from money losing jobs in recent months. We've been reviewing every contracting and program down to individual wells on a pad by pad basis, including opportunities for pass-through and cost related pricing and surcharging.  It's a tough market but we believe pricing will recover as activity increases. When we have these 4 things, we're confident our North America margins will return to double digits, but beyond North America land, our key focus areas are unconventional, mature fields and deep water and I'm pleased with how we're executing around the world. Though they may be limited, we're working closely with our customers to unlock unconventionals in every region around the world, including recent projects in Abu Dhabi and Argentina.  In the Middle East we've made significant inroads in our IPM business, taking a market leading position during the downturn. This reflects the dedication our employees have for understanding their customer needs, identifying solutions, and helping to reduce risks, all while improving efficiency in this uncertain market. This creates a great environment for our collaborative and integrated business model, helping our customers to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil.  Though we know deep water is the most challenged, we are collaborating closely with our customers who are working hard to drive down structural cost and make economic wells. BaraECD is an engineered drilling fluid system that allows us to manage narrow frac gradients while drilling. In addition to reducing overall growing times, BaraECD has helped break records on rate of penetration and is one of multiple systems that have allowed us to take a number one position in the Gulf of Mexico fluids market.  In Southeast Asia we have a great example of a collaborative effort with a client that optimized the drilling solution, including drill bits and fluids for exploration well, reducing the drilling time by 14 days. This cost savings helped to deliver the lowest cost per BOE and is proof that when we work together with our customers and internally, we can provide efficient solutions in any market. The ability to input customer requirements into our drill bit development in short order, is what enables us to deliver this collaborative solution.  Collaboration is central to everything we do. Not only do we say it, we do it. A great example is our new resource for customers and partners called iEnergy, available through Landmark. It's an open architecture approach to problem solving. iEnergy was conceived as a community of stakeholders sharing data and building applications. Think of it as our open architecture approach in contrast to proprietary and closed models in the market today. This is highly indicative of how we collaborate at Halliburton, not only collaborating internally, but collaborating more closely with our customers. I could go on all day about specific products and services. Let me wrap up with what we do. Our competitive advantage is this. We collaborate, engineer solutions and execute to maximize our client's asset value, which means a lower cost and making more barrels. This is why we maintain our global service footprint. We will own the last mile, be present across the globe and maintain dead focus on service quality.  To sum it up, we like our position. As we expected, the North American unconventional market has responded the fastest, demonstrated by the recent activity pick up. International markets will take more time to rebound, but we're certainly well positioned for when they do. I want to close by thanking our employees for maintaining their focus on service quality and executing at every level in this challenging market. Simply put, service quality is central to how we win and retain work. We've seen a record low incidence rates so far this year and it's important we keep this focus on safety and service quality as the market begins to pick up.  Now I’ll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?
David Lesar : Thank you, Jeff and let me sum things up. We are prepared for the North American upcycle. Our approach to the market remains unchanged. The North American market is turning. It will recovery the fastest and Halliburton will be the biggest beneficiary. In the next North America rig cycle, 900 is the new 2,000. The international markets will follow and we are maintaining our integrated global services footprint, managing costs and continuing to gain share. We are working hard at reducing structural costs. We expect to achieve a billion dollars lower run rate going in to 2017. We remain laser focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance, and providing industry leading shareholder returns. And finally, we expect that the second quarter will be the trough of our earnings and we are confident that Halliburton will be best position to outperform in the recovery phase of the cycle.  Now before we open it up for questions, I would like to thank Christian Garcia for his outstanding work over his 20 years at Halliburton, and particularly his work as interim CFO during the past 18 months. I very much wish him well in the future.  Now, let's open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. 
Scott Gruber: Good morning. Jeff, as someone who spends an inordinate amount of time on headlines and titles, I really like your rig count headlines. It’s a good one.
Jeffrey Miller: Than you. 
Scott Gruber: You stated that about four million horsepower has been removed from the North American frac fleet. Can you just provide some color on this figure? How much do you think has been disassembled, cut up and won't come back? How much is in more of a mothballed state? And overall where do you think these figures could stand by year end?
Jeffrey Miller: Let me go, maybe start with how we get to the 900 as the new 2,000 and then address your question along the way. So going into the downturn, equilibrium was about 2,000 rigs and 600 frac crews in the US. So a little more than 3 rigs kept every frac crew busy. Really 3 factors at play here. So first drilling efficiency and then completions, intensity and attrition. So from a drilling efficiency standpoint, rigs have gotten almost 30% faster meaning more wells per rig per year. So that new ratio is closer to 2 to 2.5 rigs for every crew.  Second is around completions intensity and the jobs have gotten twice as big, meaning more horsepower per crew almost 20% more, meaning that the same horsepower that made up 600 crews now only make up 500. And so then we get to the attrition part of that and there are estimates that range from 3 to 7 million horsepower that have left the market. We think it's about 4. We see that because we're out in the market every day looking at horsepower. But the fact is there's more horsepower that it trips every day just given the type of intensity. So I think the important point is that you know the market can tighten maybe faster than you think. 
Scott Gruber: We certainly agree with that point. A quick follow up. We hear that some of the most dilapidated fleets that require 20 million, 25 million per fleet to reactivate are giving that really a full refurb on all the key components that’s needed. Is there an argument to be made that pump technology has progressed to the point where it's just simply a better use of capital to build a new fleet than invest 20 million, 25 million to bring a legacy fleet back out?
Jeffrey Miller: Scott, certainly our view and that is the way why we kept our equipment the way we have, we segregated it with the end -- I described it is we stacked equipment with the end in mind so it doesn't take capital to do that. But I do believe that equipment that has not been maintained and has been cannibalized can be very difficult to get that economically back into the marketplace. 
Scott Gruber: Great. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from James West with Evercore ISI Group. You may begin.
James West: Good morning gentlemen and congratulations on a well-executed quarter. So Jeff, probably for you in terms of the North American land market and really just because of the devastation of the industry, particularly your competition, we see a lot of bottlenecks that are going to appear, labor, working capital, attrition like you discussed, the logistics. Could you maybe comment on what you see from the competitive landscape on where these bottlenecks, these pinch points might occur first or earliest and then how Halliburton can mitigate these issues relative to the competition that really can't do a lot?
Jeffrey Miller: Thank you James. Yeah, you nailed it. The pinch points will be equipment, sand and people. We spent time on equipment, but clearly the approach we've taken around equipment is to be best positioned to get that equipment back into the marketplace. So we’ve talked about that. From a sand standpoint, it's not the sand as much as it is the logistics and in our view we're very well positioned around that, having built out our infrastructure over the last several years. We've got sand delivery in every basin and we've got sufficient rail infrastructure to address the logistics part of that.  And then finally around people, we've been careful as we've gone through these restructurings to do our very best anyway to retain experienced people and we have those today. Then don't forget it was just in 2014, we put 21,000 people on to the payroll and so we know how to do that and we know how to make those people effective. So we feel like Halliburton is well positioned.
James West: Right. I totally agree. Do you think that some of the market share gains in North America have occurred because of your ability to ramp back up relative to the competition and your customer base, you understand these bottlenecks, these issues?
Jeffrey Miller: Yes I do. It’s part of the flight to quality. As I described our value proposition, it's our process people and equipment and a big part of that is the reliability of Halliburton to stay and we have stayed in all of the key markets.
James West: Got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. 
Judson Bailey: Thanks. Good morning. Dave, I was hoping to get a little more color what your thoughts on thinking about North America over the back half of the year. Oil touched 50 as you noted. It’s pulled back a little bit, closer to 45 or a little below now. How does that impact expectations in terms of activity increase the back half of the year? Is 45 enough and also is it sufficient to stabilize the pricing environment? It sounds like the pricing is still under pressure. So just like to get your thoughts on maybe the moving parts in the back half of the year as we think about oil in the mid-40s. 
A – Jeffrey Miller: Let me start that and then maybe follow up. We call it a landing point, which means rigs stop falling, but I think it's important that the – it’s a sentiment that trumps the oil price right now. Based on conversations, they are clearly more positive and constructive than they have been in the past, but realize we were starting at the worst part of the market. A lot of the worst had been factored in the plan so moving up from what were clearly the worst plans. And I would call it a measured step up as opposed to a boom. And so certainly seeing positive things we think we will be well positioned for that whatever shape that recovery takes. 
Judson Bailey: Okay. No, that's helpful. Thanks. My follow up is maybe from Mark. Mark, the margin guidance for North America up. I think you said 100, 200 basis point. That implies probably lower incremental margins than I would have thought given the cost cutting you guys are doing. Can you maybe talk a little more about the moving parts and thinking about how margins can move up in 3Q and then again in 4Q given the cost-cutting initiatives?
A – Mark McCollum: Clearly the cost -cutting initiatives are helping us, being able to get out there and address, but I think that the thing you've got key off of what Jeff was saying, that while the sentiment has changed, we’re still in a very low activity environment. Our first course of action is to get utilization on the equipment that's out there in the field and depress that quite a bit. There are because you can see it in our numbers, there’s equipment out there that's ultimately not covering fixed cost. And so we're working on trying to make sure that that equipment as we get it utilized is being as efficient as possible to move our margins up.  I think that as we work through the restructuring, that's going to continue to add margin points here on everything. I guess what we're saying is, we're not counting on price at this point. The market itself, this utilization and what we're going after, we'll fight for price every single day, but it’s still this hand to hand combat is just set out there and so we're not necessarily baking that into the forward look today. 
Judson Bailey: Okay, all right. Thanks guys. I'll turn it back. 
Operator: Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin. 
Angie Sedita: Thanks. Good morning guys. So Jeff, I also thought it was very interesting your comments there on the 900 rigs is the new 2,000. And so if you take that one step further, I guess you can conclude that that would imply in your mind that frac utilization will probably be near the last cycle peaks of 90% and then if you can take that another step forward, what would that imply on normalized margins this cycle and how you think the pricing will play out this cycle? Is it once we start to reach that 90% utilization or could we see pricing before then?
Jeffrey Miller: I think we see the state -- take the pricing first. That will follow utilization. So as we've described it in the past, we’d expect to see utilization begin to tighten and at which point you start to see pass-throughs of things and opportunities to improve margins that aren’t necessarily price. The real pricing leverage we actually didn't see in the last cycle. We were getting to that in late ’14, just about the time things slowed down. So a lot of the value creation we're able to accomplish with our platform that’s efficient and putting the utilization to it. I think the rest of that was the look forward around margin progression.  Look, I would expect very able to accomplish what we did last time, except probably do better given the fact that we've done some of the heavy lifting around structural cost. So very encouraged about how things would look in the future. 
Angie Sedita: Okay, that's helpful. So you think margins could go back to where they were last cycle given the cost cutting at a 900 rig count?
Jeffrey Miller: Yes, certainly.
Angie Sedita: Very helpful. And then on the international side, can you, whatever color you do have, thoughts on when you think we could see the bottom in some of these regions. And also it was very impressive you saw some market share gains in your international markets. Maybe you could talk about that a little bit. 
Jeffrey Miller: Yeah. So typically international business will trail US behavior by 6 to 9 months and it’s historically done that. I don't expect that it's any different. So that means that it is still an absolute brawl in the Eastern Hemisphere. The things that mute that a little bit are the length of the contract terms, which causes it to respond more slowly. And then so from a, in my view margin resilience is really reflecting better visibility that we have because of the longer timeframe and our team, the Alberta team just absolutely executing on all points. 
Angie Sedita: And then on the market share again?
Mark McCollum: Angie, let me take that one because I think it's important to understand, the Eastern Hemisphere is sort of a tale of two customer groups. You've got the NOCs generally with mature fields and they're just trying to squeeze more out of their mature fields through their existing infrastructure and that part of the business actually has held up pretty well. There’s certainly some pricing pressure there. There's certainly some issues with customers trying to lower their cost per BOE. I think it's the deep water complex that is the most challenged in this commodity price environment, and we clearly are working with our customers as are all the other contractors, to try to push that cost, that breakeven cost down in the deep water complex.  But where pricing is today, it just doesn't work generally in the deep water, especially the new deep water. So we’ve been focused on making sure that we get market share gains, even as the market has shrunk because in the long term, contracting nature of that market, when it does turn back up, you've got those contracts in hand and now market share becomes very sticky at that point in time.
Angie Sedita: Perfect. Appreciate the color and of course my best to Christian as he moves on. Thank you guys. 
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. You may begin.
Bill Herbert: Thanks. Good morning. Mark, back to the North American margin question. Just trying to understand it better. If you just focus on the quarterly rate of change and let’s just presume, you made a prophecy I think with reason that your revenues would markedly outperform the recount in the third quarter. Just presuming a 10% increase in topline and only a 200 basis point improvement in margins, that implies a 15% incremental. At this stage, that just seems to be woefully anemic, recognizing the fact that you're unemployed from an asset employment standpoint. Is there a negative pricing role that's also being taken into account in the third quarter or would you characterize the guidance as conservative?
Mark McCollum: Bill, I actually am glad you asked that question because I was sitting here thinking there was another point that I didn't get a chance to make on the earlier comment. One of the things that we're already beginning to see in the marketplace is a little bit of cost inflation. Diesel, we're seeing it in some commodities and things. And so we're already, believe it or not, at this point beginning to fight inflation. During this period of time, it’s off the bottom here with the slope of -- The shallow slope that we're on, it makes it challenging, right? We've got to get capacity utilization before you can really go get price and we're going to push, but some of the commodities are starting to poke their head up and it's catching us a little bit and that's part of what's being reflected in there. 
Bill Herbert: Okay and then Jeff, with regard to the evolution of your Q2 stage count, how would you characterize -- how did that evolve? I guess the specific question is whether the June exit rate stage count was markedly higher than the Q2 average. 
Jeffrey Miller: Yeah. We saw it was higher in June, so the exit rates were higher than so the quarter average, which is reflective of a couple of things, which is modest amount of rig activity, but also we see ducts being worked off. And I wouldn't describe ducks as the bow wave, but they are in the mix and because we're in the market the way we are, we're a beneficiary of that. 
Bill Herbert: And how would you describe the frac calendar for the second half of the year? Is it disproportionately weighted towards Q3 and pretty solid and hopeful for Q4 or pretty evenly distributed? How would you characterize your frac calendar right now? 
Jeffrey Miller: We've always got better visibility sooner than we do further out, but I would describe it as more evenly weighted at this point in time then heavier to Q3.
Bill Herbert: Okay, thanks very much guys. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. You may begin.
Sean Meakim: Hey, good morning. So just sticking on the frac business, Jeff talked about walking away from work in some cases and some of your peers have talked about requiring 20% to 30% higher pricing in order to justify reactivating frac crews. Just curious if you see it the same way. Thinking about your thoughts on what will it take for pricing to move higher and how much you need in order to bring equipment to the market? 
Jeffrey Miller: Sean, this is Jeff. Look, we're just not going to talk about pricing at this point in time. So we continue to look at every crew in terms of what's economic. And as we described before, we care a lot about customer alignment, basin alignment and customers that are able to consume our platform in a way that helps us and helps them. So we continue to view it that way. 
Sean Meakim: Okay, fair enough. And then Mark, you talked about, in previous discussions you talked about being opportunistic on some of the upcoming debt maturities. Maybe you pay down so much cash on hand, maybe in some cases you extend, so depending on what the market is giving you. Capital markets is fairly amenable today for those with even more challenged balance sheets. Just curious how you're thinking about debt reduction measures or the other potential changes to the capital structure over time.
Mark McCollum: I think our best opportunity right now is continue to look at maturities as they come due. We’ve got a $600 million maturity coming up in the back half of the year. Our current intent right now is to make that payment out of our cash flow. We should have the ability to do that. That’s a part of our cash flow forecast for the year. So that's the current intent. We're just going to continue to watch it. We’ll just continue to watch it very carefully, but we’ve got $3.1 billion dollars of cash on the balance sheet. It’s a little more than we need. With some of these maturities coming, you'll notice that we've taken the tax hits to be able to move our money around as we need it no matter where it is in the world. So right now, our current plan is just continue to naturally delever. 
Sean Meakim: Understood. Thanks for your time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin.
Timna Tanners: Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color about some of your international comments, in particular wanted to take advantage of you being the first call since Brexit to see if you have any comments on your broader thinking about what that might imply for North Sea operations. 
Jeffrey Miller: Look, we don't see Brexit alone having a dramatic effect, though clearly like in so many economies around the world, oil and gas is a clear path to help an economy. So in some ways, I think that that would be structurally a positive in the UK sector or the North Sea but immediately, no impact. 
Timna Tanners: Okay, great. And then similarly, you talked about the 6 to 9 month lag in international operations, but more challenges in Latin America. What do you think we should watch for to think about what would trigger the recovery in that region? 
Jeffrey Miller: Latin America has terrific reserves. The bottom line is the reserves are there and we've been in some countries in Latin America for 80 years. So I think that the positive signs are going to be production. It’s pleasing to see in Brazil for example, Petrobras is clearly back on the business pages today, talking about wells that are producing. But I think stability in commodity price is going to have to be one of the first things that helps in Latin America just given kind of financially where some of our customers are. But look, it is the kind of market that over time will clearly rebound.
Timna Tanners: But it’s just going to be later because of the more reliance on oil prices or what makes it so much later, or what do you think is going to be that trigger like you said?
Jeffrey Miller: I think it's later partly because you've got to almost go country by country in terms of some of the disruption that's going on. And so Mexico is working through sort of a market reorganization along with some other things that have to settle out. I believe Brazil in terms of sort of the cost of Deepwater is always an overhang and how they work through that. And then the other big one being Venezuela. Clearly a lot of turmoil there too and it’s very unfortunate, but hope to see resolution over time. 
Mark McCollum: Part of it is just the natural budgeting cycle for many of our NOC clients. Their annual budgets, they’ll have to take their budgets and get it approved by legislative bodies. They're working off a year without significant -- they're not spending and they don't have a lot of cash flow and so that means that really until those budgets are approved, they're not going to be spending and oftentimes, that ends up happening sort of later, in the late first quarter or even into the second quarter before everything's approved. And so that starts to push out the ramp in spending. Even if they see higher prices, that pushes out the ramp in spending beyond what others might see. Whereas in North America, they’re not relying on legislative bodies. They get out and they spend quickly as soon as they have the cash flow.
Timna Tanners: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much. 
Operator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin. 
David Anderson: Thanks. Dave, you talked about the psychology of the E&P getting better. I was just curious, one big part of that has to be the lower breakeven cost that they're seeing. I’ve been seeing a number of presentations from E&Ps who seem to think that the costs they have now are basically locked in place. Just curious how those discussions go. Are they expecting to see oil service inflation? Is this kind of how they're kind of locking in the next couple of years? I'm just kind of wondering what that part of the psychology of the cost side. 
David Lesar: Good question, Dave. I think the conversations go like this. Hey, we've finally driven service prices down to where we can breakeven, sort of a plus 40. My response to that is yeah, for right now, but you're not going to have any service industry to take care of you if you think that's where pricing is going to stay. And then you get into sort of a to and fro about what is sustainable. And you know Jeff hit on some of them. Rig efficiency is sustainable. That speed that we can drill out laterals is sustainable. The bigger jobs and higher production is sustainable. But that doesn't come without a cost.  And so as I said, these are a great set of customers. They know in their heart of hearts that service prices have to go up. They're going to fight that impact of prices coming up as fast and as long as they can, but the reality is they know they need a viable service industry to be successful in the long run. So it'll be give and take and my guess is as we listen to the calls over the next few quarters is, the operators will say they've got them locked in and the service companies are going to say we've got to have price increases and we'll end up in the middle somewhere like we always do. 
David Anderson: Okay. So it’s a bit of a disconnect now that kind of gets played out over the next year or 2, but there is an acknowledgement that the service cost do have to go up at some point though within -- do you think in the heart of hearts that they do acknowledge that there has to be some in there?
David Lesar:
I:
David Anderson: All right. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC. You may begin. 
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good Morning. I just wanted to calibrate, see if you guys could calibrate some information for me. So you guys talk about a 4 million horsepower reduction in the US frac market. So that puts maybe the market at about 14 million horsepower give or take. We’ve heard depending on who you want to talk to, maybe about 6 million of that horsepower is currently active in the market. That 6 million horsepower you guys talked about, a lot of whitespace, that 6 million horsepower maybe working 50% of the time. Does that kind of jibe with how you see the market right now or could you help me understand it a little bit better if you think some of those numbers are off? 
Jeffrey Miller: No man, I don’t think those numbers are inconsistent with how we view the market and that's why we described the path back is it starts with utilization of what's there. I think there are barriers to a lot of that equipment ever makes it back into the market and I do think that unintended equipment almost retreats on its own, particularly with cannibalization that we hear others talking about it. So I don't think you're wrong. 
Kurt Hallead: So then in the context as we try to think about the opportunity for margin improvement vis-à-vis pricing, do we need to get back up to 8 million horsepower now being active in the market give or take or is it sufficient to get that 6 million horsepower we all agree generally on those numbers? Can we get that 6 million horsepower up to 80% utilization and is that sufficient, just to drive some pricing? Any viewpoints on that?
David Lesar: Yeah, I think -- Let me take that one because I think -- again, we're not going to go down any pricing path today. We have a pricing strategy that we're going to follow. We're not going to share it with anybody. It’ll be sort of a discussion customer by customer, but I would say one thing is necessary. Don't fall into the trap is not all pumping equipment is the same. There are pumping companies out there that have zero utilization today because they can't find a customer or they’re in the wrong basin or their equipment is not qualified to basically set a pump to formation where they are.  So I think that there is a bifurcation, trifurcation, whatever you want to call it, amongst the pressure pumping companies. And I think a lot of people like to lump everybody together and sort of talk about averages. But I really think it's important to sort of segregate the market into the various basins, the various customers that are drilling, the types of formations that are being drilled, the kinds of completions that are getting done, before you start to get a more granular view of sort of what is really going on out there. And I think that's a view we have and I think there's a strategic advantage that we have. But I think it's important to sort of stay away from averages because I think you can actually draw the wrong conclusions about sort of the health of the industry. 
Kurt Hallead: All right, that's great color. And my follow up is on the international front. What region do you think will lead the way out and what product lines you think if frac is where you're very well positioned in the US among others to lead. Where do you think internationally Halliburton is best positioned to lead on the way out internationally? 
David Lesar: Look, I think the Middle East has demonstrated the most resilience and I think that when we think about our business, we tend to think more mature fields, unconventionals, and Deepwater. And so from a mature field standpoint, setting aside the Middle East, I think Asia probably has sort of the next chunk of runway and we're very well positioned there I'd say in all of our service lines. 
Kurt Hallead: Okay, thanks. Appreciate all that color. 
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
James Wicklund: I think that's great that you guys saved the best for last. I appreciate it. Mark, welcome back to the conference call.
Mark McCollum: Glad to be back.
James Wicklund: We look at the results and you give guidance in Q3 that margins will improve. The whole industry has had trouble keeping up with the decline in activity and now that we're starting to stabilize that gives you guys an opportunity to catch up. At what quarter, Q4, Q1 next year, at what point should we expect you to get to breakeven in North America?
Mark McCollum: I think right now just as we triangulate, Q1 of next year. I think that's where it will be.
James Wicklund: Okay. That’s great, but the way incrementals work, we never can -- We're stuck with guessing. The second thing, playing golf the other day with a couple of guys in the forgings business, which is kind of leading edge, I got a report that the largest frac pump forging order in 12 months has been issued and I'm not assuming it’s you guys, because you guys do a lot of your, most all your own work. But are we to the point in terms of sentiment and you mentioned optimism by your customers and clearly you're optimistic. Have we gotten to the point that service companies are now willing to look at increasing CapEx in anticipation of ’17? And then that really applies more to your state of mind for the future. You guys state that the recover this year will be anemic, but it will get better next year. Are we starting to free up that sentiment in terms of capital from the service side?
Jeffrey Miller: Jim, it’s interesting. Forging actually indicate more to me that they are trying to replace cannibalized parts in a lot of ways. Forging tend to be consumables as they repair equipment. One could interpret that as we've run out of cannibalized equipment and now are having to replace things. I don't see that as maybe the change in sentiment that maybe you do. But anyway …
James Wicklund: I’ll take restocking consumables. I’ll take that as the first step. 
Jeffrey Miller: Okay. Step one. 
James Wicklund: Okay guys, I appreciate it. Thanks so much. 
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. 
Jeffrey Miller: Okay, thank you, Shannon. I’d like wrap up this call with just a few key takeaways. First, we like our position. We've maintained our global integrated service footprint, outperformed during the downturn and taken share. Second, for North America the landing point is now behind us and our customers are talking about growth, not survival. And finally, we’re the best position for the recovery. We will on the last mile continue to address our cost structure and collaborate with our customers to maximize their asset value. Look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Shannon, you can close out the call. 
Operator: Ladies and gentleman, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures and unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of impairment charges and other costs. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release which can be found on our website. Now I will turn the call over to Dave.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Lance and good morning everyone. Our prepared remarks today will be brief, leaving more time for the question-and-answer period. We would like to start by providing some background on our mutual decision with Baker Hughes to terminate our merger agreement. From the time we announced the deal in November 2014, we knew that putting together two companies with the global size and scale of Halliburton and Baker would be no small task. But we believed that we could close the deal and do so in a timely manner because it truly made sense. We expected the deal would create compelling benefits for the stockholders, customers and other stakeholders of each company. The potential annual cost synergies were substantial and the transaction was expected to be accretive to cash flow and earnings within only a couple of years. In addition, the transaction would have allowed us to further reduce our customers' cost per barrel of oil equivalent. This was truly a great deal. One that was unanimously approved by each company's Board of Directors, and overwhelmingly approved by each companies' shareholders. Unfortunately, things have changed quite a bit since we signed the merger agreement. From a regulatory perspective, we completely understood that the transaction would draw regulatory scrutiny and that substantial divestitures would be required to obtain regulatory approval. However, obtaining the U.S. anti-trust approval of large complex business combinations, regardless of the industry, has become increasingly time intensive and difficult, as evidenced by the termination and litigation of several other large proposed transactions over the last 16 months. We continue to believe the proposed Baker Hughes transaction would have been pro-competitive, that our proposed divestitures were more than sufficient to address any regulatory concerns and that the position taken in the U.S. Department of Justice's lawsuit and the European Commission statement of objections, are incorrect. We also continue to believe that the transaction would be good for the industry and customers, particularly now at a time when customers are focused on lowering costs per barrel of oil equivalent. However, the DOJ's lawsuit and EC's statement of objections, combined with the elongated review process in all jurisdictions, created substantial hurdles with respect to timing and deal certainty. We would also like to correct a misimpression about the proposed divestiture package that may have resulted from the statements made during the DOJ's April press conference regarding the lawsuit. We proposed to the DOJ, a divestiture package worth billions of dollars that we believe would facilitate the entry of new competition in markets in which products and services are being divested. And we had buyers expressing a strong desire to acquire those businesses. The proposed divestitures where, for most part, divestitures of complete worldwide product lines including employees, management teams, business development personnel, manufacturing, R&D facilities, intellectual property portfolios, and customer contracts. They addressed most of the markets alleged in the DOJ complaint. We believe that the proposed divestiture package was sufficient to address the DOJ's specific competitive concerns. In addition to regulatory matters, the unprecedented deterioration of the oil and gas industry decimated the economics of the deal. During the pendency of the deal, the WTI price of oil has gone from over $76 in November of 2014 to a low of just over $26 in February of this year, while the global rig count has gone to a 17 year low and you all know what's happened in North America, where each week we seem to hit new historical lows. As a consequence, the aggregate quarterly revenues of Baker Hughes have decreased nearly 60% from $6.6 billion for fourth quarter of 2014 to $2.7 billion for first quarter of this year. Given the abrupt and deep downturn in the oil services market, we were unable to obtain adequate value for the businesses we proposed to divest. This, coupled with the decline in each company's business, eroded the expected synergies and accretive aspects of the transaction, including the timeline to integrate the businesses to levels which we believe severely undermine the originally anticipated synergy benefits of the deal. As a result, it became clear that continuing to pursue the transaction was no longer in the best interest of our stockholders, despite having to pay the termination fee to Baker Hughes. Moving forward with the transaction did not make sense in light of the elongated regulatory scrutiny, the projected timelines for closing the transaction, the poor deal economics and the current market environment. Now, to be clear, we recommended this transaction to our board and to our shareholders for approval. We believed trying to do this transaction was worth the risk because of our strong belief in our strategy, process, employees and management team, but it wasn't to be. There is no doubt we are disappointed and I want to thank both our employees, as well as the employees of Baker Hughes for their tireless efforts throughout the regulatory process. But you know what? We are Halliburton. And we will continue to provide the same innovative services and products that we've delivered to our customers for more than 97 years. We have a world-class management team, who has industry knowledge and experience to drive value for our shareholders. Prior to the potential transactions, we were in a strong number two position in the market with a proven successful strategy of gaining market share through outperforming against the rig count and having among the highest margins and returns in the industry. We were successful in executing that strategy and knew our process was scalable to a larger company. That fact has not changed. If we had been successful, adding the Baker Hughes assets would have given us that scale quickly. But our strategy has not changed, we still expect to outperform the rig count, we plan to scale up our product service line capability by addressing one product line building block at a time through internal growth, investment and selective acquisitions. Going forward, we will strive to deliver the same predictable, reliable execution and industry-leading growth, margins and returns from our world-class employees and management team. Over the past 18 months, despite our intensive efforts to close the Baker Hughes transaction, we have been executing on our key strategic areas and adapting to the new reality that we face in a very difficult market. Compared to where we were a year-and-a-half ago, we have outperformed our peers, both in North America and internationally. In the first quarter, we addressed some of our access infrastructure costs that we were carrying pending the Baker Hughes transaction. We will now move aggressively to remove the remainder of those costs from our operations over the next couple of quarters. I am very proud of the outstanding operational and customer focus our employees have kept during this entire process. Their dedication, resiliency and hard work are the foundation of our company's strength and why together we can and will weather any challenges that we face. Now let me turn the call to Christian to provide some financial details.
Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Let me start with a summary of our first quarter results. Total company revenue came in at $4.2 billion, which represents a 17% sequential decline compared to worldwide rig count decline of 21%. We experienced weakening activity levels and pricing concessions during the quarter along with seasonal weather disruptions in the North Sea and Russia. At this point, our overall decremental margins have been less than that of the previous cycle despite this downturn being deeper and longer. We've provided financial comparisons of our first quarter results to the fourth quarter of 2015 in our April 22nd press release and we would like to refer you to our commentary in that release. Due to our ongoing restructuring efforts, we've revised our financial reporting presentation to only furnish overall regional results and global division results and we will no longer provide divisional results by region. For Completion and Production and Drilling and Evaluation segments, we will only provide total global results for each segment going forward. In the first quarter, we recognized a restructuring charge of $2.1 billion after tax to further adjust our cost structure to market conditions. This charge consisted primarily of asset impairments, including most of our non-Q10 pressure pumping equipment, as well severance costs. As Dave mentioned, in the coming quarters we will continue to make further structural adjustments including the remaining escalated cost structure we've kept in North America. Further, in accordance with accounting rules, we no longer classified our assets included in the proposed divestitures as assets held for sale at the end of the first quarter. As a result, in the first quarter, we incurred an after tax charge to recognize the depreciation related to these assets that had been suspended since April of 2015. Beginning in the second quarter, our operational results will include the depreciation expense from these assets. Our corporate and other expense totaled $46 million for the first quarter excluding costs related to the Baker Hughes transaction. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the second quarter will be approximately $50 million to $55 million excluding acquisition-related costs we incurred in April and this will be the new quarterly run rate for the rest of 2016. Our first quarter free cash flow was negative $355 million driven by about $250 million of restructuring payments and acquisition -related costs. We continue to commit to living within our cash flows for the year and given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we've further reduced our capital expenditure plans for 2016 to approximately $850 million. We've been disciplined in the deployment of capital equipment during this downturn and expect to reduce our CapEx spend by approximately 75% compared to 2014. Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $346 million. For the second quarter, we expect depreciation and amortization to be about $400 billion as a result of recommencing the depreciation for the assets that were previously classified as held for sale, the impact of our multi-year reduction of capital expenditures and the impairments we have taken. In conjunction with the termination of the Baker Hughes transaction, $2.5 billion of debt that we issued in late 2015 will be mandatorily redeemed. At the end of the first quarter, we had $9.6 billion of cash and equivalents available taking into account the debt redemption plus the $3.5 billion termination fee, we would still have had approximately $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We also have $3 billion available under our revolving credit facility which with our cash balance provides us with ample liquidity of $6.6 billion to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market. For modeling purposes starting in the second quarter we will begin reflecting the incremental interest expense on the debt taking into account the redemption of $2.5 million. As such, our estimated net interest expense for the second quarter will be approximately $165 million and the quarterly run rate interest expense for the second half of 2016 will be approximately $155 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23%. Our income tax expense for the second quarter will be impacted by several factors including recognition of the incremental interest and higher depreciation, the statutory rates for the various geographies where we expect to generate income or losses, and any discrete tax items. These factors will lead to a high degree of variability on our effective tax rate. Based upon our current forecast and expected earnings mix we anticipate that we will recognize approximately $10 million to $15 million of tax expense in the second quarter. Turning to our operational outlook, the market dynamics continued to make forecasting a challenge, but let me provide you with our current thoughts on how we see the second quarter shaping up. The following regional guidance comments reflect the higher depreciation expense. In the Eastern Hemisphere, we anticipate second quarter revenues to come in at similar levels as the first quarter, but with margins lower by 300 basis points to 400 basis points due to the impact of ongoing and expected pricing concessions and additional depreciation. In Latin America, we expect an upper single digit decline in revenues with margins declining by approximately 200 basis points to 300 basis points from the first quarter levels. In North America, the U.S. land rig count is already down 23% compared to the first quarter average and has continued to deteriorate week after week. As is typical, we expect our sequential revenue decline to outperform the rig count by several hundred basis points and anticipate that our decremental margins will be approximately 25% in the second quarter. Now I'll turn the call to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Thank you Christian and good morning everyone. Before anything else, I'd like to thank each of our employees for their focus on execution in spite of the distractions presented by both the marketplace and current events. We are the execution company. As we've announced, we're sizing our cost structure to the market conditions we're experiencing. I remain confident that when the market activity stabilizes margins can start on the road to recovery. We've had a dedicated team focused on the Baker transaction which freed the rest of us from distraction and gave us the ability to aggressively pursue our corporate strategy. We've prepared the franchise to deliver industry-leading growth and returns when we exit this down cycle. Halliburton is the execution company and led our peer group in returns throughout this most recent cycle. Our strategy remains focused on what our customers value most highly. Maximizing production at the lowest cost per BOE. Clearly, this is a dynamic formula depending on where we are in the cycle. Today, there's no doubt that the numerator, meaning cost, has most of our customers' attention. Cost is something we can control and we do it well at Halliburton and I'm pleased with our progress. We've consistently delivered the strategy for two components. First, converting customer insight into cost effective solutions and second, by providing reliable service quality. Our capabilities and our execution culture are built around systematically collecting insight from our customers on their operational challenges and collaborating with them and within Halliburton to design the programs and technology to solve their economic and technical challenges. For example, during the first quarter we delivered production maximizing gravel pack chemistry for a major deepwater customer. However, instead of executing from a costly stimulation vessel, we were able to deliver the job from a substantially lower cost supply vessel by employing modular pumping equipment. The second component, executing reliably on our solutions is something Halliburton does well and our customers appreciate. Our concentration on executing key processes has realized a multiyear double-digit service quality improvement, a demonstration of our clear focus on the lowest cost per BOE in action. And finally, closing the loop on our performance is where I focus my attention every day. This is execution meaning getting things done. Are we delivering what we promised to our customers? And how do we tighten our unique fit around collaboration, technology and service quality while systematically reducing our cost and capital requirements to deliver the growth and returns we expect. This is an ongoing effort and recent example of this is our North American restructuring where we removed a layer of management. Now, this has changed our cost profile certainly but also simplified and improved our internal collaboration and execution. Commodity prices in markets will move up and down, but the one thing about which I am certain, one thing that won't change over time is that the lowest cost per BOE wins. We believe our collaborative approach to converting client insight into cost-effective solutions and our focus on reliable execution will consistently deliver the lowest cost per BOE and allow our customers to make better wells and be more successful over time. We continue to believe that the longer it takes for the recovery to occur, the sharper the recovery will be. And that North America represents the greatest upside and that Halliburton is positioned to outperform. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jeff. Let me sum things up. We are disappointed in the outcome of the Baker Hughes transaction, but we are not going to do a deal that is not economic for our shareholders and we are confident that our focused strategy will allow us to continue to outperform. Given our market outlook, we made significant changes to the fundamental cost structure of the business which, we believe, will help protect margins in the near term and drive outsize incrementals going forward. This market has generated a sense of urgency in many of our customers and we are having better conversations with them around improving their cost per barrel economics. And ultimately, we believe that when this market recovers, it will be North America that responds the fastest, offering the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be positioned to outperform. Now, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our first question comes from Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. You may begin.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you, good morning.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: A question, maybe for Jeff, maybe circle back a little bit, you touched on it in the opening comments, but the elevated cost structure you were carrying waiting for the Baker acquisition to close, could you maybe talk a little bit more and quantify that the cost cutting opportunities you see, the timing it could take to whittle that down? And I guess also, is some of that included in Christian's guidance for the second quarter margins?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Sure, Jud, thanks. Let me provide you with some color on where we are regarding cost savings. In North America, we've been carrying around 300 basis points of added costs, which we started to dismantle in Q1. Now that process is going to continue through the end of the year and we expect to eliminate 100 basis points per quarter. Now that's just in North America. So we're also looking at doing the same in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America as well as in all of our product service lines and corporate structures. So we're scrutinizing every cost, from manufacturing, to supply logistics, to field operations and we're doing this on a global basis. So, overall, we'll be reducing our structural costs by about 25% or maybe said another way, we'll lower our annual run rate on costs by around $1 billion by the end of the year, but with little of that happening in Q1. So these structural reductions are on top of volume-related cuts as we continue to adjust our operations for the market. Now, the structural changes, by definition, are stickier. And all this doesn't come without a cost. But looking ahead – we are thoughtfully looking at how we work, what makes us more effective in the way that we go to market as we make these reductions. And in many ways, we're more effective now than we were before, or at least certainly in terms of safety and service quality. So for those reasons, the changes we're making, in my view, do not impact our ability to scale in a recovery. And at the same time, positioning Halliburton to outperform through the cycle.
Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer: And, Jud, this is Christian, it is included in my guidance.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you for that, I appreciate it. And my follow up is, maybe for Dave, you mentioned it, again, in your comments, you're having discussions with customers on lowering costs, but I'm curious, with commodity prices poking their head up this quarter, are you having any more dialog from your customers on potentially going back to work in the third or fourth quarter? Or are they still taking a more cautious tone towards the back half of the year at this point?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, I think that clearly they're marginally more optimistic about things. I don't think we've seen that optimism translated into any set plans to actively increase the rigs in the back half of the year, certainly those discussions are taking place. I think if you look at our release we put out last week, we thought the rig count would bottom in Q2, I think we still believe that's the fact. But certainly, with the oil prices a little higher, people are more optimistic and we do think that potentially we'll see an upswing in the rig count in the back half of the year.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from James West with Evercore ISI. You may begin.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: Hey, good morning, guys.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hi, James.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: Hey, Dave and Jeff, maybe for you guys, so Baker is done and not going to happen and it is what it is, and you guys have seen my written comments about the DOJ overstepping their bounds here, but you still have some, I guess portfolio gaps, if you will, in production chemistry, artificial lift, how do you think about – where does Halliburton go now? What's the Halliburton of a year from now, two years from now look like?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay, let me handle that, James. I guess before we talk about what we're going to look like going forward, I think it's really important that we really review where we are today. First and foremost, we're an integrated global oil services company, and I think in order to make that claim, you have to have a broad portfolio, offer every service to every customer in every market. And if you are an integrated company, you essentially can't pick and choose where you provide, who you provide it to, where you operate and what customers you work for. If you look at our individual product lines, our current portfolio is actually pretty good. We're in a number one market position in fracturing, in cementing and completions. Our drill bits is number one in North America. Sperry, Wireline, Baroid and Landmark are all in strong number two positions. And you referenced the ones that we need some help in and certainly the Baker Hughes transaction would have helped in artificial lift and production chemicals. In those areas clearly we're not in any sort of a market-leading position, and I said that in my prepared remarks. But we have an ability to grow product lines. I think a great example of that is our testing business, where just over the last several years, we've gone from essentially a startup to almost a number two in the market position and with the contracts that we've won, we believe we'll very soon get into a number two position there. So I like where we are, we certainly have the ability, as I said in my remarks, we are going to invest in those product lines where we're a little bit weak and we'll look at selective acquisitions to round them out. I think as far as then what comes next, from a shareholder standpoint, I want to reiterate, we are continuing to be dead focused on our growth, margin and returns and leading the industry in those areas, get the billion dollars out of the business that Jeff just referenced and then take advantage of the North America rebound when it comes. So yes, we are disappointed, but we've got a good portfolio, we're going to continue to execute our strategy and we're going to be fine.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: Okay, got it thanks, Dave. And then on the North American market, it looks to us at least, and we're fairly bullish on oil prices, that cash flows for your customers will be up next year versus this year and certainly that will go back into the ground in drilling wells and could be a pretty significant recovery. As I understand, there's no translation on the current oil prices to pick up actively now, but are you starting to have conversations, Dave at your level or Jeff at your level, with your clients about their 2017 outlook? And they're going to have, in my view, they're going to have to get back after it or their production is going to go down, but are they starting to have those conversations about a pickup in activity?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, certainly as I said earlier, they're more optimistic because of where prices have gone back to. There's clearly been a re-basing, a re-setting of breakeven points through a combination of, obviously, service costs coming down, and I would argue, coming down to certainly an unsustainable level.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: Right.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: There's going to be an element of balance sheet repair that has to go forward, but clearly, that is going to be offset by what should be some pretty significant production declines that these guys are going to see. And I think given the nature of these companies and they are independents, they're very confident in their own skill set, they're confident in the acreage they have and I think that when they believe that the time is right to start drilling, they will do it. And generally, I think what we've seen is they'll be able to get the money to do that either through commodity prices, or through going back into the equity markets or the debt markets. So, yeah, they are feeling better and I think they're trying to survive to 2017 and then get on with things.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: Got it, thanks, Dave.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. You may begin.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Clearly, I'll start off by saying, clearly a year-and-a-half ago no one would've expected conditions to deteriorate so severely, so it's very good to see the market react as well as it did and see that the best move for Halliburton was actually pulling away from the deal given the current market conditions. The question I would have for you, Dave, is we'll go to the bread and butter of the U.S., on the frac side, there's a lot of discussion on the attrition side. And so therefore, I wanted to hear your thoughts, or Jeff, on how much attrition do you think is merely replacing capital goods versus true attrition of equipment that could not come back? And how old you think equipment needs to be before you see it as no longer committed, or the customers see it as no longer actually competitive? And how much of equipment out there is that?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Sure, Angie. And certainly Jeff and Jim Brown live this every day, so I'll let Jeff handle this one.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Angie, our thoughts are that about half of that equipment is idle today and that idled equipment is not being maintained. We hear companies talking publicly even about cannibalizing equipment that is stacked, and that's equipment that really doesn't go back to work. It gets rained on, it sits there, it's more and more difficult to bring back. So I think that is continuing all of the time. From our perspective – actually interestingly enough though, the volumes pump which probably has more impact on equipment continued to increase, so we saw 17% increase in sand volume on a per well basis which says that the equipment has to work harder than it ever has. And so for that reason, we are really happy with our Frac of the Future configuration in the Q10 pumps just because they handle it so well. So, again, I think the equipment is out of the market, much of that equipment is probably out to stay.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: And then do you have any thoughts on the range of horsepower that that would be?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: That's probably, we estimate in the 30% range.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Okay. And then as a follow up of our discussion here on the DUC thesis, on it potentially or maybe not tightening up the frac market. So any thoughts there on what oil prices you think we would need to see for those to start to be completed? And the timeframe and horsepower needed to complete these extra DUCs in the market?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: I think the DUCs right now are we estimate around 4,800 to 5,000, some of those are seasonal. We don't see volume continuing to build and in fact it's kind of being worked off in the stream of work that's out there today. So I don't see them as impactful, all at one time. We continue to describe them as deferred revenue for us as they get done. As far as price, I think it's more a sentiment than it is a price per se. It needs to be confidence around a price is probably as important as whatever a price may be.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: So then you don't see the completing of these DUCs as a tightening of horsepower? It's not enough to actually make a difference on or a meaningful difference on demand versus supply?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No I don't think so.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. You may begin.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So just to continue on that line of thinking a little bit, when we get to a recovery scenario, is there one in which...
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sean, can you turn – it sounds like you've got your speaker on in the background, so we're getting a double....
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Sorry about that.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Here we go. Okay.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Sorry about that. Thanks. Just on that line of thinking, in a recovery, is there a scenario in which some of your pre-Q10 horsepower goes back to work? Or do we think next cycle effectively your fleet is going to be fully Q10 irrespective of the slope of the recovery?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Our target was to be fully Q10, and I think what we continue to believe that that performance out of the Q10 is differential and so that would be a target. That said, the equipment that we have, our older equipment is still better than what's available in the marketplace. So I'm always comfortable bringing that equipment back to the extent it fills the gap. So I feel like we're very well positioned in terms of responding to the market from an equipment standpoint.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Think you. And then just on the balance sheet side, Christian, you noted the plan to continue to spend within cash flow. Following the breakup fee payment, may be an update on how you're prioritizing cash uses considering the more levered balance sheet that you are going to have?
Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer: Right. So we estimate that we need somewhere around $1 billion to run the company, so we're carrying more than enough cash, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks. Our use of cash is prioritized, first, with ensuring that we have the resources to take advantage of organic opportunities as they come. Second, the bolt-on acquisitions as well as any sort of ventures that we need to make to execute the strategy, cost per BOE strategy that Jeff laid out. And third would be any excess cash after that will be delivered back to the shareholders through buybacks.
Sean C. Meakim - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, Fair enough. Thanks for your time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.
Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thanks, guys.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Dan.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Dave, you have a very strong track record of outperforming the rig count in the U.S. in down markets and in up markets, and as we look forward here, the one thing I'd like to get an update on is, your utilization sounds very high on your frac equipment, especially the Q10 pumps, just given what you are experiencing in your completion revenue in U.S. versus what peers are reporting. So in order for you to continue to outperform as the rig count increases, is that going to need to come from price increases? Or do you expect to get further market share gains and on the further market share gains, is that going to require potentially unstacking some of the equipment that you recently impaired?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think. Dan, it's actually a good question, it's one we talk about a lot internally. I think you have to go back to the basic strategy that we follow in North America and that is to be in every basin, to be with the right customers in those basins and have the right relationships with those customers. So there's a number of ways to outperform the rig count when it comes back. And obviously, I won't give a detailed roadmap as to how you do that but, certainly, by being and having the right customers as your bread and butter from a revenue stream, they generally are the ones that are more financially secure. They have the better acreage, and they are the best positioned. They are likely the ones to put the earliest rigs up. And therefore, it's a natural extension of your market share by you take a customer that we have a great relationship, might be running five rigs today when they go to eight rigs, you automatically get that work. So that's one way. Second is the efficiency of our equipment. When things bounce back and it will, lowest cost per BOE and efficiency is still going to be very, very important. And having the Q10, having our Frac of the Future, having our footprint, having our logistical system and all of those things in place because we have not and will not dismantle any of that, as part of the exercise Jeff talked about, will still allow us to be the low-cost provider in a market that's expanding. I think another reason that we have worked hard to keep our utilization up is, it is I don't care what people say, it is going to be harder to crew frac spreads, it's going to be harder to crew cementing equipment and those sorts of things when this thing turns back. And so by keeping and preserving as much of our workforce and as much of our equipment being active, we can basically leverage that workforce more quickly across an expanding rig count. So I like where we are, it hasn't come without, obviously, a cost. We've worked hard with our customers to make sure that they in a position to keep rigs in the air. That's not, as I said, come without a cost on our margins, but I think it's a good trade-off because when this thing snaps back it's going to snap back hard and I really like the position we're going to be in at that point in time.
Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And somewhat related, when I look at your CapEx, it's coming down quite a bit this year and it's really running about mid-single-digits at least of my revenue estimate and that's down from low-double-digits in the past. As the cycle snaps back, as you say and we start to get in that recovery mode, will CapEx get back to that level of near double-digit or are we at a structurally lower level?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, I think at least in the near term we're probably at a structurally lower level. If you look at our release that we put out a week ago, clearly the whole industry is overcapitalized at this point in time, and it's overcapitalized with some really good equipment. So I think that as it flexes back and the rig count comes up, customer start to spend more money, the need to spend on capital, if in fact you are maintaining your equipment, maintaining your tools, which is what we are doing. We're not cold stacking stuff and letting it deteriorate, it's really just going to be an issue of getting the people to man that equipment as it comes back. So I don't really see us getting back to that level unless the market got really frothy like it did last time. Hey, that would be a great position to be in, I just don't see it at this point though.
Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks for the time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim. You may begin.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Mike.
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thanks, guys. A lot of questions on the operation side have been answered. I wanted to just ask a quick one on capital structure. You talked about, Christian, the priorities of use of cash, but how do you think about the mix of debt versus equity right now and into the next couple, three years?
Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer: So one of the metrics that we use, Mike, is the way we look at our leverage is through – is the ratio of net debt to net cap, and we expect that ratio which is about 30% to go into the mid-40%s, so it is still very manageable. But you're right, we have to look at ways to delever the balance sheet and we're putting on plans to do that. Now having said that, Mike, and you know this, we are an investment-grade company and even though much like the rest of the industry, we are being reviewed by the credit rating agencies, we fully expect that after the smoke clears that we will remain an investment-grade company. So we will have ample liquidity and the financial flexibility to do whatever we need to do to make sure that we continue to add value to our stakeholders.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think, Mike, this is Dave, we'll have an obvious quick decision or quick opportunity to assess things. We have a $600 million debt repayment due in the fall and whether we just pay that off with the excess liquidity we have or look at the total capital structure, that's something that we'll be doing over the summer and into the fall. As Christian said in the call, even after the dust settles, we're going to have over $3.5 billion of cash sitting on the balance sheet. That is actually too much given where we are in the cycle and the fact that it costs us about $1 billion to sort of run the company. So we actually have that problem sitting in front of us right now, great problem to have. And we'll spend the balance of the second quarter here watching the market. There could be additional acquisition opportunities come up. As Christian said, we would consider buybacks, and any of the whole range of options. So we're in a good position to just sit back right now, make that decision, but clearly capital structure is on the top of our priority list right now
Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Great. Thanks so much guys.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from James Wicklund with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning, guys.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, James.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): By everybody's agreement, North America is going to come back first. In the international sector, I'm just kind of curious how you guys see how long it takes for international to come back, and which markets to come back first?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Thanks, Jim. The international cycles are just longer, and so they are longer on the way down because structurally the contracts are longer, they're also slower on the uptick as well. So, I don't expect to see improvement internationally until we see some improvement in North America. That timeframe has usually been six months to a year in terms of the lag between North America and the rest of the world. I think if we look around the world though, the...
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hang on, hang on – hey, Jim, just like a couple guys ago, you've got your speaker on in the background, so we're getting an echo I suspect everybody is too.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. I will try and fix that. Thank you.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Internationally, it does not have the same overcapitalization that we saw in the U.S., so I think that that will help it react more quickly. As far as markets returning, I think the mature fields part of the business is the first to tighten back up, would start with the better markets like Middle East would be – it's most resilient but it tightens first. Probably we'd think Asia would be next as we looked around.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. I appreciate that. And my follow-up if I could, Jeff, you talked a lot about the cost per BOE, and then, Christian, you talked about bolt on acquisitions and possible costs related to Jeff's cost per BOE strategy. What are the capital requirements for the implementation or continuation, Jeff, of your cost per BOE strategy and what products was the capital actually spent on?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Well, capital is spent on the things that drive a lower cost per BOE, and by that I don't mean to be trite, but there are technologies, there are pieces of the business that, in my view, contribute to that. How we work and how we integrate internally is a big part of how we put those things to work. So there will be gaps here and there that say, hey, if we can put that to work in our system to drive a differentially lower cost per BOE, those are the things we want to spend money on. From an equipment perspective, Q10 is a great example of that. Because it differentially drives a lower cost for us and a lower cost per BOE for the market. So I think you'll see us consistently evaluate things through that lens.
James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rob MacKenzie with IBERIA Capital. You may begin.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC: Thank you, guys. I had a question, followed up on Baker's call and tying it into what you guys said about this morning, Dave, about weakness, obviously, in artificial lift and production chemicals. Can you foresee a return to Baker perhaps selling those product lines through Halliburton in an integrated type offering?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I'm not going to speculate on that.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC: Okay. Well, that was my question, thank you. I will turn it back.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Believe me, I've got lawyers shaking their heads at me like crazy right now.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC: Okay. Well, then – I guess, my follow-up then would be, how do you see based on Baker's, if you can comment, based on Baker's strategy change, how do you see the competitive dynamic changing in a lot of particularly international markets but also in the U.S., say, pressure pumping market where they seem to be pulling back largely from that business?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I think let me just stipulate, I did not listen to Baker's call this morning, so I really don't know what they said. So I can just sort of respond to what we see in the marketplace. I think that pressure pumping, in my view, to be successful at it in the U.S. you have to have the U.S. wide business because so much of the advantage you get in that business is through scope and scale. It's being the biggest procurer of sand, it's having the infrastructure, it's having the rail cars, it's having the transload centers, it's having the ability to spend on technology, on chemistry, on footprint, on downhole capabilities. And I think pulling back into a limited number of basins just doesn't allow you to have that scope and scale. So our strategy has always been one that you have to be, if you're committed to being an integrated services company, you have to take the benefit and the downside of that. And in a market like this, there is some downside because you are operating in some markets, you are operating in some product lines that maybe are not giving you the kinds of returns that you want. But at the end of the day when it does bounce back and you're making hay from a margin standpoint, it's way better to be essentially in every basin with every product line, so that's our strategy. As I said, I don't know what was said this morning, but our strategy is to be a full-service company, integrated across our product lines in every place that our customers want us to work.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. You may begin.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Hey, Dave.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. Just following on the same line of thinking, bundling of services was a big subject of last few years before the downturn, I'm wondering if anything has changed in your philosophy in North America. Obviously the low-cost operator you talked about, the vertical integration; nobody is going to be more efficient than you guys. Is that still the thought that we're going to lead with the pressure pumping, that efficiency is pulling the rest of this technology and that's where margins come from in North America? Has anything changed with this downturn in that line of thinking?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. In fact, I think bundling and the ability to bundle, will be even more important as we come out of this for one simple reason. This thing finally got so bad that our customers had to lay people off, and by basically reducing their G&G capabilities, their engineering capabilities, their exploration capabilities, their drilling departments, they don't have those people internally that maybe were basically not as interested in bundling as they may have been in the last go around. So as this thing turns back up, they are going to be also more stressed from a people standpoint, and the conversations we're having with them today is about the advantages of bundling, from not only an efficiency standpoint, but from a cost standpoint.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So if we just think about your Q10 pumps, obviously you're talking about kind of hydrating your all equipment with all the Q10s. Can you help us understand a little bit on that fleet? I'm not sure how you measure the bundling. I think in the past you've talked about maybe two or three product lines that are pulling through. Can you give us sort of, I don't know, a measurement of where we stand right now on that?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Look, the Q10 is a key component of how we go to market, it drives our cost down most certainly. So we see just more things bundled around the wellhead. There is not as clear a measure around that. I think, it's more we bundle to the degree it drives lower cost for BOE for our clients, and those things become clearer as the activities around the completion start to pile up. And that's clearly an advantage for us because the equipment works together, or people work together and ultimately it does deliver a lower cost per BOE.
J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Marshall Adkins with Raymond James. You may begin.
J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, guys. A quick question on the asset impairments. How many pressure pumping horsepower was that that was impaired?
Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer: We're not going to provide that level of detail, Marshall, but just to give you a flavor of the restructuring. Of that, C&P was two-thirds of that amount and one-third is D&E. That's probably what the level of detail that we're going to provide.
J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Right. It helps. And what happens to that horsepower once it's written down? Is it just scrapped or what do you see happen there?
Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President of Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer: Well, the way we've impaired the assets, there's really two buckets. One that is actually written off and therefore we're going to get rid of it. And then there's a portion of the assets that actually are idled, cold-stacked and we did an impairment analysis on that amount. Those are the larger components of our restructuring charge around fixed asset impairments.
J. Marshall Adkins - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. One last just quick one on labor. You all mentioned labor issues, and recrewing these crews. Could you give us a little more color on that because I've been hearing the same thing from different industry sectors. And where do you see the limitations on labor as we ramp back up over the next couple of years?
Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: This is Jeff, I think we're differentially advantaged there, just because as Dave mentioned, we stay in the market and we keep experienced people, and know how to hire those kinds of people. If we look back just to 2014, we hired 21,000 people at Halliburton during that year, absolute adds. So we do know how to add people to the payroll when we need to. So those people are out there, it's not easy to recruit them, but we certainly know how to recruit them and I think we've demonstrated our ability to do that.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Jeffrey Allen Miller - President & Director: Okay. Thanks, Shannon. So I'd like to wrap the call up with just a couple of comments. So first, while we are disappointed about the outcome of the Baker Hughes transaction, we are excited about the future and our differentiated strategy to maximize production at the lowest cost per BOE for our clients. We are having productive conversation with clients around how we do this in the current marketplace. Second, we are systematically removing structural costs to address the current market outlook while retaining our ability to rebound quickly when activity turns up. We remain dead focused on revenue growth margins and returns, and clearly believe that Halliburton will be best positioned to outperform when the market recovers. So thank you, I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Shannon, you can end the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood, Halliburton's Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. 
Kelly Youngblood: Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2015 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. During our prepared remarks, Dave will provide an update on the pending Baker Hughes transaction. However, due to the ongoing regulatory review we will not be taking any questions today related to regulatory matters. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures and unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter press release, which can be found on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. I want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2015. First, total company revenue of $23.6 billion declined 28% year-over-year, outperforming a 35% decline in both the average worldwide rig count and global drilling and completion spend. And even though it was a very tough market, I am pleased to say that once again, we outpaced our peer group in North America and internationally both sequentially and on a full-year basis. I am especially pleased with the resilience of our international business, despite lower revenues as a result of pricing concessions and activity reductions, we were able to improve operating margins during the year due to a relentless focus on cost management. We also outperformed our largest peers sequentially and on a full year basis in both revenue and in margins. And in North America, of course, it was beyond a challenging year where we saw unprecedented declines in activity. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance. From the 2014 peak, our completions-related activity declined approximately 33% relative to a 64% reduction in the US land rig count. This clearly again demonstrates the customer flight to quality that has emerged during this downturn and positions us well for the market's eventual recovery. Now I would like to provide you with an update on the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. During the quarter, we announced that our timing agreement with the Department of Justice expired without reaching a settlement or the DoJ initiating litigation. In December, the DoJ informed us that they do not believe that our previously announced proposed divestitures are sufficient to address the DoJ's concerns, but acknowledged that they would assess further proposals. With respect to the European Commission, the review has entered phase 2, which was anticipated and we recently advised the commission that we plan to formally propose remedies which we believe should satisfy any competition concerns. Earlier this month, Halliburton presented to the DoJ an enhanced set of proposed divestitures in order to seek their approval of the transaction. We also informally notified the EC and other jurisdictions about the enhanced divestiture package. The sales process for the planned divestiture continues and we are in discussions with interested buyers. There is no agreement to date with the DoJ or EC as to the adequacy of the proposed divestitures. Our conversations with the DoJ and the EC and other enforcement authorities continue with the desire to resolve their competition-related concerns as soon as possible. Now I want to be clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal through despite the extended time required to obtain regulatory approvals. Now while it is taking longer than originally expected, we believe the compelling strategic and financial benefits for our shareholders inherent in this combination continues to remain intact. We strongly believe that the proposed merger is good for the industry and for our customers. The combination is expected to create an even stronger company and achieve substantial efficiencies, enabling us to compete aggressively to provide efficient, innovative and low-cost services. Completion of the transaction would allow us to better meet our customers oil services needs and help them operate more cost effectively, which is increasingly important due to the current state of the energy industry and oil and gas prices. Finally, we agreed with Baker Hughes to extend the period to obtain required regulatory approvals to no later than April 30, 2016, but remain focused on completing the deal as early as possible. In the event regulatory approvals have not been received by April 30, the merger agreement does not terminate automatically. Both companies may continue to seek regulatory approval or either company may terminate the merger agreement. Now, let me discuss what we're seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year, and then Christian will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail. Now this has certainly been the most challenging downturn that I've seen in my many, many years in business. We expect the market will continue to remain challenged in 2016 and that it will be the first time since the late '80s that global upstream spending will decline for two consecutive years. Commodity prices have been a moving target, forcing our customers to be cautious in providing visibility to us and their shareholders into their 2016 capital expenditure plans. Although we do not believe current oil prices are sustainable, they are without a doubt negatively influencing customer plans in the near term. On a geographic basis, North America is expected to be the most impacted in 2016. Third party surveys have also been a moving target, indicating a year-on-year decline in service spending from 30% up to as much as 50% and that's on top of the estimated 40% decline in industry spend in 2015. But the reality is, due to the macro uncertainties, many of our customers are managing their businesses in real time, rig-by-rig. Accordingly, we are going to take this market week-by-week and in some cases crew-by-crew. This is unlikely to change until our customers have confidence in a sustainable and economical oil price. Now there are a number of moving parts in North America and my experience has taught me not to bet on the exact timing of a recovery. But we do expect that the longer it takes, the sharper the recovery will be. Until then, we will continue to execute our playbook and adapt our cost structure to market conditions, while also positioning our North America land business for future success and ultimately to outperform the industry as the market recovers. The international markets held up much better than North America in 2015, but they are also not immune to the impacts of lower commodity prices. Recent third party surveys for international spend indicate a decline that may be up to 20%, which will be slightly worse than last year. We're working diligently with our customers to improve economics of their projects through technology and operating efficiency, but do expect margins to be negatively impacted by lower activity levels and pricing pressures throughout the year. Now looking at our geographies, we expect activity in the Middle East, Asia region to again be the most resilient in 2016 as recent mature field project awards throughout the Middle East are anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Australia, India and other markets across Asia to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects. Europe/Africa/CIS is also expected to experience activity declines across the entire region in 2016 with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea and Angola where the offshore markets continue to face extremely challenging economics. Customers are focused on reducing their cost structures through more efficient well design and the adoption of new standards for production systems. But these are structural changes that will take time to fully implement. And in Latin America, we expect lower activities across the region with the largest declines projected in Brazil and Mexico as a result of significant NOC budget constraints. Latin America is currently expected to have the largest percentage decline within our international markets. So in summary, 2016 is simply going to be a tough slog through the mud, but I can tell you we'll do what we have to do. We know what buttons to push and levers to pull and we will. We believe our customers will remain focused on cost per barrel optimization and gaining higher levels of efficiency, both of which bode very well for Halliburton. Now it is very difficult to predict the exact timing, but once the market has visibility of the trough the recovery will come into view and when it does, we expect the recovery will play out very similar to others where North America will rebound first and the strongest, followed by the international markets where the rebound will be more methodical. Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?
Christian Garcia: Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our fourth quarter results to the third quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.1 billion represented a 9% decline, while operating income declined by 7% to $473 million. All regions experienced revenue declines during the quarter led by North America as a result of continued activity and pricing headwinds. For our international business, fourth quarter revenue and operating income declined by 5% and 10% respectively as a result of price concessions and activity declines with our customers during the quarter. Additionally, due to customer budget constraints, we did not see the typical benefit from year end equipment and software sales. In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue declined by 5% with a similar decline in operating income of 6%. Lower activity levels in Saudi Arabia and Iraq led the decline, partially offset by modestly higher sales in China and increased activity in Kuwait and Oman. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, we saw the fourth quarter revenue decline by 6% with a decrease in operating income of 18%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by a sharp reduction of activity in the North Sea, partially offset by higher activity in Angola and Algeria. Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 6% and 9% respectively driven by reduced activity throughout most of the region, partially offsetting this decline was improved activity levels in Mexico. Moving to North America, revenue declined 13% with operating margins improving by approximately 160 basis points. Reduced activity throughout the US land was the primary driver of the revenue decline, especially in the pumping-related product lines. The margin improvement was primarily due to a spike in year end completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, which is not expected to repeat in the first quarter. Margins also benefited from our aggressive cost-reduction efforts and minimal weather disruptions during the quarter. Our margins continue to include an elevated cost structure in North America in anticipation of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. For 2015, our total company decrementals were about half of the previous cycle due to actions we've been taking to adjust our cost structure throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge of $192 million after tax consisting primarily of asset write-offs and severance-related costs. As industry fundamentals continue to weaken, we will continue to make further structural adjustments and may incur additional charges in the first quarter. Our corporate and other expense totaled $70 million for the quarter, excluding costs related to the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $70 million, excluding acquisition-related costs and this will be the new run rate for 2016. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of approximately 19% includes a retroactive benefit from Congress's recent approval of the Federal Research and Experimentation Tax Credit. As we go forward in 2016, we are expecting the first quarter and full year effective tax rates to be approximately 24% to 25%. Given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we further reduced our capital expenditures as we exited the year, ending 2015 with a total CapEx spend of $2.2 billion. Our current guidance for 2016 capital expenditures is $1.6 billion. This CapEx guidance includes the continued conversion of our fleet to Q10 pumps to support our service efficiency strategy, which is critical in this environment. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion for 2016. This is the first time in over a decade that our CapEx is lower than our expected DD&A expense, which demonstrates our commitment to live within our cash flows during this challenging period for the industry. Turning to our operational outlook, the severity of the activity decline in the coming year continues to be unclear, but let me give you some comments for the first quarter. Our first quarter international results will be subject to weather-related seasonality that occurs in geographies such as the North Sea and Russia, exacerbated by the uncertainty around customer spending levels for the coming year. Although difficult to predict at this point, we anticipate first quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenues to decline sequentially by a low double-digit percentage with margins similar to the first quarter of 2015 levels. In Latin America, we anticipate revenues to decline sequentially by a mid-teens percentage with margins retreating to the upper single digits. In North America, we also have limited visibility, but estimate that first quarter revenues will decline with the US rig count, which is already down double digits against the fourth-quarter average. We currently anticipate margins to come in at around breakeven levels. And finally, we enter 2016 on a solid financial position with strong liquidity, which will enable us to address the current market challenges and be well positioned for the industry's eventual recovery. Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Christian and good morning, everyone. To begin, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate all of our front line people for delivering solid fourth quarter results in a tough market. As Dave mentioned earlier, we're expecting 2016 to be a very challenging year due to poor commodity prices and shrinking customer budgets. We believe that as the coming cycle unfolds, we'll see a continuation of what began in 2015, customers seeking efficiency gains and discrete technology to help them bend the cost curve. At lower commodity price levels, we believe the market will continue to evolve in this direction and customers will adopt products and services that help them produce wells with a lower cost per barrel of oil equivalent. Now this plays directly into Halliburton's strengths, helping our customers become more efficient on location can maximize their production, all of which contribute to lowering their unit cost per barrel of oil. So regardless of the commodity price, we're continuing to execute on our proven two pronged strategy in this downturn. The first part being to control what we can control in the short term and second is to look beyond the cycle to prepare for recovery. And with respect to the short term, this means making the tactical changes necessary to right size the business to the market. We revisited our cost profile throughout 2015 and made significant changes to help mitigate the impact on our operating margins and we'll continue to do so. It started with where we were. We systematically reviewed profitability at a granular, sub product line level. This resulted in the consolidation of facilities in more than 20 countries around the world and closing down operations in two countries. And finally, current market conditions forced us to reduce global headcount by 25% in 2015, a necessary but very unfortunate reality. The second part of our strategy is to look beyond the cycle and ensure the long-term health of the franchise. For example, aligning ourselves with the right customers, investing in technology and staying dead focused on superior execution. In terms of customer portfolio, we work to align ourselves with customers that have stronger balance sheets and fairway acreage in the basins. In North America, our top 17 customers make up 50% of our revenue. When the downturn began, these customers were among the last to lay down rigs. Today, we're collaborating with them on ways to lower their cost per BOE to a place where we can both be successful, and when the recovery comes, we believe that these operators and therefore Halliburton will be best positioned for the upside. In terms of technology, 2015 was a successful year, despite the downturn in activity, we saw an uptake of new technologies such as DecisionSpace and RockPerm helping customers maximize production and lower their cost per barrel of oil. A recent addition to our custom chemistry portfolio is our MicroScout service. MicroScout is a hydraulic fracturing treatment designed to deliver proppant into far field micro fractures enhancing the productive life of new wells. Early trials have indicated more than a 20% uplift in production compared to offset wells. Now technologies like MicroScout represent years of research through a disciplined, multistage, gate program and although I typically spend more time talking about execution and how we get things done in the field, it's important to point out that we're executing in the technology side of our business as well. Through joint reach projects with our customers and by elevating field developed solutions, Halliburton is among the more efficient innovators in any industry. Last year, Halliburton secured new patents at an R&D cost of less than $1 million per patent. In terms of R&D patent efficiency, which is central to the return on intellectual property, Halliburton is in the same range as other top global US patent leaders. And finally, superior execution. Service quality is a frequently underappreciated piece of our business, but I can tell you that in a market like this a timely efficient job can be the difference between an economic well and an uneconomic well. So for many markets, contract extensions and project awards are influenced by service quality or simply put, it's how we distinguish ourselves to win and retain the work. Now looking at 2015, it was an extremely strong year for the quality of our operations. This was our third straight year of improvement in both safety and service quality metrics, both of which saw significant double-digit reductions from 2014. Even while the market is forcing us to streamline our footprint in the field, we're improving our performance rates, essentially doing more with less and doing it better. We're refining our processes and systems, eliminating everything that's not required to deliver our value proposition. You'll be hearing more about this throughout 2016 as this is not a one time event. It's the relentless focus on efficiency and process improvement that makes us the execution company. We believe that these elements, our strong customer portfolio, our efficient technology spend and our superior service quality provide a strong foundation for our business. We are confident that by executing on our strategy and building on the successes, we can continue to outperform our competitors both during the downturn and when the recovery comes. Now let me turn the call back to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?
Dave Lesar: Thanks, Jeff. Let me sum it up. As I said, 2016 is shaping up to be one tough slog through the mud and the industry is going to have to take it a quarter at a time. We have a seasoned management team and a proven playbook that has served us well during previous cycles and we're entering the year from a position of strength with a solid financial position. We are focused on maintaining a strong customer portfolio, investing in more efficient technology and delivering reliable, best-in-class service quality for our customers and are preparing the business for growth when the industry recovers. And as we demonstrated this year whatever the market gives us we will take it and then take some more. And finally, we remain fully committed to closing the pending acquisition of Baker Hughes. We are diligently focused on the regulatory reviews, the divestiture process and planning for integration activities after we close the deal. So with that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from James West from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good morning, guys.
Dave Lesar: Morning, James.
James West: So Jeff, really impressed with the international operations in 2015, I mean, growing margins, outperforming on the revenue decline. Obviously, there's a lot of cost management going on there. Could you maybe highlight a little bit further how you guys were able to outperform and what '16 looks like in terms of your ability to continue to outperform?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Well, thank you, James. It really is around aggressive cost control. And we've been outperforming for a number of quarters. This looks like winning the right contracts and managing the heck out of the costs most certainly and it's also a mature field strategy in action. I mean, a big piece of this is mature fields and where we see the benefit of scope, scale and that clarity of strategy, it's a recipe for success. So really pleased with the performance and that team is right on top of their business.
James West: And you think that out performance could continue as we go through '16?
Jeff Miller: Yes. So if we look at '16, I mean, it will be a tougher slog in '16, no question. I mean, we're seeing fairly constant pressure around negotiation and tenders. But, in some cases, we are having what I would say positive collaborative discussions with clients around how to reduce uncertainty, increase system efficiency. So certainly pleased with our performance right now.
James West: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Jud Bailey: Thanks. Good morning. Follow up question on some of the international commentary earlier, specifically Latin America. I think there was a sequential revenue decline somewhere in the mid-teens. Christian or Dave, could you maybe give us a little bit of color, is that based on activity declines, is it pricing, both or do you have any other major projects that may be rolling off? Just maybe a little more commentary over what's driving Latin America at least in the first quarter?
Christian Garcia: So in Latin America, if you look at our sequential declines, it was 6%, down 6%. It was driven by almost all countries except for Mexico. Now on a product line by product line basis, we had actually good Landmark and Baroid. However, we also had some expenses associated with our vessels in Mexico.
Dave Lesar: Maybe one further comment. I mean, across the piece it's a tough slog in Latin America. Nearly every country is facing some sort of particular challenge, whether it's macroeconomic or just pure facing down commodity price, which is an example for a Colombia for example. So we're seeing historical lows in terms of rig activity in a couple of countries and I don't see that changing.
Jud Bailey: Okay. I guess I was more referencing the first quarter, some of the commentary. I think - didn't you say, Christian, mid-teens sequential decline for revenue?
Christian Garcia: Yes, that is absolutely correct. And it's because of the macro headwinds that Latin America is facing. As Dave pointed out, Latin America will probably be the most challenged international region that we have and it's particularly acute in Mexico and Brazil.
Jud Bailey: Okay. All right. And my follow-up, Dave, maybe if you could maybe talk a little more about North America and I guess specifically the nature of discussions with customers and maybe how those are evolving with commodity prices to start the year. They are obviously going through a number of different budget initiatives. Maybe you could talk a little bit about any visibility that you have or don't have and kind of what customers are communicating and how they are thinking about the first half of 2016 in North America?
Dave Lesar: Yes, I mean, I'm talking almost every day with the CEOs of our customers and I would say that it's a real challenge out there. And I guess the way I would sum it up is there is sort of a constant revision of budgets going on and those revisions are clearly with a downward bias. So the way I would describe it is, right now, our customers don't know what they are going to spend, where they are going to spend it and when they are going to spend it in North America at this point in time, which is why I made the comment earlier we really are trying to run the business on literally a week-by-week, crew-by-crew, unit-by-unit basis until our customers see some stability in pricing where they can then put a stake in the ground. But until they can put that stake in the ground, we're just going to have to remain very flexible and I like our chances in that kind of a market.
Jud Bailey: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: Thanks. Good morning, guys and certainly I echo James comments on a very impressive quarter and year given overall market conditions.
Dave Lesar: Thank you.
Christian Garcia: Thank you.
Angie Sedita: So a little bit of granularity on the US pressure pumping market. In the past, you've done some work on the potential level of attrition, specifically for pumps and engines versus fluid ends, so any color further on the attrition side? And are you starting to see a change of behavior by the small pressure pumpers where they are starting to become more aggressive in either pulling out of the market or on the cost side or can they?
Jeff Miller: Angie, this is Jeff. Attrition is really the story here and consistent with remarks before, we see today about half the equipment is idled. That's equipment that's not being maintained and is being cannibalized for parts more broadly. The service intensity, believe it or not, continues to creep up. So we saw a 9% sequential increase in profit pumped on a per well basis, which means equipment is working harder than it ever has. We estimate 4 million to 6 million horsepower that will be out of the market by the second half of 2016. My gut says we're at the top end of that range right now. And this is really why we're committed to Frac of the Future. I mean, it's the cost of the pump and it's the total operating cost of the equipment that matters in my view the most and that's what will have Halliburton best positioned for the recovery.
Angie Sedita: Okay, very, very helpful. And then any change in behavior with the small guys given where their margins are and overall profitability or status quo with what you saw in the second half of '15?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean, we don't see ourselves as competing with that group, but they are certainly aggressive in the marketplace. We haven't seen them back off. But, again, this is the reason why we have strategically invested in Frac of the Future and surface efficiency and then the custom chemistry that we deliver. I talked about some of that in my earlier comments, I mean, those are the things that differentiate Halliburton.
Angie Sedita: Okay. Perfect. And then as an unrelated follow-up, on the merger, obviously, you can't talk about the regulatory process, but, Dave and Mark, you've commented in the past that you've reiterated your confidence on the cost synergies with Baker cutting pretty aggressively as well on the cost side. Can you talk about the cost synergies, your confidence there into 2016, '17?
Dave Lesar: Angie, I don't want to elaborate anymore, but the cost synergy story stays intact.
Angie Sedita: Okay, perfect. Thanks. I'll turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dave Anderson from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Dave Anderson: Great. Thank you. So you mentioned several mature field projects in the Middle East, I think, you said are poised to move ahead. How do you think the Baker Hughes transaction is having an impact on bidding of this type of work? I guess I'm just kind of wondering, with the uncertainty around the divestitures it must make it a bit challenging for both you and your customers in terms of putting together and evaluating bids. Can you just talk a little bit about how this is being handled?
Dave Lesar: Yes. Dave, as you can appreciate, I don't think we want to go there.
Dave Anderson: Okay.
Dave Lesar: They still compete with us. We're still running our companies separately and they are in the market making their own pricing decisions and where they tender and how they tender and we don't have any visibility into that.
Dave Anderson: Okay. On a separate subject on North America, on your North American margins, I noticed the D&E margins in North America improved quite a bit this quarter. C&P was more or less as expected. I think you said in the release it was something to do with offshore. Can you expand a bit, obviously, it wasn't the completion sales. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on? Is that a trend we should be expecting and maybe kind of your outlook on how you are seeing the Gulf of Mexico this year?
Christian Garcia: So on your question around D&E, D&E was also benefited from obviously aggressive cost reductions, as well as Baroid and Landmark had good quarters. In terms of just the overall completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, as we pointed out in the prepared remarks, we don't expect that to repeat in the first quarter.
Dave Anderson: Okay.
Jeff Miller: I think it's important, let me just follow that up because our D&E business is executing really well. I mean, those guys are dead focused on winning the right contracts. We're seeing the benefit of a lot of work in key markets for all of our D&E service lines.
Dave Anderson: Do you think you can keep those margins where they are over the next couple quarters in D&E?
Christian Garcia: Well, we're taking it one quarter at a time and we'll just have to see.
Dave Anderson: Fair enough. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: Thanks. Good morning. Dave, with regard to your cost structure, I mean, you extolled an exceedingly realistic outlook for 2016, international down as much as 20% and North America down anywhere from 30% to 50%. And given the adjustments that you've made over the preceding two quarters, are you right sized for this expected level of activity in 2016 now?
Jeff Miller: Yes, Bill, this Jeff. I mean, we are always reducing costs and so as Dave described, it is a moving target. But there are still a number of areas where we continue to work on reducing costs, both at the variable cost, as well as around some of those sustainable fixed cost items like refining our maintenance processes takes out cost, value engineering exercises that are taking place. We, in one case took more than 20% of the cost out of 20 products. So we're constantly, as I say, reviewing the structure. But I do believe these are things that best position Halliburton for the recovery.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And two housekeeping items for me to sort of end it, magnitude [ph] to Gulf of Mexico year end completion tool sales and then also depreciation, why is it going up when your capital spending is going down by as much as it is in 2016?
Christian Garcia: Well, it was because of additional CapEx, right. So obviously, there is a layering effect on the CapEx. On your first question, what was the first question again, Bill, on the completion?
Bill Herbert: Gulf of Mexico year-end sales, what was magnitude [ph]
Christian Garcia: We're not going to provide that sort of detail. As I pointed out in the prepared remarks, the margin increase in North America has been due to both the completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico and also the impact of cost reductions that we did at the end of the third quarter. To give you just a little bit of additional color, the sequential decrementals for the US land in the fourth quarter was in the very low single digits. So as you can see, there has been a significant contribution from the cost cuts that we did in the third quarter.
Bill Herbert: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Good morning.
Dave Lesar: Morning.
Christian Garcia: Good morning.
Scott Gruber: I want to circle back to the international margin risk as this is very top of mind for investors currently. Obviously, your margins have proven very resilient, so kudos to you and your team. But this does lead some investors to believe that your clients abroad will simply continue to ask for larger and larger concessions until you're down to very thin margins. Can you just comment conceptually on why this risk is low to help allay these fears in the marketplace?
Jeff Miller: I think the investment internationally, at least by Halliburton, we were always sizing largely to the market that we saw. It's a little bit different than maybe what we saw in North America. And so I think that our ability to pull levers internationally in key markets is probably more focused. The - and again, I think the ability to size as we move along will bode well for us.
Dave Lesar: Yes, I think, let me just add a little color to that. Of course the way you do business between international markets and the US market is also quite different. With the drilling and completion efficiencies that we've gotten in the US, the time to drill and complete a well has been dramatically reduced, which means the time between when you can price what does a frac cost or what does drilling cost or what does a mud job cost is very dynamic, very real time and it's very transactional. The international market still continues to be a long-term contract market. So the discussions that you have with customers around price concessions and scope changes is typically done within the context of an existing long-term contract, which gives you more of a seat at the table and more of an ability to convince the customer that what you're delivering is adding value or that you have ideas where their contracts can get more efficient and therefore reduce their cost per BOE. And customers always have the ability to go out on tender, but those things typically take a while to come to fruition. So I think really the velocity by which business is done in North America is quite faster than it does in the international market. And therefore, I think the margins will stay up at a higher level and not be compressed down to US levels.
Scott Gruber: That's good color. How should we think about the contract real risk then over the medium term, especially in light of these pricing concessions? So if I recall, the contract role risk was material last recovery period. The starting point for pricing was obviously very high going into 2009. But just given the renegotiations that are ongoing today, does this minimize the contract role risk as we think about potential recovery in '17, '18?
Jeff Miller: I think the - this is an international question?
Scott Gruber: Yes, focused on international, yes.
Jeff Miller: Yes, and so one of the things that we typically see internationally obviously that cycle lags the US cycle. And again these are also economies, in many cases, that are built around production of oil and gas. And so from an activity perspective, they tend to be, on a relative basis, more resilient. The second thing it does is it does provide the opportunity to better manage the work with some visibility, which helps us support margins and the second work with clients who are committed to a level of activity to then optimize that level of activity and that serves, I think, both our customers and us.
Scott Gruber: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Dan Boyd: Hi, thanks. Dave, can you update us on your mature field strategy, the opportunities you are seeing in this market? And then, sort of specifically, maybe tie that to Latin American margin projections going forward. I was under the assumption that mature fields was becoming a bigger piece of the pie in Latin America. So I'm wondering if once you adjust cost to the lower level of activity, can we actually see margins trend higher after the first quarter?
Dave Lesar: Thanks. These are a good opportunity and we're seeing more of them. But I would say they are still on a relative basis a small part of our business. Market conditions are creating demand for these sorts of investments, but clearly they bring a different risk profile. And so with that, they've got to have some key criteria like good rocks, good terms and service pull-through. And so when we look in a commodity price like the one today, these projects will be more challenged. And what happens in those is we'll slow down activity around those the same as any operator would.
Dan Boyd: Okay. And then unrelated follow up, but can you give us an update on the additional costs you're carrying in North America in preparation for the Baker acquisition?
Christian Garcia: The costs associated with the service delivery platform that we're keeping intact remains essentially the same in the last two quarters. It ran somewhere between 300 to 400 basis points and it remains at that level in the fourth quarter.
Dan Boyd: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead: Hey. Good morning.
Dave Lesar: Good morning, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead: I was curious on the CapEx front at $1.6 billion, how would we characterize say maintenance as a percentage of that?
Christian Garcia: We really don't look at it that way. Most of the maintenance expenditure is actually expensed and as such our CapEx is pretty much based on the line of sight contracts and also the implementation of our strategic initiatives like the Q10.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. And then you expect that $1.6 billion - I know there is a lot of change in the marketplace, clearly, but that $1.6 billion, you feel confident is based on existing contracts and not much movement on that going forward?
Christian Garcia: Yes, yes. Let me give you kind of an indication of how we run our capital program. Our capital program, as I said is based on line of sight contracts, as well as the implementation of strategic initiatives. But as you know, we manufacture our own equipment. That gives us really a good ability to ramp down and ramp up depending on the market conditions that we're seeing. So if you recall, in 2015, we began the year with guiding to flat CapEx to 2014 and ended up being down about 30% versus 2014. So that manufacturing capability has become a significant advantage here in this environment. So the fact that we can ramp up and ramp down, we're going to adjust our CapEx program depending on the market conditions that we're seeing in 2016, and if we do so, we will communicate that to the street.
Kurt Hallead: All right, thanks. And then a follow-up would be you mentioned, Christian, North American decremental margins in low single digits during the fourth quarter. Do you feel you guys are at a point where the combination of your cost-reduction efforts. And maybe good handle on where this market may be heading is that the decrementals you would continue to expect in North America as you move forward?
Christian Garcia: Well, we take it one quarter at a time, Kurt, if you think about Q1, if you look at our decrementals for the whole year in 2015, it was - for North America it was about 40%. And if you do the math implied by our guidance for Q1, the sequential decrementals would be less than that, which incorporates the lower activities from a continuing decline in the US rig count, as well as not having the completion tools repeat in the first quarter. So we're taking it one quarter at a time.
Kurt Hallead: Okay. That's great color. I do appreciate it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Sean Meakim: Hi, good morning.
Dave Lesar: Good morning.
Christian Garcia: Morning.
Sean Meakim: On your international margin performance, I was just trying to look at it a little bit differently. I'm curious how much of the mix shift between offshore and onshore and spend the last couple of years has helped your margins and how that could be a benefit going forward?
Jeff Miller: I think it's more of a shift between exploration and development may have a bigger impact than maybe onshore or offshore. Onshore is certainly an important and growing piece of our business in certain markets. But when we get to not only drilling, but also completions of the development space is right in our wheelhouse and we've seen, as the markets have contracted, quite a move that direction.
Dave Lesar: If I can add to that, if you look at where Europe, Africa would have the most concentration of offshore is really the weakest. However, we also saw out performance in that region and the Middle East, Asia has the highest concentration of mature fields and we also outperformed in that region. So both regions have been outperforming both on the onshore and offshore segments of our business.
Sean Meakim: Right. Those are fair points. Thank you. And then just back to North America. On Frac of the Future, do you guys have an update of where your Q10 mix stands today and what you think it would look like at the end of the year based on the new CapEx guide?
Christian Garcia: Right. At the end of the year, we had about 60% of our fleet is Q10, so actually that's higher than what we've guided during our Analyst Day. We said 50% by the end of 2016. We are at 60% right now and based on our capital plan, it should reach close to 75% by the end of 2016.
Sean Meakim: Perfect. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Michael LaMotte: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Dave, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the comment in the press release about the CGG collaboration? What is entailed in that agreement and where you think it goes?
Jeff Miller: Yes, this is Jeff. Look, we're excited about that arrangement and we think it's a great combination. A couple of points though, I think it demonstrates the value of DecisionSpace and its ability to adapt to and help in seismic interpretation. It also, I think, the relationship advances our position there and our access to data to further develop fab software and serve a broader group of customers. The other thing that it does from our perspective is it puts us in the seismic interpretation part of that business where we believe it is - where there is a lot of value, but then keeps us out of the seismic acquisition business.
Michael LaMotte: Is there any potential pull-through on other services you think once you are in the door at the interpretation level?
Jeff Miller: Well, I think that we'll work together. But I think the ability to advance the software and have bigger data sets to work with will always pull through, probably more in the software space than more traditional services. But clearly we believe this is a positive move by Landmark.
Michael LaMotte: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Jim Wicklund: Good afternoon, guys. 
Dave Lesar: Good afternoon, Jim.
Jim Wicklund: How long will it take the industry to respond if oil prices one day were to go up and activity one day started to move up? How long would it take the industry to recover 15% of activity in terms of people, but industry overall?
Jeff Miller: Jim, this is Jeff. I'd love to have that conversation with you. I think that it would be a real mix of response and by that I mean the service industry broadly has been beaten up pretty good at what we believe are unsustainable prices. But I think from our perspective, at least at Halliburton, I'm confident that we would respond quite quickly. If you recall, it was just 2014 when we hired more than 20,000 people onto the payroll at Halliburton. And then the way we're taking care of our equipment now, I talked about the maintenance processes and the Q10 pumps, our ability to respond would be fairly quick.
Jim Wicklund: Okay. I appreciate that. And you talk about slower velocity in the international sector. We've seen guys like Chevron and obviously Pemex in Brazil cut CapEx. Usually they are done, like I said, more on a lower velocity level, more annual, longer-term contracts. How soon US onshore can react immediately. How long will it take the NOCs and IOCs to start to pick up activity, will it take an annual turn?
Jeff Miller: Yes, again, you're right that that velocity is slower, but at the same time it doesn't slow down as quickly. So typically, we have seen that about a six-month lag behind the US internationally in terms of activity build, though it just tends to be more stable. A lot of government approval is required and partner requirements to get that ramped up. But inside of existing projects, I would say within six months to a year that activity could pick back up.
Jim Wicklund: Six months to a year, okay. My unrelated follow up, how many lower tertiary completions do you expect to do this year versus how many did you do last year?
Jeff Miller: Look, again, a bit of a moving target, so I won't comment. If you think about it though as the lower tertiary is certainly a positive piece of our business. We love our position there with our ESTMZ and some of our other capability in the lower tertiary.
Jim Wicklund: Okay, gentlemen. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Rob Mackenzie from Iberia Capital. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Rob Mackenzie: Great. Thanks for fitting me in guys. My question, I guess it's for Christian on receivables. Can you give us a feel for how much of your receivables might be with E&P companies that are distressed or at risk of being distressed to get a feel for the risk we might see for capital accounts?
Christian Garcia: As Jeff pointed out in his prepared remarks, one of the key tenets of our strategy is customer alignment and based on that, the concentration of our customer in North America, 17 customers represent 50% of our revenues and those are the largest companies with better balance sheets that can withstand this downturn. Now, as such, we don't have much exposure to the smaller guys, not to say that we're totally immune. But there is much, much lower than other service providers in the market today.
Rob Mackenzie: Okay. And my related follow-up I guess would be a similar question internationally, vis-à-vis, NOCs such as PDVSA, Pemex, et cetera?
Christian Garcia: Absolutely. There is no question they have been slow paying. In fact, if you look at their base working capital, that's gone up. Good to say that we lead in that metric and I think we've widened the gap against our peers. But in terms of international, those are the largest companies in the world and we don't expect to have issues there as well.
Rob Mackenzie: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Okay, thank you, Danielle. So I'd like to wrap up the call with just a couple of key points. First, we continue to manage the near term, controlling costs, while managing to our clients' fluid capital spend outlooks. Second, we remain committed to positioning Halliburton for the recovery, which means delivering efficient technology that lowers the cost per BOE for our clients, while aligning with those clients with stronger balance sheets and fairway acreage positions. I thank you. I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Danielle, you can close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood, Halliburton's Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's Web site for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Mark McCollum, Chief Integration Officer, will also join us during the question-and-answer portion of the call. During our prepared remarks, Dave will provide an update on the pending Baker Hughes transaction. However, due to the ongoing regulatory review, today we will not be taking any questions today related to regulatory matters. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. And unless otherwise noted in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release, which can be found on our Web site. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. As expected, it was another very challenging quarter for the services industry. Activity levels and pricing took another hit across the globe, as our customers respond to the impact of reduced commodity prices, and the pressure that their own shareholders are putting on them. Considering the difficult headwinds that were working against us, I'm actually very pleased with our overall financial results for the third quarter, especially for our Eastern Hemisphere operations. Now, let me cover some of the key headlines. Total company revenue of $5.6 billion declined 6% sequentially, outperforming our largest peer. I'm very pleased with the resilience of our international business, where we again outperformed our largest peer on both a sequential and year-over-year basis for both revenue and margins. This demonstrates once again that we are not getting distracted as we go through the merger process, and I'm confident that from what we are seeing in the marketplace, this is the same for Baker Hughes. And despite lower revenues as a result of pricing concessions and activity reductions, we were able to maintain operating margins due to a relentless focus on cost management. As expected, North America revenue and operating income declined further as a result of lower activity levels and pricing pressure. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance. From the peak that we saw last November, our completions related activity has declined approximately 18%, relative to a 58% reduction in the U.S. land rig count. This clearly demonstrates the customer flight to quality that has emerged during this downturn, and it positions us well for when the market recovers. And finally, we took an additional restructuring charge to reflect current market conditions. But let me remind you, as we approach the finish line on the Baker Hughes acquisition, we continue to maintain North American infrastructure well beyond current market needs, incurring a cost which we would have otherwise eliminated. This cost impacted North America margins by approximately 400 basis points in the third quarter. Now, turning to operations, in North America prices continue to erode during the third quarter, impacting the total services industry profitability, obviously including ourselves. We believe these prices are clearly unsustainable, but as we have been saying all along, pricing cannot stabilize until activity stabilizes. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, visibility is murky at best. Based on current feedback, we believe most operators have exhausted their 2015 budgets, and will take extended breaks, starting as early as thanksgiving. Therefore our activity levels could drop substantially in the last five weeks of the year. In my 22 years in this business, I've never seen a market where we've had less near-term visibility. In reality, we are managing this business on a near real-time basis, customer-by-customer, district-by-district, product line-by-product line, and, yes, even crew-by-crew. But you know me, and you know our management team. Nobody knows the North America land market better than us. We are the execution company, and we know what leverage to pull to make this market work. Our view is that the first quarter could end up being a mirror image of the fourth quarter. So, just as the fourth quarter is facing a steep drop-off post Thanksgiving, we expect to see a slow ramp up beginning in January, and improving from there, suggesting that the first quarter could be the bottom of this cycle. If you pull back and look at the full year 2016 and compare it to 2015, you could envision a similar mirror image, directionally a slow start and then perhaps picking up speed in the second half of the year. Now, there obviously are a number of moving parts in North America, and I'm not confident enough yet to call the exact shape on this recovery. But we do expect that the longer it takes, the sharper it will be. Until then, we will continue to execute on our strategy, and we will be watching the same external data points that you do: What is happening to oil production? What is the rig count doing? What is happening with operators' cash flows, and how are re-determinations impacting our customers' credit lines? And in addition, we have our own proprietary internal metrics that we will follow. We will continue to adjust our cost structure to market conditions, but to me it does not make sense to reduce costs or infrastructure to reflect expected fourth quarter's reduced activity levels. Instead, we are positioning our North America land business for future success, and to ultimately outperform the industry as the market recovers. Internationally, I remain very happy with where our business is today. The international markets have held up better than North America, but they are not immune to the impacts of lower commodity prices. We did experience lower prices during the quarter, but in anticipation of these reductions we aggressively went after further cost adjustments. And although we had to concede some on pricing, we have worked closely with our customers during the past year to improve their project economics through technology and operating efficiency. Internationally, for 2016, we expect to see a continuation of trends from 2015. Land-based activity, including mature fields should be the most resilient, while we expect offshore to see additional project delays. Now I'd like to provide you with an update on the Baker Hughes acquisition. During the quarter, we announced the second tranche of businesses to be marketed for sale in connection with the acquisition of Baker Hughes, and we expect that marketing process to begin shortly. On the first tranche of divestitures, we have now moved into the negotiation process. On the regulatory front, during the quarter, the timing agreement with the DoJ was extended by three weeks, and accordingly, Halliburton and Baker Hughes agreed to extend the closing date to December 16th. Outside of the U.S., we continue to make progress with completing the required filings, and obtaining the necessary approvals. Specific to the European Commission, we are working cooperatively to respond to their information requests, and expect to resubmit our filing in the near future, which will start the formal review process. Let me be very clear. We remain confident this deal will be approved. We continue to target a 2015 close, but the transaction could move into 2016, which is allowed under the merger agreement. We are enthusiastic about, and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction and achieving our annual cost synergy target of nearly $2 billion. I want to be clear, this $2 billion will be on top of any cost reductions that we've made to date. We are very excited about the benefits of this combination, and what it will provide to the shareholders, customers, and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination with Baker Hughes will create a bellwether global oil field services company, combining our highly complementary suites of services and products into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of cost effective solutions to our customers. Now, let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?
Christian Garcia: Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our third quarter results to the second quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of 5.6 billion represented a 6% decline, while operating income declined 21% to 506 million. North America led the decline as a result of continued activity and pricing headwinds. For our international business, third quarter revenue declined by 5%, while operating income margins remained unchanged to second quarter levels. The impact of price negotiations with our customers in the first half has been offset primarily by a proactive reduction in operational cost. In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue declined by 4% with a similar decline in operating income of 3%. Lower activity levels across the Asia Pacific markets were partially offset by increased activity in the UAE and Iraq. Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, we saw our third quarter revenue decline by 7%, with a decrease in operating income of 9%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by lower activity in Angola and East Africa. Latin America revenue and operating income both declined 4% during the quarter, driven primarily by reduced activity in Mexico. Partially offsetting this decline was improved unconventional activity levels in Argentina. Moving to North America, revenue declined 7% with operating income at near breakeven levels. Reduced activity levels throughout U.S. land were accompanied by further price reductions across the business, especially in the pumping-related product lines. Globally, the continued activity declines and pricing pressures led us to take additional actions to adjust the cost structure. As a result, we incurred an additional restructuring charge of 257 million after tax in the third quarter consisting primarily of asset write-offs and severance-related costs. As this market plays out, we will evaluate our operations and make further adjustments as required. Our corporate and other expense totaled 58 million for the quarter, and we estimate that our corporate expenses for the fourth quarter will be approximately $65 million. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter came in a bit higher at 29% due to the impact of gains from our foreign currency hedging program. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27% for the fourth quarter. Given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we are reducing our capital expenditure guidance by an additional 200 million to $2.4 billion for the year. This represents a 27% year-over-year decline. However, our Q10 program remains intact as we derive significant cost savings from its deployment, and the Q10 provides us the ability to address the higher completions intensity experienced by the industry. Finally, let me give you some comments on our operations outlook starting with our international business. We believe the typical seasonal uptick in year end sales will be minimal this year, as customer budgets are exhausted, and may not fully offset continued pricing pressures. As such, we expect fourth quarter revenue and margins to come in flat to modestly lower, compared to the third quarter. In North America, the prospects of reduced borrowing capacity for operators, and a prolonged holiday season make the fourth quarter challenging and difficult to predict. So far, the average horizontal rig count is down a little less than 10% from the third quarter average. If these headwinds play out, we estimate that the fourth quarter average horizontal rig count could drop about 15% to 20% sequentially. We expect our North America revenues and margins to decline, but we anticipate sequential decrementals to be only in the mid-teens due to our cost reduction efforts. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Christian, and good morning everyone. To begin, I would like to take this opportunity to commend our operational teams for once again executing to our playbook. I am telling you we are not distracted. I particularly like to recognize the performance of our international employees for staying dead focused on our business in a very difficult market. Now, what’s on everyone’s mind is North America. So let me give you a little more granularity on North America by division. Our drilling-related businesses have been much more resilient than our completions related businesses. In fact, drilling division margins increased this quarter to 10%, and this is including the 400 basis point impact of the added cost that we are carrying in anticipation of the Baker Hughes acquisition. Obviously, the most stressed part of our business is pumping. Now, this is the business that we know the best. It’s the business that recovers the fastest. It’s the business that recovers the most sharply, and we know what that path looks like. It looks like this. It looks like staying with the fairway players in the basins that we know. It does not mean chasing every stake. It looks like staying with the customers that are loyal, even if that means working at a price that we don’t like, collaborating on our path forward that lowers their costs per BOE to a place where we can both be successful, and it looks like staying with the overall strategy to focus on long-term returns; meaning, we see a path to profitability. This is a very simple solution, but simple does not mean easy. So if you are looking for a silver lining here, the most competitive piece of the business, pumping, is the one that we know the best. It’s the business that recovers the fastest and the most sharply, and you can be confident that we have the team that gets it done. Last time we reported earnings, oil was in the upper 50s, and the outlook was cautiously optimistic. Since then, we saw oil drop into the 30s, which I can tell you elicited an immediate and visceral reaction from our customer base. And as I described at a conference during the quarter, the rig count followed the oil price down soon thereafter. Now, this has caused us to continue to look carefully and strategically at the business and how we're structured to execute. In the short-term, we further adjusted our operations. Recent actions we’ve taken include partnering with our suppliers to find better ways to work together in these tougher times. Leveraging our logistics infrastructure, including higher rate usage of unit trains, and stacking additional equipment during the quarter where we either were unable to make an acceptable return, or cannot see a path to acceptable returns, and finally, rightsizing the business to reflect current activity levels. Unfortunately, since the beginning of the year, market conditions have forced us to reduce our global headcount by over 21%. Now, these are always tough decisions affecting great people, but they are simply decisions that we have to make. Consistent with maintaining our service delivery model to obtain the cost synergy savings in the Baker acquisition, we’ve taken a bottoms-up look at our service processes, including comparing our current structure to previous similarly-sized markets. This is an examination of how we work. Those things absolutely require to deliver our value proposition, which also means stripping away everything that is not required. For example, in the third quarter, we eliminated an entire level of management in North America. In my view, this is not a one-time initiative. By clarifying and controlling how we execute, we can retain this efficiency, these cost savings as the market recovers. We have a two-pronged strategy. The first part being to control what we control in the short-term. And the second is looking beyond the cycle and preparing for the recovery. Q10 is our great example. The cost savings we derive from these new generation fleets is substantial compared to legacy equipment; 25% less capital on location, 30% less labor on site, and up to 50% less maintenance cost. Q10 spreads now represent close to 50% of our fleet, and we should be near 60% by the end of the year. At the same time, those legacy assets that are still deployed are being strategically placed to maximize our potential in locations, or functions that maximize their cost effectiveness.  While the industry is seeing average fleet sizes increase by 15% to 20% over the last two years due to rise in completions intensity, our average fleet size has been essentially flat as a result of the more efficient Q10s. So when coupled with our logistics platform, we believe Halliburton offers the lowest total cost of service to our customers at any point in the cycle. We are pleased with our customer portfolio. Both in North America and on an international basis, we’ve aligned with customers who have strong balance sheets and assets in the fairway positions in the basins. These are the customers that have better well economics, and are continuing to work through the downturn, and are engaged in the important cost per barrel discussions. Improving a customer's cost per barrel of oil equivalent is core to our value proposition. This is why we continue to invest in technology, and our emphasis is two basic tenants. One is increasing reliability, eliminating moving parts, simplifying designs, and helping eliminate nonproductive time at the well site. The second is making better wells. Products like AccessFrac, CoreVault, and DecisionSpace help customers identify, and access the sweet spots of their reservoirs. And more importantly, these products are seeing increased uptake during this downturn. Adoption of DecisionSpace is up double digits from 2014, for example. And the usage of AccessFrac has grown more than 60% over the last year. There is no question that this is a challenging market today. But our playbook remains the same. We are looking through this cycle to ensure that we will accelerate our growth when the industry recovers. And we are managing through the downturn by drawing on our Management's deep experience in navigating through past cycles. In the long term, we anticipate that unconventionals, mature fields, and deepwater will offer the most significant growth opportunities. That hasn’t changed, although each of these markets faces economic challenges right now. Ultimately, when this market recovers, we believe North America will respond the quickest, and offer the greatest upside. And Halliburton is best positioned to outperform.  Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Dave for closing remarks.
Dave Lesar: Okay, to sum up. We continue to make progress with the Baker Hughes acquisition, and we are diligently focused on finalizing all regulatory matters, completing the divestiture process, and preparing for integration activities after closing the deal. We are managing the downturn by executing our two-pronged strategy, getting down to our purest form of cost, while retaining the flexibility to grow in our usual disciplined way, as activity levels recover. For the fourth quarter, there's a lot of uncertainty as we approach the holiday season. But we believe that customer budgets will reload in the first quarter, and anticipate activity to ramp up in the second half of 2016. Looking ahead, we're not going to try to call the exact shape of recovery. But we do believe that the longer it takes, the sharper it will be. And when that recovery comes, we expect North America will offer the greatest upside, and that Halliburton will be best positioned to lead the way. And finally, there is no doubt that this is going to be a bumpy road. But history would tell you that we have outperformed in these kinds of markets, turning them into a new catalyst for growth. We are the execution company. So you can be sure that whatever the market gives us, we will take it, and then take some more. Now, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open, please go ahead.
Jud Bailey: Thank you, good morning. I wanted to start off by asking about your international margins, where you continue to put up good results in spite of the downturn? Could you give us a little more color, first of all, on the resiliency of your margins, and what you are doing there to keep those at relatively flat levels of 2Q, and year-over-year? And also, how should we think about margin progression internationally in 2016 with pricing continuing to come down and offshore activity probably going to be weak again?
Jeff Miller: Yes, thanks, Jud, this is Jeff. Well, look, really these guys internationally are absolutely on top of their business. So they are, you know, as you say, continuing to outperform our competitors in a very tough market, and it really gets down to a couple of things. They are winning the right contracts and they are winning quite a few important contracts in markets that are important to them, and also managing the heck out of their costs. And so -- and this is a team that I fully expect will continue to outperform even when the market starts to recover.
Christian Garcia: Jud, this is Christian. Let me take the question -- your question on 2016. If you look at how our margins behaved on a year-to-date basis, our international margins actually had improvement despite revenues lower by 11%. So we actually had incrementals this year. If fact, we are compressed with a margin gap between us and our largest competitor by about 200 basis points in a scenario where our revenues declined less. Now, in 2016, it is unrealistic for us to think that we can continue to see our margin increase or even remain at these levels over the next year, given that we are going to continue to deal with a tough environment. Now, in terms of margin progressions or decrementals, it would be very dependent on the magnitude of the declines between activity and pricing, and it is way too difficult to say at this point, but I will tell you we will continue to aspire to continue to outperform our competition.
Jud Bailey: All right, thanks for that. And then I guess my follow-up, maybe for Dave, if I could just follow up on your comment to clarify the mirror image that you see maybe from 1Q relative to 4Q. Do you think we can actually see revenues rebound modestly, it sounds like in the first quarter. And if so, did the margins slip down a little bit more in the first quarter, or do you think they can hold stable with where you come in, in the fourth quarter?
Dave Lesar: I think it really depends. Obviously, there has to be, and there will be a budget reload that takes place in Q1. I think the big question mark is how fast do our customers go back to work once they do reload their budgets, given off what we think we will be a relatively low rig count volume in the latter part of the quarter, especially in December. So it really depends on the bounce back, but the cash will be there. And I think one of the things that our customers demonstrate, and believe me, we love all our customers. If they have cash they are going to spend it. And so, really, it depends on how quickly they want to ramp up, but I do think that as we look at the potentiality of Q1, if there is a slow ramp up that gets a little better toward the end of the first quarter, I think that could be the bottom from a margin standpoint then at that point in time. And then my comment about sort of the rest of 2016 for North America looking a bit like a mirror image of 2015, if you get off the mark slow on your spend, then I think it really does come a little stronger in the back half of the year, and that gives us some hope at this point in time.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Sean Meakim: Thank you, good morning.
Dave Lesar: Good morning.
Sean Meakim: I was hoping, Dave, just to get your perspective, maybe from Jeff as well. Looking at, we've got call it may be at least half or more than half of the pumping equipment on the sidelines these days. Do you have any sense of how much of that equipment is unlikely to come off the fence once there is a call on it? And does the duration of the downturn increase or increase what that could look like in terms of attrition?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Sean. If we look at the amount of horsepower that's idled right now, just on the side lines, about half of it is on the sidelines today in terms of stacked equipment. And that’s equipment that’s not getting any maintenance, and it's being cannibalized for parts. The other factor that we see now, service intensity continues to increase actually on a per well basis. And so, that’s yet again harder on the equipment that is working. So if we look at what’s stacked today, we think about half of that equipment stacked today will not be ultimately serviceable. So that maybe in their estimates four to six million horsepower out of the market in ’16, and that’s very realistic. If we go back and think about 2013 Q4, we had talked about a 30% or so overhang of equipment then, and that capacity overage narrowed to 5% by the end of Q1 of ’14. So that didn’t happen in 90 days. That happened throughout that downturn period. So, the takeaway is that’s exactly why we are committed to Frac of the Future, and having equipment in place, it's able to perform in this environment.
Sean Meakim: That’s very helpful. Thank you. I guess just a follow-up on North America. What do you think E&Ps need to see in terms of not just higher oil prices but their perceived sustainability of those higher levels? And if we don't see, maybe the number $60-plus WTI early in 2016, is there a point at which you think that starts to put a second half recovery at risk?
Dave Lesar: I think you can -- this is Dave, you can argue all the macroeconomics, where is the breakeven price point. I think it's –- there's really actually, I think, a different way you need to think about the customer base in North America, especially the independent customer base. And that’s essentially with the high decline curves that exist on these unconventional plays. They are really are in drill or die mode. So if you go a year without drilling a well, and your production starts to turnover, you are going to have to start drilling or you are going to have to take your infrastructure apart that you’ve built up as a company. So I think that as we get to the end of the year, if these guys have money, they are going to drill it up, and that’s just the fact that it is. Now, oil is at 60, I think the banks will be more comfortable with extending lines of credit with the debt positions that are there, but I think that the real key is going to be the production declines you see, and when these companies get to the point where they have to start drilling or they have to start dismantling their companies, and they are not going to want to do that.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question from David Anderson from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
David Anderson: Thanks. So in regards to your cost control efforts, you mentioned on the call, removing an entire level of management in North America. That got me thinking here can you may be expand a bit in terms of what this redundancy was, and perhaps maybe with some of the other opportunities to remove fixed costs from your system?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks. As we look at how we do business, we get a lot of opportunities to clarify precisely what are those moving parts. And so as we look at what’s absolutely required to deliver in terms of span and control, and oversight of process execution, it became clear that there was a service line component in North America, an entire layer that we were able to remove. This is really -- we can do that, because of the discipline that we have around how we execute process. And as that has continued to tighten, we’ve actually seen at into the downturn, service quality getting better, not worse. And that’s unusual actually going into a market like this. I attribute that to the discipline around execution. And so that then allows us to remove that layer as we -- so that’s that that thought. If we think about other opportunities, we are constantly evaluating things that we can do to take cost out of our business, and this is in North America and the rest of the world in terms of maintenance process, value engineering exercises, kaizen events. So we are highly engaged in looking at those opportunities.
David Anderson: So as it relates to -- as you're saying the nearly $2 billion in cost synergies after closing Baker Hughes, I was just curious if that, what you just talked about, impacts that $2 billion number at all? Obviously market conditions have deteriorated. So I assume there are some give and takes around that figure. Can you maybe provide a little bit of color around maybe some of the expectations of how this changed at all or maybe are there more opportunities or is there maybe a little bit less opportunities considering the market has shifted obviously?
Dave Lesar: No, I mean we are absolutely confident in the synergies of nearly $2 billion that we’ve talked about, and I say that because those aren’t synergies associated with necessarily the market-related taking out a layer at Halliburton that we were talking about. These are more around changing basic ways that we work that then drive meaningful, sustainable savings. And they range -– won't give you too much granularity on them, but it is the way that we, for example, plug into North America's supply chain being an example of that. I mean, that is a very valuable asset that immediately allows cost savings that are very sustainable. We can think about the same things in technology in a lot places around the company, where changing the way we work together is actually going to eliminate that, the bigger piece of cost.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita: Thanks. Good morning, guys, and good job on international. It's pretty impressive. So if we think about North America, and if we go back to actually about 2012, when we had significant overcapacity and pressure pumping, and you think about going into 2013 and 2014 we had no movement in price, but you saw steady increases in your margin on activity gains, and increasing utilization. So if we think about the cycle, and then Jeff you made the reference that you see the path for a return of profitability in North America, so if we think about this cycle going into 2016 and 2017, have you guys have done some work to think through where you need to be on utilization or even a rig count to get back into those high single-digit margins, and even move back into the double-digit margins, could you then see high single-digit margins at 1,100 to 1,200 rig count, assuming we get there in 2017?
Dave Lesar: Thanks, Angie. Yes, I mean the playbook as I described is as simple, but not easy. And it means that we stay with the customers that can be efficient -- that want to be efficient, and that are in the fairways. We stay in the basins where the efficiency matters, and by matters, I mean it always matters, but it matters the most to us when it creates a critical mass that allows us to leverage up on the volume and take advantage of our lowest unit cost delivery. And then finally, there's clients with the sense of urgency. And by sense of urgency, I mean the urgency to keep the equipment working, which ultimately does drive outsized profitability for Halliburton. And so with activity, I see the same the path as we saw before. That hasn’t changed at all.
Angie Sedita: All right. So your thought would be, we could move back to those single-digit margins, high single-digit margins even in a muted recovery, in 2016 going into 2017, even double-digit margins?
Dave Lesar: Yes, absolutely.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from James West from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
James West: Hey, good morning guys.
Dave Lesar: Hi, James. Good morning.
James West: David or Jeff, you guys talk to your customers every single day. And I'm curious about how those conversations are evolving, given that the vast majority of them are facing production declines next year. And, Dave, I know you highlighted you either dismantle your business or you drill, but is there some percentage of the companies out there that are willing to allow production declines in '16, and not get after it?
Dave Lesar: So, I think it really depends on what their bankers are going to let them do or whether their stock price has reasonably well held up in this market. Obviously, some of our customers had their share prices just crushed, and some have pulled back, but also to the point where they do believe that maybe they can go back in the market for equity if there is a more optimistic view of where WTI prices are. I think the customer discussions are really -- we’re going to wait and see right now, but we are going to reload our capital for next year. Some of them are talking about getting back to work as early as January, coming off a Q4 lull, and some, I think, are going to take a bit of a wait and see, but I think very, very few of them, and certainly I don’t think I’ve had a single discussion where the customer are going to let themselves get into a position of a meaningful decline in production before they figure out a way to start drilling again. And then there is another group of customers out there that really view that there is a subset of the customer base that will not get access to money, that will see a decline, that have good acreage, and they are going to be absolutely juicy takeover candidates at that point. So I think it's just we just got to wait and see the -- these re-determinations are going on, and it looks, generally to me, like it’s a sort of kick-the-can-down-a-road approach that's being taken at this point. But that really just pushes the day of reckoning into sort of the first quarter of next year. But the reality is that the strong customers are going to survive. They are going to have money, and they’re going to drill at some point next year.
James West: Got it. And then a follow-up for me on North America; pricing, obviously visibility is not great, so pricing is still a little sloppy here. But at what point do you say, all right, enough is enough, we're not going to go down further, or I guess the flipside is the attrition rate is picking up pretty quickly with your smaller competitors. At what point can pricing does not drop because the competition has basically gone away?
Jeff Miller: Yes, well, the -- yes, when we look at -- I won't give you a price, James, on the call, but what I will tell you is that we look at a number of factors when we look at customers challenging as it is right now. And so, I’ll give you not the price, but I will talk about the factors. So we absolutely look at the efficiency as clearly a component of how we look at pricing. It’s also again customers and basins where we not only see resilience, and customers able to execute. So it’s not so much a number though we have taken equipment, and we have that equipment in 2015 when we got into situations where it simply did not make sense to put equipment to work.
Dave Lesar: Yes, I guess let me just add to that. I mean there is the point that, yes, we have walked away from work and are walking away from work every day. However, there are some key customers as Jeff said in key basins that have been very loyal to us, and we want to stay loyal to them. We know they are going to survive. We know they have good assets. We know they are going to get a budget reload, and we know that they want to take advantage of the services pricing that's out there today, even if I don’t like that service pricing, it is there. It’s a fact of the market. This is a long-term game we are in. These are long-term customers we have. We typically make good money from them in good times, and I’m not going to walk away from them in the kind of times we are in today because it will pay off in the long run, and I think that’s in my view the smart way to approach this.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Bill Herbert: Thank you. Jeff, or Dave, can you just comment a little bit and/or question with regard to you've given a pretty Darwinian outlook for the fourth quarter in North America, but D&E so outperformed that expectations in the third quarter. Do we see similar resilience in the fourth quarter, or how should we think about that? I mean, C&P is clear, but how should we think about D&E for North America in Q4?
Jeff Miller: I think the -- Bill, this is Jeff. Q4 right now is murky across the piece, and I think it's the unrealistic -- if clients stop working at the thanksgiving, if we look back to 2012, there was significant slowdown around thanksgiving that sort of continue through to the New Year. It would be hard to imagine that D&E is immune to the same activity slowdown. That said, although what it does emphasize is sort of the bifurcation in the marketplace, and how stressed pressure pumping is today. And that’s why I get back to -- and I have a lot of confidence in our team, and our team knows how to manage through market like this.
Bill Herbert: Okay. And question with regard to -- I think I heard you say $2.4 billion in CapEx for 2015, and how should we think about free cash flow generation and working capital harvest for the next few quarters?
Christian Garcia: For the next few quarters, our year-to-date cash flows has been impacted by a couple of things, Macondo legacy payment with restructuring and acquisition-related cost. But if you look at our historical seasonality in cash generation, we typically do not generate a lot of cash in the third quarter anyway. But we generate the majority of our cash for the year in the fourth quarter. So we anticipate that our historical seasonality will hold true for this year, and expect to generate cash in the fourth quarter. So in terms of CapEx, as we pointed out, 2.4 billion took out another 200 million, but as we reiterated in our prepared remarks, we are still committed to the Q10 program.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Scott Gruber: Yes, good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but I had one on the agreement that you guys executed with BlackRock to execute refracs in the US. Can you just provide an update on that? What's been the reception from the E&P community, and has capital been put to work?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Scott. The reality is this is a very small piece of the market certainly today with effect to refract. That said, we are finalizing terms on a deal under that arrangement. I think the real story -- the real and probably more important story is around the technology, the diversion capability, and how that applies not only to refrac and to new wells and how that’s able to improve production to make better wells. The other thing that when we look at refrac is we see it really more as a portfolio approach to asset management, meaning, it’s in the toolbox, it’s something important that clients can use to better manage pressure in the field, pressure sinks, and the relationship between parent wells and daughter wells. So, the takeaway though is that the technology and the funding are both in place and we are well prepared for that as -- or to the extent that it does develop.
Scott Gruber: And as you look out into 2016, do you see an environment where pumping demand could do better than the horizontal rig count for the market as a whole, given some incremental refrac demand and incremental demand to draw down on the drilled but uncompleted?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean when we talk about -- when I think about drilled but uncompleted is arguably deferred revenue, and it makes sense to do when rigs are contract and a company is trying to converse cash. Nevertheless, those are there in the ground and they are ready source cash flow, and so, I think they may end up a little bit uncoupled from the rig count, per se, just because it’s there and needs to be done.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Jeff Tillery: Hi, good morning. Christian, I just have one question around the near-term. You talked about North America relatively harsh year-end, but also relatively shallow decremental margins. So I'm just curious how you manage costs in the near-term to achieve those shallow decrementals.
Christian Garcia: That’s right, decrementals are 67% in the third quarter and we are guiding to a decrementals in the mid-teens in Q4. Well, the reason for that is most of the cost reductions that we did were towards the end of the quarter, savings of which did not have a material impact in the third quarter. So we expect those savings will be in the fourth quarter, and that’s why we expect to see a drop in decrementals quarter-over-quarter.
Jeff Tillery: Thank you. And then just you talked a little bit prospectively about the international margin outlook, but I was just curious of the pricing reductions internationally that have been agreed to to-date, how much of that would you say was realized in the Q3 results? Is it more than half, less than half; just looking for a ballpark?
Jeff Miller: Yes. I mean in terms of -- these are negotiations that seem be that are ongoing, and so, round one arguably occur early in the cycle, actually much was stressed even at 100 in deep water. And so, this has been an ongoing discussion of both negotiation and re-tendering of work. So what we talked about in the last quarter probably a quarter has been -- a quarter to a half has been absorbed during the current quarter though as long as we see pricing -- commodity pricing, where it is, and delays in terms of activity, I wholly expect we will continue to see this. Now, the better discussion that we have with clients is around how to do drive efficiency and how to use those things that are in our value proposition around increasing reliability and reducing uncertainty to help lower their overall cost, and I would say I am pleased that we are having more discussions that look like that with clients as they realize that they reached kind of limits around what’s available in the service sector.
Dave Lesar: Yes, I think -- and let me just add a little bit more color to that, because I think it’s important to sort of sit back and understand where does the customer have a leverage point in these negotiations. So if you go back to a -- let’s say U.S. horizontal unconventional well, and it costs a dollar, about -- say about $0.70 of that dollar is focused on the completion, particularly the frac. So that’s naturally where customers have gone in terms of the pressure to reduce cost. If you go to an offshore kind of a project, the cost is really in the E&C cost, it’s in the day rate and the drilling rig, and other services work that we do is maybe 20% of that. And so, the leverage point that customers have gone for there, and obviously you all follow the sector, has been to the day rates on the drilling contractors and to the E&C companies with a discussion with us on services rates, but we are not the sort of cost tail wagging the dog on the offshore stuff. It’s really the other guys, and that’s really where the pricing leverage has been directed initially.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Dan Boyd: Hi, thanks. So Dave, it sounds like you don't expect a lag between higher oil prices and activity in North America. But what's your best guess on the lag between higher oil prices and the first quarter we may see higher international activity?
Dave Lesar: Yes, that’s a -- it’s actually a great question, and I don’t know the answer to that, but it will be a longer lag, mainly because you look inside of the two sort of I guess tranches of customers internationally. The NOCs have not pulled back as dramatically as the IOCs have, with respect to their deepwater projects. And so, the NOCs I think will -- if you think about sort of a slow wave up and down, I think that’s what you are going to see, but I think that if you look at the economics of deepwater development, I believe the IOCs are going to have to be convinced that not only are the prices at a point where these things can at least cash flow in the long run that they see an upward trajectory in oil prices that they can make a return on these deepwater projects over a period a year. So, it's certainly not going to be the first quarter or two of high oil prices before you see a bounce back in the actual contracting for revenue and the offshore. You might see some feeds startup. You might see some pre-engineering startup. You might see project planning starting up. And all of that would be good, because it’s a sign that they are thinking about going more and quickly into the deeper water, but it's going to be several quarters and it really is going to be building confidence back up in the IOCs that the market is there for the long run.
Dan Boyd: Thanks. Then just the follow-up would be of the three international regions is there one you would expect to respond more quickly?
Jeff Miller: Probably, I could see response in West Africa pretty quickly, the infrastructure is in place. It’s not as hard to startup there as it would be maybe in some other markets, but again the -- there certainly would be the lag that Dave is describing.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from James Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
James Wicklund: Good morning, guys. The Middle East has been one of the better markets for everybody for a while and Saudi always gets mentioned. You guys have a lot of exposure there. There were reports out yesterday, this morning that Saudi like every other oil company I guess out there is being slow to pay its bills. But when we hear that from Saudi we get a little bit more concerned than your credit checks on E&P companies. Can you tell us if you're being impacted by that in Saudi or anyplace else in the world and the implications for that?
Christian Garcia: Jim, as a just general statement, that we are seeing lengthening of payment patterns from our customers, whether it’s in the Middle East or everywhere else, but I am just happy to say that when you look at us versus our peers, our day sales outstanding continues to lead the pack.
James Wicklund: Okay, but you don't have any particular issues in Saudi?
Christian Garcia: No. No, we don’t have …
Jeff Miller: No, I mean I wouldn’t point to anything there.
James Wicklund: Okay. My follow-up, Jeff, getting to double-digit margins by late next year gives me some idea of this, but you make some pretty good points about changes in prices in cost and structural. How much do you think -- and if we assume 30% just as a rounding point, there's been 30% cost deflation to an E&P Company, how much of that 30% do you think will end up being structural several years from now and how much of that will end up being cyclical?
Jeff Miller: Yes, that’s a great question, Jim. I think if the margins are at the tail, the beginning and ending tail, you see sort of dramatic behavior. So I think that, you know, that has not been given away. I think that the path sort of more in the middle will be retained when we get back in balance here with the service companies. So the short answer is I think we keep most of that. We do get most of that back under the right conditions, but the very right hand side of the upper limits that we saw even going back to 2012, and 2009, '10, '11, those sort of numbers -- we stay more sustainable higher margins based on how we execute, how we take off that out of the system, and that maybe preferentially better performance by Halliburton around those things.
Dave Lesar: So, I guess the only thing I would add, Jim, is to the extent we have seen any structural change that we have given up to our customer, we will take the same structural change out of our supply chain. And so, hopefully would end up basically net even.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to now turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.
Jeff Miller: Yes, thank you, Danielle. So I'd like to wrap up this call with just a few key takeaways. First, the pumping business in North America is clearly the most stressed segment of the market today, but it’s also the market that we know the best. We know our approach works when the market turns, and it will. This is the segment that we expect to rebound the most sharply. Second, we are maintaining our North American infrastructure required to accelerate delivery of the Baker Hughes acquisition synergies at a cost of about 400 basis points. And then finally, our international franchise continues to deliver market-leading performance on relative basis both year-over-year, and sequentially in a tough, tough market. So I look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Danielle, you can close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood, Halliburton's Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2015 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Mark McCollum, Chief Integration Officer, will also join us during the question-and-answer portion of the call. During our prepared remarks, Dave will provide an update on the pending Baker Hughes transaction. However, due to ongoing discussions, we will not be taking any questions today related to regulatory matters. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly, any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise noted in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our second quarter press release, which can be found on our website. We had several moving pieces this quarter, so let me help you walk through the numbers. As announced in our press release, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.44, excluding restructuring costs of $0.30 and acquisition related costs of $0.08. However, as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, included in our results was a $0.06 benefit related to the cessation of depreciation expense associated with the assets we are currently marketing in anticipation of the Baker Hughes acquisition. Excluding the depreciation benefit would have resulted in earnings per share for the quarter of $0.38. Going forward, the benefit associated with our assets held for sale should be factored in to your financial models as this is the only quarter that we intend to disclose it separately. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. The services industry obviously experienced another challenging quarter with lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressures across the globe as our customers continue to respond to the impact of reduced commodity prices. Considering the difficult headwinds that worked against us, I am very pleased with our overall financial results for the second quarter. Now, let me cover some headlines. First, total company revenue of $5.9 billion declined 16% sequentially compared to a 26% decline in the worldwide rig count. I'm also very pleased with our Eastern Hemisphere margin expansion, which once again outpaced our primary competitor. We generated nearly $1.2 billion in operating cash flow. Operating income declined as a result of lower activity levels exacerbated by pricing (04:13) declines primarily in North America. Revenue for North America was down 25% sequentially, significantly outperforming the 40% decline in the average rig count. And while the North American rig count declined 40%, our stage count declined less than 10%. Therefore, we believe that a customer flight to quality emerged during the quarter. And this gives us reason to believe that pricing declines may begin to decelerate. And I can tell you, our customers are smart, responsive and adaptable in this market. And although we experienced some weather disruptions, we were able to make up this work later in the quarter. We continue to maintain an infrastructure well beyond current market needs, ahead of the Baker transaction, incurring costs which we would have otherwise eliminated. This impacted margins by 300 basis points to 400 basis points in Q2, and decremental margins this quarter were better than previous cycles, which demonstrates that our aggressive cost reduction initiatives are helping to offset the current market challenges. The U.S. rig count finished the quarter down 55% from the peak in late November, but has moved sideways over the last few weeks. Price erosion continued in the second quarter and is likely to remain fluid in the near term. We anticipate margin compression in the third quarter, but believe it will be driven more by the full impact of pricing declines that we gave up in the second quarter and from lower activity levels more than continued price erosion. In fact, we believe that service pricing for the industry has fallen to unsustainable levels. Last quarter, we described three types of service companies in the market: those making a profit, which weren't very many; those covering cash costs and those operating at a loss, even on a cash basis. During the first quarter, Halliburton was one of just a few companies that posted profits in North America. And we expect the second quarter has been even more challenging for those of us in the industry. As a result, we believe many of the smaller service companies are now operating below cash breakeven levels, which leads to the conclusion that pricing cannot stay at these levels for an extended period. Now, looking ahead, we could begin to see a modest uptick in activity during the second half of this year, which could include increased refrac activity, which Jeff Miller will detail later. However, we are not expecting a meaningful activity increase until sometime in 2016, depending on the pace of production declines and where commodity prices settle out in the coming quarters. Therefore, what we are continuing to do is manage our cost, service our customers that are engaged in this flight to quality, and prepare for the Baker transaction. Now, outside North America, I'm very happy with where our international business is today. Our full year outlook for our international businesses remains unchanged. We still estimate a mid-teens decline in total international customer spend compared to last year. However, we expect to outpace the total market and believe our revenue decline will be less severe. We also anticipate our third quarter Eastern Hemisphere margins will be in the upper teens. Now, let me provide a little bit of international of regional color. In the Middle East/Asia, we see a solid and stable business as project awards across the Middle East are moving forward. Europe/Africa/CIS is challenged today with the North Sea, Russia and Angola markets being the most vulnerable; and in Latin America, operators are struggling with their cash flows. Although the international markets are more resilient than North America, they are certainly not immune to the impacts of the lower commodity price environment. We did experience some pricing declines in the first half of the year, but negotiations are continuing and we will not see lower pricing fully built into our run rate until the second half of the year. In addition, we are continuing to work with our customers to improve project economics through technology and improved operating efficiency. The execution of our strategy in addressing this environment remains the same. We are continuing to employ a two-pronged approach. We are looking through this cycle to ensure that we will accelerate our growth when the industry recovers. To do this, we continue to invest in key technologies, build out capital equipment, and prepare for our pending acquisition of Baker Hughes. The second part of our approach is managing through the downturn joined upon our management's deep experience in navigating through past cycles. We are aggressively lowering our input costs, eliminating discretionary spending, managing our business within our cash flows, and protecting our market position. Now, I would like to provide you with an update on the significant progress we are making towards closing the Baker Hughes acquisition. Let me begin with some of the more recent developments. During the quarter, we began marketing for sale, our Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling, Logging-While-Drilling and Measurement-While-Drilling businesses. In early July, we received nearly 25 indications of interest for each of the businesses, all of which included prices, and we are very pleased with the prices and the response. Because of the high level of interest we received, we are limiting the number of bidders for the second round to only the strongest responses. We expect to complete the auction process sometime this fall with the closing of the divestitures being concurrent with the closing of the larger transaction. We have also recently provided a proposal for additional divestitures to various competition authorities around the world. In aggregate, the total divestitures being considered are still within the scope of those contemplated by us at the time that we announced the transaction. On July 10, both Halliburton and Baker Hughes entered into a timing agreement with the DoJ. Timing agreements are often entered into in connection with large, complex transactions, and provide the DoJ additional time to review responses to its second request. We have agreed to extend the period for their review of the acquisition to the later of November 25, 2015, or 90 days after both companies have certified substantial compliance with the DoJ's second request. I am pleased to say that Baker Hughes did certify substantial compliance on July 14, and we expect to do so shortly. Outside of the U.S., we continue to make progress with the required filings in foreign jurisdictions. Specific to the European Union, we expect to submit our filings later this month, which will start the formal review process. We are fully committed to our target of closing the acquisition in late 2015, though the acquisition agreement does provide the closing can be extended into 2016, if necessary. As we evaluate this transaction and move toward completion, we are confident we can achieve the cost synergies of nearly $2 billion regardless of market conditions or any cost reduction actions taken by either company through that date. In closing, we are enthusiastic about and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction. We are very excited about the benefits of this combination and what it will provide to shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination with Baker Hughes will create a bellwether global oil services company, combining our highly complementary suites of products and services into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of cost-effective solutions to our customers. Now, let me turn the call back over to Christian who will provide you some details on our financial results. Christian?
Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter, we announced our decision to divest our Drill Bits and Drilling, MWD/LWD businesses. These businesses were classified as assets held for sale in the second quarter, and we ceased the associated depreciation and amortization for these assets, resulting in an approximate $0.06 benefit to the quarter. We've included a table in our earnings release quantifying the second quarter profit uplift by geography. To provide better transparency of our current operational trends, the sequential comparisons in my comments today have been adjusted to exclude the special items indicated in our earnings release, as well as the benefit of the lower depreciation, meaning both the first and second quarter results reflect the full depreciation burden in order to have an apples-to-apples comparison. Now, let me provide a comparison of our second quarter results to the first quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.9 billion represented a 16% decline, while operating income declined 18% to $570 million. North America led the decline as a result of lower activity levels and continued pricing pressure across all of our product lines. In the Eastern Hemisphere, second quarter revenue declined by 3%, while operating income increased 17%, representing a 300 basis point margin improvement from the first quarter levels despite activity and pricing headwinds. In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue declined by 5% while operating income showed a modest improvement. Lower activity levels across the Asia-Pacific markets were offset by improved profitability in Iraq, Kuwait and the UAE. We are pleased with the progress of operations in Iraq where margins reached double digits for the first time, which we expect to sustain for the full year. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, we saw second quarter revenue come in flat with operating income increasing by 69%. Seasonal activity improvement's in Eurasia and Norway, along with higher stimulation activity and Completion Tools sales in both Algeria and Angola, drove the improvement for the quarter, offsetting weaker activity levels in the UK and Egypt. Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 19% and 21%, respectively, driven by Venezuela, primarily due to the negative currency impact of the new exchange rate. Partially offsetting this decline was improved profitability in Brazil resulting from the recently retendered Directional Drilling contract. Moving to North America, revenue and operating income declined 25% and 59%, respectively, relative to a 40% reduction in the North America rig count. Lower customer budgets translated into additional reductions in activity levels throughout the second quarter, accompanied by further significant price reductions across all product lines. Our decrementals in the second quarter were 19%, about half of what we experienced in the second quarter of 2009. During the second quarter, we took additional actions to adjust our cost structure due to the continued decline in global activity levels. As a result, we incurred an additional after-tax restructuring charge of $258 million in the second quarter consisting primarily of severance-related costs and asset write-offs. Since the beginning of the year, we've now reduced our global head count by over 16%. We continue to evaluate our operations and will make further adjustments as required to adjust to market conditions. Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $17 million for the quarter. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the third quarter will be approximately $75 million, and this will be the new quarterly run rate for the remainder of 2015. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at 26%, and is expected to be between 26% and 27% for the remainder of the year. We continue to focus on cash flow generation. And given the continued decline in activity levels, we are reducing our capital spend for the year by another $200 million to $2.6 billion, representing a 21% year-over-year decline. Manufacturing our own equipment provides us with the utmost flexibility to adjust our capital spend based on our visibility of the market. Finally, let me give you some comments on our third quarter operations outlook. My guidance commentary will include the benefit of our lower depreciation and amortization run rate from assets held for sale. Starting with the Eastern Hemisphere outlook, we expect to see a full quarter impact of price reductions, which will affect our third quarter results. We currently expect a low to mid single-digit decline in sequential revenues with margins declining modestly into the upper teens. For Latin America, we also anticipate a modest decline in the third quarter for both revenues and margins. In North America, if we extrapolate the current rig count forward, it suggests that the average rig count for the third quarter should decline by at least 5% compared to the prior quarter. This, in combination with the full quarter impact of lower pricing, leads us to believe that revenues and margins in the third quarter will be under pressure. This pattern is consistent with previous cycles where we typically see at least a one quarter lag when the market is transitioning towards the bottom. Based on our visibility today, we're currently expecting a low single-digit decline in sequential revenues with margins also drifting modestly lower. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Thanks, Christian, and good morning. I'd like to start by congratulating our Eastern and Western Hemisphere operations teams for delivering solid results in a very difficult market. We are the execution company and our guys are flat out executing right now. Internationally, we continue to make progress with our mature field strategy. During the quarter, we completed a successful infield drilling program in Malaysia, while mobilizing for projects in Iraq and Russia. In Mexico, we completed drilling the first well using rigs from our joint venture with Trinidad Drilling, setting a new drilling record for South Mexico Mesozoic basin. We're seeing strong interest from our clients tendering new activity, and the global pipeline of opportunities that we're evaluating continues to be in excess of $35 billion. The deepwater economics were challenged in $100 a barrel and are clearly challenged in the current commodity price environment, which is precisely why we are focused on technology that both delivers better production and reduces the structural cost of drilling wells. This generally means removing complete activities from the work stream. A terrific example of this is how Landmark's DecisionSpace software allows clients to reduce drilling days by integrating geological data with well construction design. In a recent deepwater project, this integration reduced drilling time by 15 days by eliminating one entire directional build phase. In another case, the President of another large client was quoted at a recent conference saying that his company reduced its seismic survey data analysis time by 80% through working with Landmark. The point is that Landmark is making a meaningful contribution to our strategy to lower the cost per barrel of oil equivalent for our clients by eliminating activities and reducing structural costs, while also delivering more productive wells. Another example of technology driving efficiency was the delivery of three Lower Tertiary completions in the Gulf of Mexico using our Enhanced Single-Trip Multizone Packer (sic) [FracPac] (22:25) System. The ESTMZ is proving to consistently reduce rig time in these high cost environments. Turning to North America land, the industry saw a sharp 40% sequential decline in the average rig count during the second quarter. Against this backdrop, let me provide a few data points around Halliburton's operations in the quarter. North America revenue was down 25%. Our stage count was down less than 10%. Average profit per well increased 7% sequentially, and finally, approximately 85% of our active fleet continues to work on a 24-hour-a-day operations. And we believe these factors clearly indicate why operators prefer to work with a more reliable service provider like Halliburton for more complex completions. So now that the rig count appears to be scraping along a bottom, what happens next? The exact timing's difficult to predict, but the previous cycles would point us to the following progression of how the story should play out as we move forward. First, activity stabilizing means the healing process can begin with respect to pricing and margins. This will then allow our input cost savings to catch up, and our efficiency programs and well solutions can begin driving margins up. Price improvement will then be a challenge until we see capacity tightening in the market. Therefore, any margin improvement will likely be the result of lowering our cost base. We stacked a nominal amount of equipment during the quarter and expect to put this equipment back to work when the economics justifies doing so. We currently estimate that approximately 40% to 50% of industry capacity has been idled, although our percentage stack is significantly lower. What's unique about this cycle is how service intensity has evolved since 2013. Over the last two years, average job size has essentially doubled. And at the same time, both average pump rates and pressures are also up. On the plus side, bigger jobs mean more revenues and better equipment utilization for us. The downside is we believe larger completions are taking their toll on pumping equipment. In fact, these factors point to higher equipment attrition rates for the industry. Now, this is precisely why we continue to invest in our service efficiency strategy at Halliburton. Close to 40% of our pressure pumping fleet has been converted to Frac of the Future, with a target to reach 50% by year-end. Our customers appreciate the reliability and efficiency of our Q10 units, and we are pleased with the progress in updating our fleet with this more cost-effective model. In addition, the downturn has allowed Halliburton to retool and improve our maintenance and value engineering processes. The result is that in spite of increasing service intensity, our maintenance cost on a per unit basis is trending down, while our service quality and efficiency are the best in company history, differentiating us from our competitors. And while the market has been myopically focused on service pricing, we know that ultimately, it will be lower cost per barrel of oil equivalent that will carry the day. So to this end, in addition to surface efficiency, we continue to deliver technology to help our customers reduce the structural cost of their wells. For example, the Illusion dissolving frac plug, which we launched in the second quarter, will ultimately eliminate the requirement for coil tubing to mill out plugs. The Illusion frac plug provides high-performance isolation during plug-and-perf operations and functions like a normal plug, meaning it does not require any balls, baffles or any sort of special casing design. When dissolved, it leaves the full wellbore open to maximize production. And I'm pleased to see the growing customer interest in using technology for better well placement and better perforation efficiency. An example of this is our proprietary FracInsight solution, which gathers the necessary logging data, but does it in a cased-hole environment, meaning it does not consume valuable rig time required by open hole solutions. In a joint study with a large customer in the Eagle Ford, FracInsight data eliminated the pumping of unnecessary out-of-zone treatments, which helped reduce stimulation costs by over 35% and significantly improved the cost per BOE equation for our customer. Let me spend a minute on refrac technology in the market. We've been involved in refrac operations for decades, and have executed at least twice as many as any other service provider. Although relatively small today, we believe this market has significant potential in the coming years. So why are customers interested? Early horizontal wells were arguably under-stimulated as stages per well are up more than 30% and proppant per well is up more than double since 2010. What's changed is two key components of technology. First is our diversion chemistry that more effectively stimulates wells, and then second is our diagnostic technology to validate those results. Diversion technology, like Halliburton's AccessFrac, more effectively stimulates the entire lateral through better proppant placement, creates greater complexity within the formation, and helps mitigate well bashing scenarios. Thus far, through our candidate selection process and design, AccessFrac contributes an average of 80% increase in estimated ultimate recovery for our refrac clients, while greatly improving the predictability of results. More importantly, AccessFrac is equally effective as a solution on new wells, improving cluster efficiency and delivering 20% to 25% production increases for our customers compared to offset wells. AccessFrac is becoming a standard process for a growing portion of our clients, and is delivering better production and EURs. Our suite of fiber-optic diagnostic tools, deployed either as a permanent installation or on coil tubing, allows us to monitor individual stage results and validate the treatment performance of our refrac solutions. This means that we can demonstrate that our diversion technology and equally critical delivery process together dramatically increase stimulated clusters along the lateral, thereby maximizing our customers' production and EUR. Though a relatively small market today, we see significant runway for refrac in the future. There's an opportunity to address the needs of operators to increase their production and expected ultimate recovery from the tens of thousands of unconventional wells drilled over the last several years. And we anticipate that customers will begin to dedicate a percentage of their annual spend to refracturing operations. Because of our confidence in our technology and ability to lead this market, we've laid the groundwork to execute large-scale refrac operations through alternative business arrangements. To this end, we're pleased to announce that we have entered into a memorandum of understanding with BlackRock to provide a funding mechanism specifically for refrac projects up to $0.5 billion in capital over the next three years. We're pleased to work with a tremendous partner like BlackRock. This arrangement allows Halliburton to focus on candidate selection, execution, and generating best in class returns, while allowing BlackRock to pursue innovative opportunities with their clients. We've seen it before; our customers in unconventionals are highly adaptable, and they are actively seeking the surface efficiencies, downhole technologies and business arrangements that will make the economics work. When the recovery does come, it's our belief that North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside. And when that happens, we are confident that Halliburton will be the best positioned to outperform in the recovery phase of the cycle. I'd like now to turn it back over to Dave for closing remarks.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Jeff. To sum things up, this is a damn tough market, one of the toughest ones that I have ever been through. And I don't believe anyone on the call can accurately predict when commodity prices will rebound and rig counts will recover in the U.S. or the international markets, and neither can I. What I do believe is that when the recovery occurs, North America will offer the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be the best positioned to lead the way. We are pleased with the progress of the proposed Baker Hughes acquisition and are working diligently to close this transaction before the end of the year. Looking ahead, whatever shape you think the recovery will take, we have the products, the technology and the management expertise to outperform the market. We have demonstrated this during the previous cycles and have no reason to believe that this cycle will be any different. As we have said, our customers are smart, responsive and adaptable, and we are already seeing that by working together, we can figure out a way to have both of us earn returns for our shareholders even in this challenged commodity market. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And your first question comes from James West from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: Hey, good morning, guys.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Good morning.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: It looks like contrary to, I guess, popular belief on Friday, you guys did not have to work all weekend to change what you were going to say today, so congratulations on a good quarter.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, thanks, James. Yeah, I had a stress-free weekend, that's for sure.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: Good to hear. A quick question on the North American margins. So, the 300 basis points to 400 basis points of extra cost that you're holding on to right now, is that just Halliburton related costs or are you actually adding to your cost structure in anticipation of the Baker Hughes transaction? And if so, will you have all the railcars to handle those facilities, et cetera, that you need once the transaction closes later this year?
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Yeah, thanks, James. This is Jeff. The – I mean, we have the best operating platform in North America. So when we look at that and anticipate adding a second story basically to the house, our management structure, the operating basis that we have, the logistics infrastructure, including things like Battle Red, and our business development we know are critical to delivering the synergies and delivering them quickly. So as we manage our business, we continue to invest in those things that support that sort of in spite of the market. So the answer is managing our investment in new things, but obviously retaining those things that we know are important.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: Okay. Okay. Fair enough, Jeff. And another question, a follow-up for me related to that one. On the synergy number for the Baker Hughes proposed transaction, it sounds like you're very confident still in that $2 billion number. However, both companies have taken cost reduction efforts. Is that – I mean, are you synthetically raising that synergy number then if you're already – both companies are already going through cost cutting right now?
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Yeah, I mean, that's a way to look at it, but I think what's most important to take away is that the – while market adjustments are required, we want to be crystal clear that the current activities do not impact our view and confidence in the $2 billion worth of post-acquisition synergies.
James C. West - Evercore ISI: Got it. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Thanks, guys. Indeed, a solid quarter, particularly given the market. I guess to (35:56) look forward into 2016 on the U.S. pressure pumping market and just your thoughts on the outlook, not thinking about oil prices, but just the outlook for scrapping of equipment by some of your peers, maybe laying down equipment that's going to be cannibalized and not returning. When you think about 2016, how do you think the pressure pumping market will play out ignoring the oil price scenario?
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Yeah, thanks, Angie. I mean, 2016 looks better than 2015, but I'd like to reframe your question as how really does attrition play out. And for example, I was just out in the Southern region looking up. When I travel, I look at our locations and competitor locations, and I see more equipment than required showing up on competitor locations to compensate for the lack of maintenance and the lack of capital investment. In some cases, two times as much is what would be required. Now, that's attrition in action. And capacity can tighten very quickly, and we saw that in 2014, how quickly attrition – or actually, capacity tightened. So, I mean, that's why we're so committed to Frac of the Future. I mean, it clearly performs in the downturn and it's even more valuable as the industry recovers.
Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then I was actually kind of surprised on the BlackRock side, the transaction. Can you give us a little detail there, further details on how that will play out, the logistics of the arrangement and just some color?
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Well, yeah. I mean, what we see is this is a foundation for growth, and demonstrates our belief that the market grows. And it's clear that the technology enables returns. It also lays the groundwork for us to move quickly at scale. And the short answer is it's set up around a three-year sort of window, I mean, it provides a lot of flexibility for us to act quickly.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Dave, in your prepared comments, you noticed that service pricing is generally unsustainable across all product lines. I was wondering, given the potential for attrition in the industry and given how low pricing is, how do you think – do think pricing can normalize back up to a more reasonable level before we fully utilize the fleet, given the amount of stacked capacity? Or how do you see that first step in pricing playing out given how depressed pricing is and given how much idle capacity there is? Should it normalize a little bit quicker because there is so much stacked capacity and people are investing in their fleets, or is going to take just as long as it has also prior troughs and up cycles?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, I think the – certainly, it's not going to pop back up to where it was even a year ago today. It'll normalize in an incremental fashion, and it's going to be a combination essentially of pricing increases, equalization or equilibrium in terms of equipment across the board, and also allowing the input costs to continue to catch up with where we are. So it's going to be a lot of blocking and tackling, and it's just going to go step-by-step.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you for that. And then my follow-up is on international pricing. Christian, you noted in your prepared comments that taking into account you have a full quarter of lower pricing rolling through, how should we think about in the fourth quarter, have you already adjusted? Are you already seeing a lot of the new pricing rolling through the P&L? Or are we going to have more of an effect as more contracts reprice in the fourth quarter as well?
Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer: Jud, the fourth quarter, it's still early to call what the fourth quarter will look like, but if you think about it, we will still continue to have pricing pressure impacting the fourth quarter. However, we would have the usual seasonal uptick that we experienced on the – during the end of the year.
Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Is it too early to see if you think those can kind of offset each other by the fourth quarter?
Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer: At this point, we think that the seasonal uptick will offset the – any sort of additional pricing impact that we might have in the fourth quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to drill down a little bit further on BlackRock and also kind of broaden the discussion with regard to business models. So with regard to BlackRock, what are they bringing to you that you can't do on your own? Is it simply balance sheet? And then moreover, what exactly are you sort of purporting to do with regard to pursuing the refracs? Are you underwriting the cost of the refracs? Who are you targeting, et cetera? And then secondly, more broadly speaking, in terms of that – the evolution of your business model, are you willing to put your balance sheet to work and make use of your robust holistic value proposition with regard to underwriting the cost of drilling and completing a well, even a new well?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, Bill, (41:23) questions in there. Let me try to synthesize an answer sort of one at a time. Think about what a service company brings to the table is sort of the people, process and technology. And what we're looking for is sort of revenues and margins today. What a BlackRock brings to the table is they're looking for an income tail that goes out a number of years. So in my view, it sort of dovetails together very nicely. To specifically answer your question, yes, we believe in our technology, we believe in the refrac market going forward, and we believe that we can make a difference. And so we would leverage our balance sheet to ramp that part of the business up. But what BlackRock gives us is an ability to lever beyond that, look at additional ways of doing business with our customers, different business models, push beyond where we have been today or where we might be going in the future. But we're not going to lay those out for you here on the call because I think those discussions are going to be with specific customers in specific circumstances and will remain confidential between us.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Okay. And who are – what type of customer are you targeting? I mean, it's not, I would assume, just the E&Ps under duress, but who else are we targeting?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No, we're not targeting marginal assets here. We're targeting good sets of assets that for whatever reasons are not being able to get accessed by our customer base today.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes, I want to reiterate great quarter, especially with regard to those international profit margins. I'm curious as to your opinion on when the domestic industry could see some friction in rehiring labor if this recovery gains momentum. I realize that you're in a great position given that you're one of the very few companies that actually has the ability to carry extra labor and extra costs today. So the question for you is really, at what rig count do you think you could see competitors become more aggressive in trying to steal your employees simply because there's a dearth of quality labor on the sidelines?
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Yeah, I mean, that's probably less of a rig count question, more of a capacity question as things start to tighten. And I think we've demonstrated through the last cycle, our ability to ramp up very quickly with people. So not particularly concerned about that.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): For the industry, more broadly though, do you think it would happen this cycle at a lower rig count relative to the past, because – given the service intensity trends?
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Well, I think tightness could occur at a lower rig count most certainly, and I think that the lack of investment in the industry today could drive that tightness at a lower rig count.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And do you think the equipment burn rate is going to be an issue before labor or vice versa?
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: I think the equipment precedes labor.
Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes. Good morning. Just a follow-up to the prior question there. In one of your earlier comments, you mentioned that industry capacity for frac are fully (44:50) 40% or 50% excess at the moment. But when you factor in the (44:56) perspective, the attrition, what would you say the net effective excess capacity in the marketplace might be?
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: I think it's – Kurt, this is Jeff. I mean, it's – If you think about attrition, it's happening all of the time, but it's not necessarily apparent all of the time. And by that, I mean it's – you don't see it until there's a call on the equipment, and we really saw this last time. So as competitors consume more equipment on location to do the work, you don't feel the tightness. But as that equipment is called on for even a little bit of incremental activity, that's when it's seen. So recalculating the 50% overhang is difficult to do until there's a call on it, but we're certain that it's happening today.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then for my follow-up, Christian was mentioning some continued pricing pressures or lingering effects of pricing pressures going out into the fourth quarter. Just wondered if you might be able to give us some general sense, are the pricing pressures going to be roughly equivalent in North America and international? I would be under the impression that the pricing elements would have largely abated during the third quarter if rig count's going to stabilize. Just give us some more color on pricing dynamics on a regional basis, that'd be helpful.
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Well, I think pricing internationally, all the customers ask for discounts, but the reality is there's not much to give. We never recovered from the 2008 cycle internationally. And so the better discussion there – and it moves to this discussion – is around how to deliver better efficiency and reduce costs, and that leverages precisely what we do at Halliburton. North America, as we've said, we see the price decline rate, maybe a description, decelerating, but nevertheless, still some pressure as we move through the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering & Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I guess I'm curious to hear how the last few weeks have impacted the customer discussions, whether it'd be – I mean, I imagine it's mostly focused on North America, but it did feel like completion activity was finding a floor and then the oil price rug gets pulled out from everyone. So I'm just curious how the – your view around the third quarter has evolved over the last three weeks.
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Well, over the last three weeks, it hasn't changed that much. I mean, we think about the rig count, it has puts and takes. And so it was seeing some improvement, but then Friday, I suppose those gains were erased. So I would describe where we are today as scraping along a bottom. And scraping along a bottom means that we don't anticipate dramatic change of any sort, certainly over the very near term.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: My follow-up just on the profit pressures in North America. Should we expect Halliburton's North American business in Q3 to stay profitable?
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Most certainly.
Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer: Right. So, obviously, there's still uncertainty on the depth and length of the cycle. However, we are doing everything possible to make sure that our North America will be profitable.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, all.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Boyd. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thanks. So, a lot of focus on the attrition rate in pumping this call, but how about on the demand side? You mentioned that you're seeing the average job size increase significantly year-over-year. How should we think about sort of the pressure pumping intensity of the rig count? Is there a rule of thumb that we should think about? And how is that changing?
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Well, the demand for equipment and the – the increasing demand on equipment is really a function of the increasing job sizes. And so we see more and more of the capital spend on completions, and I don't see anything that dials that back. Obviously, technology that we deliver is focused on making better wells sort of within the current job sizes. So I don't think job size growth is not infinite because it starts to have an impact on neighboring wells and other things, but the quality of the fracs will continue to improve.
Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I guess, said another way though, if you think about the job sizes increasing, is there something that we could tie to a rig count? I know the rule of thumb used to be sort of four or five rigs per pressure pumping crew. Is it something lower than that today that you're experiencing in your fleet? Or are the increased efficiencies that you're able to realize offsetting that?
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Well, I would think more in terms of well count than rig count today driving completions. And from our perspective, the basis for the Q10 and Frac of the Future is for us to be able to do that, which we are doing with substantially less capital on location. So that's clearly part of our competitive advantage.
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, and I would say just one additional thing is although the rig count has been decimated this year, the rigs that are running today, keep in mind, are the most efficient rigs that are out there. And therefore, they are drilling more wells sort of per rig than we've ever had in the past. So I think the fixation on rig count, yes, it's important to the industry, but I think well count is another thing that folks need to look at and concentrate more on, because it's the well count that ultimately drives how much completion work is done.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Brad Handler from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Bradley P. Handler - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Hey, guys. Maybe first question relating to the international activity. There were some references, maybe several references particularly in Europe/CIS/Africa, related to product sales. Should we read anything into that? Is it – was there a bit of catch-up from buyers that weren't buying, say, in the fourth quarter of last year in the downturn? But was there some sort of truing up to a normalized level? And I guess what I'm hinting at is perhaps there's some falloff as guys have caught up a little bit in their product purchases – as your customers have caught up in their product purchases. Does that undermine the third quarter outlook at all?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: No. I think what we're trying to say, service work is fairly consistent and fairly predictable, product sales sort of come lumpy all the time. And so when you get a product sale, it might push your margin and revenues up or down, but I wouldn't – other than sort of a fourth quarter push around Landmark and things like that, product sales do happen throughout the year. We just like to be transparent and point out when they've helped. But they're going to help nearly every quarter. But it just depends on sort of what the location is, what the geography is and perhaps, in some cases, what the product line is.
Bradley P. Handler - Jefferies LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Unrelated follow-up, maybe it's my – I'm not that strong in the accounting side and I don't want this to devolve to an accounting lesson, but I was a little surprised to see the stoppage of depreciation without things getting pulled into some sort of a discontinued state as the assets were held for sale. Does that happen or what's the trigger point for the businesses to be pulled out and put into a discontinued state?
Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer: Right. So, Brad, obviously, don't want just an accounting lesson, but accounting standards...
Bradley P. Handler - Jefferies LLC: Right.
Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer: ...call for a business that planned to be divested to be classified as assets held for sale when they meet certain criteria, and we met those, those are – there are six conditions. To be reported as a discontinued operation, well, you have to put the results of that business in a separate line item, that business needs to represent a strategic shift by the company, and that's what the accounting standards require. And clearly, this is not the case in this situation because we will continue to be in those businesses for drilling services and drill bits. So our treatment is consistent with other merger situations that require a sale of overlapping businesses.
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Rob Mackenzie from IBERIA Capital. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC: Thank you. A quick question for you. Coming back to the North American margin impact, commenting about 300 basis points, 400 basis points of excess cost you're bearing, I guess I'm a little bit curious with your viewpoint for a muted recovery and uncertainty well into 2016. Why carry so much incremental cost here?
David J. Lesar - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's pretty simple. I mean, I think we have a superior delivery platform in North America. We know where we are going to be adding a tremendous number of people and assets to it, and in my view, it'd be crazy to get rid of it. If you look historically, the cost to carry something ultimately outweighs the cost to have to replace it, go out and get people, retrain those people, rebuild your infrastructure and all of that. So it's a decision I made. It's on me if you disagree with it, but I think that it's easily defendable and I think it's certainly the way we need to go here, and I'd tell you, it's going to pay off once we get this deal done.
Rob J. MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital Partners LLC: Great. Thanks, Dave. And then on the international margin (54:51) this quarter obviously up sequentially, I guess, in every geomarket. I get you're guiding that down slightly again going into Q3. Can you give us a little more color on the Q2 performance? Obviously, some of that was the contract status in Brazil and elsewhere, but it seems like there's a fair bit of cost cutting that went into that, that should carry forward, correct?
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Yes. The – I mean, the Eastern Hemisphere team and international group's absolutely executing, and executing on the strategy we laid out, which is to manage costs over the near term, and they have done that, taking out quite a bit of costs, while at the same time, looking through the cycle. And we like the contracts that we've won and we've got some very strategic wins that are continuing to go on in places like Scotland and Brazil and other places. So it's just really just execution, world-class execution in the international business.
Christian A. Garcia - Senior Vice President-Finance & Acting Chief Financial Officer: But if I can add to that, in terms of our outlook, our Eastern Hemisphere margins were 19% in the second quarter and we are expecting this to come down a little bit into the upper teens. This would then suggest that our margins are being sustained at a higher level than what they were in the first quarter.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.
Jeffrey A. Miller - President, Director & Chief Health, Safety and Environment Officer: Thanks, Danielle. And I'd like to wrap up the call with just a couple of comments. First, there's no question that this is a tough market. In markets like this, Halliburton's operational execution becomes an even more valuable source of differentiation, which was demonstrated by our second quarter results. I'm confident that our team will stay dead focused on delivering both best in class service quality, along with our long-term strategies in deepwater, unconventionals and mature fields. Secondly, we're pleased with the progress of the Baker Hughes acquisition on many fronts, including the regulatory process and the divestitures. We are confident that we can achieve the cost synergies of nearly $2 billion independent of the current market related actions by either company and are excited about closing the acquisition. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Danielle, please close the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-04-20 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Kelly Youngblood - VP, IR Christian Garcia - Acting CFO Jeff Miller - President Mark McCollum - Chief Integration Officer
Analysts: Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities Angie Sedita - UBS Scott Gruber - Citi James West - Evercore ISI  Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company Brad Handler - Jefferies & Co. David Anderson - Barclays Capital Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley Dan Boyd - BMO Capital Markets 
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Halliburton First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Kelly Youngblood, Halliburton Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2015 conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Jeff Miller, President; Christian Garcia, Acting CFO; and Mark McCollum, Chief Integration Officer. As mentioned on our last call, due to a longstanding business commitment, Dave Lesar, Halliburton's Chairman and CEO will not be present today but will return for our second quarter call. Today Jeff will be providing market commentary, followed by Christian who will discuss our quarterly financial results and finally, Mark will provide an update on our progress relating to the pending Baker Hughes acquisition.  Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. Unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release which can be found on our website.  Now I’ll turn the call over to Jeff. 
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning everyone. It was a challenging quarter for the service industry which translated into lower activity levels and widespread pricing pressure on a global basis as our customers responded to the impact of reduced commodity prices. For Halliburton, total company revenue of $7.1 billion was a 4% decline compared to the first quarter of 2014 relative to a 19% decline in the worldwide rig count, once again representing industry-leading revenue performance.  Operating income declined 28% year-over-year to approximately $700 million, driven by North America and Europe/Africa/CIS. The industry experienced unprecedented decline in the North America drilling activity during the first quarter which significantly impacted our financial results. US rig count has dropped approximately 50% from the peak in late November and we’re still seeing activity fall off week to week although the pace of decline has slowed.  Looking back over the last several major cycles, the speed of this downturn has been historically high. Because of the lack of available work driven by the rig count decline and the resulting overcapacity and available equipment chasing the work that remains, this is an extremely competitive market. We’re seeing substantial pricing pressure in all of our product lines and the significant amount of service capacity is looking for work.  Service company behavior has fallen really into one of three buckets. First, those who are still running their businesses to make a profit and returns for their investors. Second, those who have decided that covering fixed cost is no longer important and therefore will take work to keep equipment busy and crews intact while operating at a loss. And third, those who are basically working at a price which covers only their cash costs. Ultimately neither model 2 or 3 is sustainable. And we believe capacity adjustments are likely in a market like this.  We’re not going to call a bottom but historically it's taken rig count three quarters to move from peak to trough. Once we see activity stabilized, the healing process can begin but it takes time. Our input costs can then start to catch up with service pricing declines and our efficiency programs and well solutions can start driving margins upwards.  What is not unique about this downturn is the customer service company and supplier behavior is pretty much as you would expect. What is unique is the speed at which this is happening. We believe that the operators, vendors and service companies who deal most effectively with the velocity of this downturn will be those who profit the most when it turns. We fully expect Halliburton to be one of those winners and so will the vendors who work with us to get through it.  Outside of North America, the international markets were more resilient than the domestic market but were not immune to the impacts of the lower commodity price environment. The international rig count is down 9% from the peak last July but we’re seeing customers defer new projects, most notably in the offshore exploration markets. Due to the lower cash flows available to operators, they are more focused than ever on lowering costs and are asking the oil service companies, engineering companies and fabricators to offer solutions, including pricing concessions. We’re working with our customers to improve project economics through technology and improved operating efficiency.  As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate headwinds across all of our international regions this year with full year international spending reflecting a mid-teens reduction. We still expect Middle East/Asia to be the most stable region for the company in 2015 as recent project awards in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE and Kuwait are anticipated to move forward. However we expect Malaysia, Australia and other markets across the region to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects.  Europe/Africa/CIS is experiencing significant activity declines across the entire region with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea, Russia and Angola. In particular, the offshore markets are facing extremely challenging economics. We've already seen significant delays of exploration work in these markets with a number of pending opportunities still at risk as operators work to balance their budgets. And in Latin America, we expect lower activity levels across the region with the largest declines projected in Mexico as a result of budget constraints and Colombia where operators are sizing their programs to live within cash flows.  In addition, we anticipate lower revenue resulting from the new Venezuelan exchange rate. Given the near-term headwinds that we’re seeing globally, our focus is on controlling what's within our control. First, after taking a hard look at our global operations in the first quarter, we streamlined our business primarily through headcount and asset reductions while not impacting our service delivery model, which resulted in a $1.2 billion restructuring charge, including a complete write-off of our operations in both Libya and Yemen. Christian will provide more details later in the call.  Second, we’re continuing to work with our suppliers. As we discussed last quarter, there's a delay in realizing cost savings from our suppliers. Input cost reductions around items like sand and logistics began during the first quarter and we expect to realize more of these cost savings as we move through the remainder of the year. We’re pleased that many of our key vendors now realize the type of market that we are in and they are working with us to allow us to get our input costs more competitive. We’re also looking at consolidating our vendor list into fewer companies that we can commit more volume to going forward.  Third, we are staying focused on service execution and collaborating with our customers to reduce their well costs. Fourth, we're playing offense. We're focused on the utilization of our deployed assets and we're defending our market share with key customers. And finally and most importantly, we're still a returns driven organization and where pricing concessions were to push returns below an acceptable threshold, we have instead elected to stack equipment, including frac lease. Given the unsustainable prices, we've seen some of our competition willing to work for them who would rather save our equipment for better times.  One other thing I need to point out is that in a typical downturn we would've reduced our operating cost structure more than we have done but in anticipation of closing the Baker Hughes acquisition later this year, we want to preserve our underlying service delivery platform. We know we have best-in-class service delivery and keeping this platform in peak condition will allow us to realize our transaction synergies post close. This means that we're not cutting as deep as we might have done so otherwise. And consequently we're carrying an elevated cost structure. While this decision burdens current margins it is clearly the right thing to do in the long run.  As we’ve done in previous downturns, we are looking through the cycle and investing capital and strategic programs to maintain the health of the franchise and to position ourselves to be able to accelerate out of the downturn when the market recovers. This includes investing in key technologies and capabilities that allow us to deliver our value proposition in unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields.  As I mentioned previously, we're always working closely with customers around the world to help them lower their cost per barrel of oil equivalent. We approach this in two ways. First through more efficient and more reliable lower-cost delivery platform, and second, through technology that reduces uncertainty and makes better wells.  In terms of efficiency this is where innovations like our Frac of the Future with its increased reliability and lower-cost profile become important differentiators. Our Q-10 pumps support our surface efficiency strategy which will enable us to lower operators’ costs while at the same time protect our margins against deteriorating industry conditions. This is also where we leverage the scale of our global logistics network and supply chain.  Just as important, we’re working with our customers to help them make better wells through subsurface insight and custom chemistry. Our CoreVault system is a great example of delivering subsurface insight where we’re able to collect multiple core samples during a single trip and preserve 100% of the downhole fluid for analysis. This accelerates our customers’ reservoir understanding, more precisely locate hydrocarbons and helps them fully understand the economic value of their asset. We’re doing this today in every North American basin and have recently expanded into Europe and Asia-Pacific.  Our CYPHER seismic to stimulation service is gaining traction, helping more customers maximize the value of their unconventional assets. Our CYPHER project count actually increased sequentially even as activity levels declined. The added projects included both existing customers expanding their programs as well as customers new to the CYPHER platform.  And finally, custom chemistry where we are pleased with the expansion of AccessFrac which helps our customers efficiently and effectively stimulate the entire lateral. In addition to being used in 12 basins around the world, AccessFrac is also seeing significant uptick as a refrac solution in North America. When deploying our proprietary chemical diversion technology in the early unconventional oil wells, we’ve seen instances where the estimated ultimate recovery has more than doubled.  There has been a lot of discussion around inventory wells. Operators choosing to drill but not complete wells and then defer production until commodity prices become more favorable. Third-party estimates put this number around 4000 wells. It is our view that although inventory wells can exacerbate the short-term activity declines per completions, it essentially defers the revenue opportunity. When our customers decide to increase activity levels, this will be beneficial for Halliburton as they are likely to increase completions in tandem with new well drilling, which could accelerate our rate of recovery during the upcycle.  Now before I turn the call over to Christian, I want to spend a few minutes on the macro environment. Over the past several months, global demand expectations for 2015 have been consistently revised higher, now calling for an increase of over 1 million barrels per day, including recent upward revisions for both US and Europe.  On the supply side, we’re all watching US production levels very closely given the volume expansions that took place throughout 2013 and 2014. Recently monthly production estimates have been encouraging, however, showing significantly lower production growth and actually projecting oil production to be flat to down in the major basins.  In terms of international production, non-OPEC estimates continue to be trimmed. But we see this as an overlooked positive factor. Comparing the IEA forecast exit rate for 2015 against 2014, key non-OPEC contributors are expected to decline with further reduction expected as a result of declining global rig count. We view this as ultimately constructive for the prospect of supply-demand equilibrium. Whether we reach this point in months or quarters, Halliburton will continue to take the necessary steps to prepare our global franchise with the eventual recovery and to outperform our competitors.  Further it's our view that North America will continue to be the most adaptable market in terms of addressing well economics through both efficiency models and technology uptake. One way to look at it is that the US unconventional business is now the lowest cost fast as the market incremental barrel of oil available in the world today. One thing we’ve helped our unconventional customers prove over the years is that they are smart, technically savvy and very adaptable companies and I am confident that this type of market will show that again. As a result, we believe that when the recovery does come, North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be best positioned to lead the way.  We’ve been through these cycles before. We know what to do and we’ll execute on that experience.  Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?
Christian Garcia: Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. I will begin with an overview of our first-quarter results. Total company revenue of $7.1 billion represented a 4% decline compared to the first quarter of 2014 while operating income declined 28% to approximately $700 million.  As expected, we experienced typical first quarter sequential decline in revenue and margins due to the absence of high year-end software and product sales in the fourth quarter, as well as the normal first-quarter weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Russia and the Bakken. The decline this year was obviously exacerbated by the macro headwinds facing the industry.  Now let me compare our geographic results to the first quarter of 2014. In the Eastern Hemisphere, first-quarter revenue was essentially flat and operating income increased 3% over prior year despite activity and pricing headwinds. We’ve consistently outperformed our competitors in terms of revenue growth over the last few years and we expect that this will be true for the first quarter once all of our peers have reported.  In the Middle East, Asia region, revenue and operating income increased by 13% and 33% respectively. This excellent improvement was led by solid growth in integrated project activity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and India that was partially offset by declines in Malaysia and Australia.  Turning to Europe/Africa/ CIS, we saw first quarter revenue and operating income declined 16% and 41% respectively. Significant activity declines in Angola and the Norwegian sector of the North Sea along with currency and sanction related issues in Russia led to the lower results for the region.  Latin America revenue and operating income increased by 10% and 22% respectively, primarily due to higher unconventional drilling in Argentina and increased activity in Venezuela.  Moving to North America, revenue and operating income declined 9% and 54% respectively, relative to a 21% reduction in the US-land rig count. Lower commodity prices have translated into severe reductions in activity levels throughout the first quarter accompanied by significant price reductions. Primarily as a result of the market decline that is affecting all of our operations globally, we incurred $1.2 billion of charges in the first quarter consisting of asset write-offs, including our entire operations in Libya and Yemen, severance-related costs, inventory write-downs, impairments of intangible assets and facility closures and other items.  Over the last two quarters, we’ve reduced our headcount by approximately 9000 employees, more than 10% of our global headcount. As Jeff indicated, we're continuing to take a hard look at our operations. Additional actions will likely be required in the second quarter although we expect further charges will be significantly smaller.  Our corporate and other expenses totaled $69 million for the quarter, slightly lower than originally anticipated. We estimate that our corporate expenses for the second quarter will be approximately $75 million and this will be the new quarterly run rate for 2015.  During the quarter, we adopted the new free-floating market exchange rate in Venezuela, resulting in an approximate $200 million foreign-currency loss. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter came in slightly lower than expected at 26% due to a higher mix of international earnings and other favorable tax benefits. For the second quarter we’re expecting the effective tax rate to remain at approximately 26%.  For capital expenditures, given the severity of the decline in activity levels, we are now reducing our capital spend for the year by $500 million or approximately 15% to $2.8 billion. Because we manufacture our owned equipment, we have the utmost flexibility to adjust our capital spend based on our visibility of the market.  Our objective is to look beyond the cycle and we continue to be committed to investing in certain strategic technologies such as the Frac of the Future while retiring older more costly equipment. Our rollout strategy related to this initiative is not impacted as a result of our new capital guidance and therefore we still expect to be approximately 50% converted to the Frac of the Future by year-end.  Finally, let me give you some comments on our second-quarter operational outlook. In North America, the average US rig count for the second quarter is already down nearly 30% compared to the first quarter and we expect further activity declines and for pricing to remain under pressure. As a result, we anticipate a sequential revenue decline in the second quarter. But as a reminder, we typically outpace changes in the average rig count.  We also expect margins to drift lower to the mid single digits with our sequential decrementals improving compared to the first quarter as we begin to see the impact of our cost reduction initiatives and lower input costs from our suppliers.  Now moving to the Eastern Hemisphere outlook. In the second quarter, we are anticipating both revenue and margins to be in line with the first-quarter levels, as the typical seasonal improvements are expected to be offset by customer budget reductions and pricing concessions.  In Latin America, for the second quarter we expect a revenue decline in the upper teens with low double-digit margins. The main driver of this is our Venezuela operations where revenues are expected to decline by 50% sequentially as a result of the recent currency devaluation. In addition, we expect to see budget constraints in Mexico and reduced activity in Brazil and Colombia.  Now I will turn the call over to Mark for an update on the pending Baker acquisition. Mark?
Mark McCollum: Thanks, Christian and good morning. It’s good to be back on the call and I am excited to be able to provide you with an update on the significant progress we’re making towards closing the Baker Hughes acquisition.  Let me begin with some of the more recent developments. On March 27, we announced that the transaction was approved by the shareholders of both Halliburton and Baker Hughes. We were pleased that nearly 99% of the shares voted at Halliburton Special Meeting voted in favor of the proposal and that more than 98% of the shares voted at Baker Hughes special meeting voted in favor of the transaction. These results were strong vote of confidence from our shareholders and we believe reflect their enthusiasm for the strategic and financial merits of the combination. When we announced the transaction last November, we discussed the likelihood of divestitures and our confidence that the combination would be achievable from a regulatory standpoint.  On April 7, we announced that we will be marketing for sale our Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling, logging while drilling and measurement while drilling businesses. The 2014 revenue associated with these businesses was approximately $3.5 billion. We're very pleased with the strong interest that’s been expressed in these assets by potential buyers both within the energy industry as well as outside the industry, including a number of very capable financial sponsors. We will begin the marketing process in the coming weeks. The eventual sale of these businesses is subject to obtaining final approval of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition by the competition authorities reviewing the transaction.  We expect there will likely be additional divestitures and we plan to provide updates at the appropriate time. However launching the sale of the drill bits and drilling businesses is a good first step toward expediting this process. We're continuing to respond to the second information request from the Department of Justice and outside of the US we continue to make progress with the required filings with the competition authorities in foreign jurisdictions. We believe we remain on track to complete the transaction late in the second half of 2015.  Now turning to integration planning. Since launching the process in early December, we’ve been focused on developing a comprehensive, detailed and thoughtful integration plan to make the post-closing transition as seamless, efficient and productive as possible but also to fully capture the financial and strategic benefits of the combination. Working in parallel with the Baker Hughes integration team, we're bringing together the talent and expertise of both companies to build an even stronger combined organization as well as ensure that the planning efforts results in a robust integration plan for each and every functional and operational area of both businesses.  We’re preparing such that on day one after the close, we can immediately begin the integration and start capturing the value inherent in this combination and deliver on the estimated synergies. Regardless of market conditions and the actions both we and Baker Hughes have taken to date, we continue to target annual pre-tax cost synergies of nearly $2 billion. As we evaluate this transaction and move toward completion, we are confident that we can achieve our synergy objective.  In closing, we remain enthusiastic about and fully committed to closing this compelling transaction. We’re very excited about the benefits this combination will provide to the shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. This combination will create a bellwether global oilfield services company and together with Baker Hughes we will combine our highly complementary suites of products and services into a comprehensive offering that will deliver an unsurpassed depth and breadth of solutions to our customers.  Now I’d like to turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing remarks. 
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Mark. To sum it up, I want to thank the Halliburton team for avoiding distractions and maintaining their focus during the downturn. We’re excited about the pending Baker acquisition. We’re making great progress and believe we’re on track to close late in the second half of this year.  It's a tough market out there and we’re not going to try to call a recovery. There are just not enough convincing data points out there at this time for me to make a conclusion. Instead we’re focused on the things we can control, things like rightsizing the business to current activity levels, preparing for the Baker integration by preserving our service delivery platform, collaborating with our customers to address their well costs, protecting market share with key customers, to turning down work when baseline economic thresholds don't make sense. Continuing to work with our supply chain to properly adjust costs to current market conditions, we made progress here but there's still more to get. And finally investing to preserve the long-term value of the franchise.  So whatever scenario you think may happen, we have the people, technology and experience to outperform the market. We demonstrated this during previous cycles and have no reason to believe that this cycle will be any different.  Now let’s open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. 
Jud Bailey : Good job on the quarter, impressive. A question on international, impressive performance in the margins better than what we were anticipating and as well as the second quarter guide. Could you give us a little insight, Jeff, as to what’s helping drive the margin performance there and help us think about going forward, are you seeing the impact of some of the pricing concessions in the 1 and 2Q margins internationally?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Jud. I am pleased as well with the results in the international market for us and I think it reflects a systematic buildout that we have been talking about in terms of strengthening that organization and it's really paying off. It also demonstrates execution of our mature field strategy which is really inherent in a lot of that activity. So I think it's consistent with our performance over the last couple of years and I expect to continue to outperform there. As we look at pricing, though, there is pricing pressures sort of throughout the marketplace and obviously the international markets are not immune to that. 
Jud Bailey : And then my follow-up is going to be on North America. You obviously comment on the second quarter for margins but can you help us think a little bit further maybe in the back half of the year? You noted in the release, you’re going to carry higher costs as you anticipate closing of the Baker transaction. Can you help us think about the impact on margins, maybe in the back half of the year as you carry higher cost than you would've anticipated against the market dynamics as price is going to be pretty tough in the back half of the year?
Christian Garcia: Jud, this is Christian. Let me take that. So you have two questions, one is what happens to North America margins in the second half of the year. We’re not going to provide guidance as Jeff talked about in his prepared remarks, the healing process starts when activity stabilizes and then pricing stabilizes, and then we will see the benefits of the adjustments in cost structure that we have taken. So don't know what it is but really it’s a guess on when activity stabilizes.  In terms of the service delivery platform, the costs that we are keeping in anticipation of the Baker acquisition, first of all, those costs that we are keeping are global in nature but it is certainly more impactful to North America. There are several examples of those buckets of costs. One is our footprint. We operate in about 20 districts in North America and with that type of downturn that we’re seeing – as severe as we are seeing, we would consider consolidating some of them.  The other one is management of organizations. So we have a management layer between the districts and the areas. We would probably have considered collapsing them. And the third, as you know we've been building our logistics capability in the last few years, sand plants where we have transloading facilities in all of the basins, or rail car network, we would have probably dismantled portions of it as activity declined. However we are keeping all of those because we're expecting the increased volumes from Baker and in terms of the margin impact of this, I can say it would probably range between 200 to 300 basis points. 
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS.
Angie Sedita : Congrats on a good quarter. Mark, I thought it was impressive, your comments on the Baker deal as far as the $2 billion in synergies. I would have thought with the pressure on revenues that the $2 billion in synergies could have moved a bit but can you talk about that a little bit as well as the accretion timeline? Has that changed at all in your mind?
Mark McCollum: So I will address the last question first, Angie. The accretion timeline hasn’t adjusted. Obviously everything is contingent on us getting the transaction closed. We can’t get after any of the integration actions until the closing happens. But I think to address your first question, there are couple things to note. First of all, we continue to target internally as synergy cases beyond the two, I mean in order to achieve it, you’ve got to reach high and so we're looking at every single thing that we could go after. That's why we remain confident.  In the downturn itself, certainly there are actions that are being taken both by Halliburton and Baker Hughes that impact employee counts, facility closures and lot of other things, some of which you would say likely would be something that would be in the synergy case itself. But the differences is that most of these changes are being done in response to the market downturn, and the question ultimately comes to, okay, when the market comes back, what happens to those costs, in order for the synergy case to be ultimately captured, we’ve got to make process changes, procedural changes, changes in the way that we do business between the two companies that ultimately captures those synergies, so that when the business does come back, the cost associated with those activities does not. And so that’s why the plans that we are making on the integration continue to really drive after the fundamental process and procedural changes behind it to make sure that we secure those synergies, not just for the current period but forever. 
Angie Sedita : And then along with that as far as the follow up, the cash from the asset sales related to the merger, is the first priority still buying back stock or has that priority changed?
Christian Garcia: Really nothing has changed, Angie. The magnitude of the buyback will always be dependent on how much cash we generate during this downturn, the proceeds from the divestitures and so forth. But our priority has not changed. 
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Gruber from Citi. 
Scott Gruber : There has been a lot of discussion recently on this refract potential in the US; you mentioned it, Schlumberger mentioned it. I am curious as to your take on the overall potential, is this really a marginal source of incremental demand where we’re just looking for a silver lining given the overall activity reductions or could this really be a material source of incremental frac demand here and is this trend primarily technology driven or is it being more driven by your customers responding to the cyclical downturn?
Jeff Miller: Hi Scott, the refrac economics are attractive both for our clients and certainly for Halliburton. We’ve been refracking in essence for a couple of years and we actually see this as a natural extension with the maturing of unconventional wells over time. Our Halliburton technology was designed specifically to address better production which includes how to refrac, so our diversion technology around AccessFrac does that spectacularly as well as CYPHER was designed with refract in mind from the standpoint of not only at the well level but also identifying candidates at a field level. I would say what has changed in terms of giving it energy right now, more energy is the current market and access to capital. So I think those are going together. I do believe we will see growth there, and I think that growth will be great for Halliburton. 
Scott Gruber : And then an unrelated follow up, one of the primary debates amongst investors currently is recovery potential. You mentioned the responsiveness of shales to an improvement in commodity price. How do you think about the potential for your North American revenues to return toward a 2014 level? Is this an unreasonable assumption on a multiyear basis, how do you think about the potential for your international revenues to rebound to that same 2014 type level?
Jeff Miller: Well, look, the North America market is again one of the most adaptable markets and we expect that, that kind of growth and improvement will be acting as the swing producer. And so I see the potential over time as we described the past recovery being sort of activity stabilizes, then pricing and then input costs catch up but overall the ability for North America to expand is certainly there and if we kind of look back it served us intensity in North America. If we go back to 2008, our rig counts arguably flat with 2014 today but our revenues over that same period of time have doubled. So I expect that the focus on making better wells which is right in our wheelhouse will continue to be important. 
Operator: And your next question comes from James West from Evercore ISI Group. 
James West : Mark, quick question for you on the divestitures. Obviously you’re going to be marketing these assets very soon. Was curious, so one, how you think about achieving kind of maximum value given these are very high quality assets that are all for grabs now? And then two, how quickly do you think we or the market will hear about who the likely buyers are of these assets?
Mark McCollum: Those are great questions, James. Obviously in this kind of a market, you’re always a little worried about the process but we've been really excited as I said in my prepared remarks about the level of interest that’s been shown in these assets. I mean these types of assets only come on the market once in a generation. And so we’ve just had a tremendous outpouring of response to very quality potential buyers both what you consider strategic buyers inside the industry, outside the industry, global-based as well as very capable financial sponsors have looked at it. We’re going to run a process for each business for the two – or for the ones that have been announced, we will run two separate processes. We will run a process over the top of them, in case there are buyers that are interested in all of the businesses in combination but we think by doing it in that way, that gives adequate and complete opportunity for anybody who is interested and participate and to come and to stake their claim.  The process for themselves generally will stretch, I am going to guess about five months. So it’s going to be in the later part of the summer before that we will probably have identified buyers. Before we can really make any kind of analysis, we’re going to have to go back to have conversations with Department of Justice and other competition authorities who are looking at this to make sure that the buyers that have been identified will be acceptable to them. Remember that the process is not just divestiture for the sake of getting proceeds. The process here is to make sure that we’re maintaining competition in the marketplace and so they'll have an interest in making sure that the identified buyers are going to be able to make sure that those businesses will be sustainable in the marketplace, will be viable competitors once the process is completed. 
James West : And then just unrelated question from me, maybe Jeff or Christian, on the supplier side, your supplier side, you’re getting some benefit, it sounds like from your sand, maybe chemicals and truck and things like that, have you seen the full benefit yet and will that show up in the second quarter? And what’s the magnitude of kind of the reduction in the cost from your major suppliers?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, James. I am not going to talk about the amount, lot of those discussions are ongoing but we are making progress. I would – discounts are still better the closer that they are to the wellhead and by that means they have better visibility of really what the full impact of the current downturn might look like. As we work with our suppliers, we’re clearly consolidating those suppliers and we’re doing more volume and we will continue to do more volume with the vendors that work with us to lower our costs. 
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company.
Bill Herbert : Mark, the divestiture process once again. Are you able to shed any light as to what the after-tax consequences will be associated with the sale of these businesses? Should there be a tax burden associated with the sale of these businesses or how do you think about that? I mean it’s contingent upon price of course but I'm curious as to what we could expect from an after-tax standpoint not on number specifically but conceptually?
Mark McCollum: Conceptually, yes. There will be an after-tax impact of these as they are -- we do expect them to sell well above book value. And so there will be a tax consequence of that. We don't know what that's going to be at this point in time, even if I did, not sure I would tell you – I would have to kill you. That is just joking but I think that – but we do expect these businesses to go for a really good value. I mean I think anyone who is interested is going to have to bring their A game, considering how many people are interested in these projects and so they are going to be pretty traditional asset sales that will have an after-tax impact themselves. But I think at this point in time we still fundamentally believe in economics of the transaction as we outlined, if you know, at the time that we announced the overall deal. We believe that's intact and our view is that there will be adequate proceeds to be able to have cash at the closing to help Christian do what he needs to do. 
Bill Herbert : And then secondly, Jeff, with regard to the inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells, are you getting any visibility from customers with regard to telegraphing when they’re going to start monetizing these wells? Are there any discussions about them getting going in the second half of the year or what pricing thresholds they are contemplating that will result in the greenlight going off?
Jeff Miller: I mean they lack the clarity in terms of the outlook as much as sort of anyone does in the market right now. So I don't think they’ve even concluded around the timing, though it would certainly be at a point in time that they see commodity prices rising as opposed to where they are. And I think around the dock inventory, of course a couple of comments. First, it represents we think about 4000 wells, that’s against the backdrop of 55,000 wells that were drilled last year. So that's one thought. And then the second is, it’s really a limited subset of customers that can even afford to talk about drilled but uncompleted wells at least as a practice. So from our standpoint, without precision around the timing it certainly looks like deferred revenue for Halliburton and arguably when it occurs it will accelerate sort of tightening and recovery. 
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Brad Handler from Jefferies & Co.
Brad Handler : Thanks guys. Maybe a couple of related questions, related to the North American market. But just first your guidance, want to make sure I heard that. I think you said mid-single-digit North American margins in 2Q that's despite not having a couple or more hundred basis points relative to cost savings and that's include – but you’re factoring in effective pricing is continuing to presumably be full quarter worth of pricing declines and the like. So first of all, I guess, is the mid single digit, did we hear that correctly?
Christian Garcia: That is correct. So Brad, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, activity continues to decline, price continues to be under pressure and therefore margins go flock down to the mid-single-digits. So it’s an all-in including the elevated cost structure that we have.
Brad Handler : Can you maybe just comment a little bit on, in Q1 maybe order of magnitude activity versus price realization combined for that minus 25% sequential performance, can you split it up for us a little bit?
Christian Garcia: So just in terms of activity versus price, if you just look at the progression of our results in the first quarter, January held up actually better than the March as you can expect, the exit rate was much weaker than where we started. Overall in terms of our activity that our frac stage count is actually down just in the mid-single digits. That would imply that this tremendous amount of pricing that we were impacted by. So we think it as we go into Q2, the activity will continue to come down. Don't know what it might be, as I pointed out, right now rig count is down about 30% and the decline continues. But we will continue to have pricing pressure.
Jeff Miller: Maybe just a follow-up as well, so clients are really myopic on price right now and as data points are continuing to deteriorate, we obviously also talk about the falling rig count, service capacity sorting itself out. But at this point in time as I said in my prepared remarks, simply don't believe that this is sustainable in terms of pricing. And so it's a point as service capacity sorts itself out we clearly expect clients to return to making better wells which is right in our wheelhouse. 
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from David Anderson from Barclays. 
David Anderson : Jeff, you talked about two of the three camps of service companies out there based on unsustainable models. And as we think about kind of the new equilibrium performance for the rig count, we know there’s going to be a lot of excess capacity. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how you think about attrition levels in the pressure pumping market? I mean how long can these guys continue working – do you think they are weighing on capital infusions there and I guess I am also just kind of secondarily wondering how you think about normalized margins in North America going forward? Do you think that it could be lower than the past just to keep those guys on the sideline? Just kind of curious how you are thinking about this as it develops?
Jeff Miller: Let me reframe that a little bit and think in terms of sort of capacity in general. If we look back before we look ahead, capacity comes out pretty quickly and actually when it comes out it doesn't generally get back to work. And that is – and so if we look at the activity today and how hard the equipment is working to the extent that equipment is getting burned up at prices that don't make sense and new capital is not spent to replace it. Then it’s not necessarily a linear attrition of equipment. What happens is it sits on the sidelines until it's needed and then it's not there, and we really saw that happen last year when capacity was taken up very quickly. And so I don't expect it to be any different going forward, which is really underpins our investment in the Q-10 and our ability to operate more sustainably at a lower cost. 
David Anderson : And then are you thinking about kind of normalized margins yet, is it too early to be talking about that? We used to talk about kind of mid-to high 20% margin. But just wondering if you’re thinking that sort of have to be a little bit lower to keep that capital from coming back in the market, we’ve been in this just to kind of avoid this cycle we seem to be constantly in?
Jeff Miller: I don't think so. I mean the path to the 20s and beyond – I mean all of that still works, because that’s in our sort of design of service and execution model, but because things are so myopic today on price, this isn’t really the time to have – we can’t act on that meaningfully. But as Christian mentioned, as activity stabilizes then healing begins and at that point certainly pricing and input costs catch-up and we’re back on the path. But we have to get to some stabilized level of activity and that's where the efficiency model that we execute really shines it on. 
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Jim Crandell from Cowen.
Jim Crandell : Thank you. Mark, is there a scenario where in order to close the Baker Hughes deal that you also need to divest wireline, fluids, the chunk of completions, offshore cementing, maybe some stimulation vessels?
Jeff Miller: Jim, as I said in my prepared remarks, we know that there will be some additional divestitures to do. We don't exactly know what those are going to be. That’s going to be something that will be found out as we have discussions with the competition authorities both Department of Justice as well as elsewhere in the world and I just can't even speculate at this point in time what those other divestitures might be. 
Jim Crandell : Mark, if it’s all of the ones that I said, is there a level where you questioned doing the deal?
Jeff Miller: There is not a level that we question doing the deal. We still fundamentally believe in everything that we see that the level of divestitures will be substantially below the $7.5 billion threshold that was laid out in the merger agreement. So we’re still operating well within that level and no, there is not a level at this point that we would walk away from the deal. 
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead : So just wanted to get general sense, I mean guys, again over time done really well obviously on the revenue front. Just trying to get a sense on the dynamics internationally from pricing and on the margin dynamic, the decrementals from here and when you might start to see some stabilization in the international markets?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Kurt. The international markets are very competitive and at this point all our clients are asking for discounts. The reality is there’s just not a lot to give. If we go back to 2008 that international markets really never recovered certainly entirely from that. But the short answer is yes we are seeing pricing pressure. Clients are asking for discounts. Though what I would say a better leading edge discussion is around efficiency and contracting which is how to better work with Halliburton to take system costs out of drilling. And so I would say we’re not having – at the beginning of those discussions were truly internationally, that's a key component of the path forward to for our customers. 
Christian Garcia: And Kurt, let me comment on international decrementals. We’re still targeting that our decrementals international to be better than in 2009. And one of the reasons why we feel that way is because of how our margins behaved in Q1. As you know, internationally our decrementals usually are the harshest in the first quarter. Historically it’s 45% plus but if you look at our Q1 decrementals it was half that historic rate. Plus we have strong incrementals on a year-on- year basis, growth in both revenue and operating income international. So every quarter is going to be a battle but we’re starting -- where we stand right now in terms of achieving the objective of having lower decrementals than in 2009. 
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer : Christian, just give a little bit more – shed a little bit more light on the $1.2 billion charges. You mentioned [indiscernible] and how much was the working capital?
Christian Garcia: Ole, we couldn’t hear you but I think you are looking for the savings from the charge. Okay, so let me just take a stab at that. We are taking multiple actions, including right-sizing our infrastructure, we reduced our headcount and lowering our supplier costs and obviously this has been a global effort. Right now our estimate for the savings from these actions is about $1 billion annually but as Jeff pointed out that and as I pointed out in the prepared remarks, we’re not done. We will continue to take a hard look at our operations in the second quarter and we will continue to make adjustments. 
Operator: Thank you. And your next question comes from Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets.
Dan Boyd : Hi, thanks. Just wanted to really clarify something because there's a lot of talk of the backlog of wells building up that you mentioned. But then at the same time you mentioned that your frac stages were only down -- what was that -- mid single digits sequentially but the rig count was down 27% sequentially. So can you help me understand what's going on there? Are you just gaining that much market share or is the backlog of wells not all that abnormally high?
Jeff Miller : Well, there's always some level of uncompleted wells in any market because of pad drilling. So if you kind of look at the numbers of pads, generally speaking, the rigs will drive uncompleted wells sort of systematically into the marketplace. So but we typically see a flight to quality in a market like this and so as we've said we are defending our customer base. We focus on the fairway players and particularly those players that value our efficiency model. As I've said we won't work at silly prices but our strategy to be the sustainable lowest-cost per barrel of oil operator holds true. And I think we're seeing it play out.
Dan Boyd : Yes, impressive market share gains. And then you've touched on this a number of times in the call, and just talking about industry attrition and pressure pumping equipment and yet it happens typically through cannibalization of the fleets I think as you touched on. But can you just maybe give us a guess as to how much attrition we might expect if we stayed at current market levels?
Jeff Miller : It's really too early in the cycle for me to give you a number, but let's think about it this way. While the total market volumes of pumping are down year on year or certainly sequentially are down, the volume per well is up 12% sequentially, which means that the equipment that's out there is working harder than it's ever worked. There may be less of it working but working harder, which says that stacked equipment does get cannibalized unless people are making capital investments in equipment. So I think we're going to see a similar attrition sort of behavior that we saw through the last cycle. End of Q&A
Operator: Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.
Jeff Miller : Thank you Danielle. I guess I'd like to wrap up the call with just a couple of comments. As we've said while we work through the current market, we'll continue to control costs to protect our margins while playing offense to protect our market position with key clients. As we look through the cycle we'll continue to invest in those capabilities to deliver our long-term strategies in unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. I'm confident that our people, technology and experience will outperform the market and emerge as we have in the past a stronger company in the recovery. So look forward to speaking with you next quarter.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Halliburton’s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Kelly Youngblood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Kelly Youngblood: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2014 conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and a replay would be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Christian Garcia, Acting CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter press release which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of restructuring charges and Baker Hughes’ acquisition related cost taken in the fourth quarter of 2014. In our prepared remarks today Dave will provide a brief update on our progress related to the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. However, the purpose of the call today is to review our quarterly financial and operational results and our outlook for 2015. We ask that you please keep your questions focused on those matters.  Now I’ll turn the call over to Dave. Dave.
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Kelly and good morning everyone. While the market is certainly tougher out there today, and I will discuss that in a minute, I do want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2014. First, I'm very proud to say that we delivered industry leading total company revenue growth and returns in 2014. We finished the year with revenues of nearly $33 billion and operating income of $5 billion. Both of which are new records for the company. Leading the improvement was North America with revenue growth of 16% and profit growth of 23%, followed by the Eastern Hemisphere with revenue and profit growth of 10% and 12% respectively.  This was also a record year for both of our divisions, where 12 of our 13 product lines set new all-time highs. From an operating income perspective, we achieved new full year records in our Completion Tools, Multi-Chem, Drill Bits and Baroid product lines. I highlight this performance because you want to head into any industry downturn starting from an extremely strong financial and operating platform and that’s certainly is where we are performing today.  And finally during the fourth quarter we announced the definitive agreement to acquire Baker Hughes. We believe this combination will create a bellwether oilfield services company, a stronger more diverse organization with an unsurpassed depth and breadth of services.  We are excited about this transaction and the benefits it will provide the shareholders, customers and other stakeholders of both companies. Similarly, employees at all levels in both organizations are excited about creating a new industry leader and the opportunities they have is part of a larger company.  We've also heard from many of our customers who have expressed enthusiasm about the combination, those who see the broader, cost effective offerings that we will be able to provide. And especially those who are looking for a compelling alternative to their current incumbent in parts of the world or individually ourselves and Baker have only a small footprint. We are continuing to highlight for our customers the benefits that this combination will deliver to them. We have formed an integration team lead by Mark McCollum which includes representatives both companies. Mark and his team have already hit the ground running to develop a day one strategy and an ongoing integration plan which we believe will deliver the nearly $2 billion in annual cost synergies we discussed in our previous announcement. Now, I'm not naïve how hard it is to put two companies together. It’s damn hard. But you know Mark and you know his excellent track record on delivering on the commitments that he makes to you. And I'm confident that we will achieve our integration goals with him in the lead. On the regulatory front we filed the initial Form S-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are proceeding expediently with all the antitrust filings. We continue to expect that we will complete the transaction in the second half of 2015.  We look forward to realizing these strategic and financial benefits inherent in this combination to create greater value for our combined shareholders. I want to clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal through despite the current macro headwinds facing the industry. In fact, as we continue to analyze the potential value creation opportunities of the combination, we believe the transaction is even more compelling today than we when we announced it. I would also like to congratulate the Baker Hughes employees for delivering on an outstanding quarter with record financial results. This is clear evidence to me of the capabilities of this organization and their continued focus on supporting their customers during this period of transition. So all in all 2014 was a historic year for Halliburton as we stayed focused on our returns, executing on our key strategies around unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. Our strategies have worked, are working and we intend to stay the course.  Now, let me discuss what we are seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year. Later Christian will cover our fourth quarter results. Obviously, commodity pricing has dropped dramatically over the last several months with oil prices now at levels not seen since early 2009.  The North America rig count and activity levels held up with most of the fourth quarter as customers executed against the reminder of their 2014 budgets. However, over the last 60 days the U.S. land rig count has fallen by 250 rigs or close to 15%. Capital expenditure budgets from our customers remain fluid, but so far an average have been reduced 25% to 30% as they adjust their spending to operate within their cash flows in response to a continued drop in commodity prices. As a result, we expect activity declines for North America land to accelerate further in the first quarter, impacting all of the key liquids basins. What is creating even more uncertainty with the service industry is that many customers have continue to revise down their capital budgets to further capital reduction announcements. This makes is difficult to size your business in today's U.S. market, in particular, because it is such a fast moving target. So while we did not experienced price weakness during the fourth quarter, price discount discussions with customers did begin in the fourth quarter and have accelerated over the last past several weeks and price reductions are now occurring across all product lines.  Now, we expect pricing concessions to be less severe when compared to previous cycles and therefore I believe our decremental margins should be lower. That is because our margin improvement this cycle was largely driven by our focus on gaining efficiencies and getting increased labor input cost recovered more quickly, not through net pricing increases.  This up cycle did not last long enough for us to see the kinds of net pricing that would have enabled margins to recover to historically strong levels. Therefore, less pricing erosion will be needed to eventually reduce service capacity if market weakness persists.  Based on our experience in previous downturns, we expect that it will take a couple of quarters to see how the interplay of pricing declines, volume reductions and equipment efficiency deterioration plays out relative to our ability to lower labor and input cost and to right size the organization, and therefore reach an equilibrium in the market. The first quarter of any severe downturn is almost always the most challenging quarter to predict, because pricing concessions usually impact our results in real time. Volume declines can be erratic as customer’s rig plans are uncertain and can change daily. Then there is typically a delay in realizing input cost savings from our suppliers. There is two reasons for this. One, discussions with vendors are dependent on them truly believing we have a reduction in ongoing activity levels, before we can have the kinds of tough renegotiations that results in significant input cost reductions. Second, there is a timing issue as to the expenses that flow through inventory like sand, propane, chemicals and cement. It takes a while to see lower input pricing fully reflected in your average inventory cost, because you have to work off your higher priced inventory.  Next, headcount adjustments don't follow directly from pricing concession as you still need the crews to do the work. Headcount adjustments do, however, follow volume reductions. Therefore there is a lag in getting labor costs out as activity declines. And finally, the impact of a large rig count reduction on 24-hour operations and its inherent efficiency is hard to predict as customers slow down activity in many different ways. But eventually these moving parts all settle out and we reach some sort of equilibrium. In this environment, we would expect to see most of our margin degradation occurring over the first couple of quarters and more margin stability in the back half of the year. Now, in this very uncertain averment, we believe Halliburton's more efficient crews and differentiated technologies are best suited to outperform. Additionally, being aligned with the right customers, those with assets in the sweet spot of the reservoir, becomes more important as we expect to see those customers continue to work through the cycle. But we have to be real about it. The North America market is going to see volatility and pain for a few quarters. However, in this scenario I like our chances. Now, moving to international, we started to see the impact of lower commodity prices during the fourth quarter. Declining oil prices have caused our customers to reduce their budgets and defer several of their new projects, particularly around offshore exploration. In 2015, we anticipate headwinds across all of our international regions. Middle East/Asia will likely be the most resilient followed by Latin America. And finally, Europe, Africa, CIS is expected to see the sharpest decline. Let me talk about each individually. Middle East/Asia is expected to be the best performing region for the company in 2015 as recent project awards in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the UAE, and Kuwait are all anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Malaysia and Australia and other markets across the region to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects. In Latin America, we currently expect to see unconventional activity levels in Argentina continue to grow, along with the startup of our new integrated asset management project in Ecuador. However, we believe lower activity levels in Mexico and Colombia will more than offset the higher growth in these markets. Europe, Africa/CIS is expected to experience significant activity declines across the entire region with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea, Russia, and Angola. In addition, Russia and Norway also are experiencing significant currency weakness. So when you net out the international regions, we expect to see year-on-year decline. But we believe we will outperform spending predictions indicated in the third-party surveys that are out there today. Later Jeff will discuss some of the specific actions we're taking to adjust our cost structure to the market conditions. I can tell you that we will do what we have to do, we know what buttons to push and levers to pull and we will do so. I will say that, similar to previous cycles, we will protect our market share and expect to see customers focused on our highly efficient service model. As our customers struggle with cash flows, they will be very focused on optimization and gaining higher levels of efficiency and I expect that this will bode very well for Halliburton. Our management team has been through previous downturns and we intend to emerge from this cycle a much stronger company on a relative basis. During the fourth quarter we took a $129 million restructuring charge as a first step in preparing for these market changes. And as Jeff will cover in a few minutes, there is likely to be more in the first quarter. Now for competitive purposes, we're not going to lay out our detailed strategy for addressing this business environment. However, in the short-term, we're putting initiatives in place not only to temper the impact of the activity decline on our financial performance, but also to ensure that we're in an optimal position to take advantage of the market's eventual recovery. The length of any downturn is very difficult to predict, but as you know, we are in a great financial position right now with strong free cash flow. We will make adjustments as activity declines and our intention is to look beyond the cycle and continue to execute our strategic initiatives. I believe that this is the right thing to do for the health of our business over a complete business cycle. As I stated, we've been through these cycles before and we know what to do and we will execute on that experience. The bottom line, we have historically outperformed the market in North America during downturns and we have no reason to believe that this downturn will be any different. Now, let me turn it over to Christian to provide more details on our financial performance. Christian?
Christian Garcia: Thanks Dave, and good morning everyone. It has been a while but I'm glad to be back on the call and looking forward to be working with all of you again. Let me begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results and later on let me discuss our financial outlook. Total company revenue of $8.8 billion was a record quarter for Halliburton with operating income of $1.4 billion. We achieved record quarterly revenues in both of our divisions and our Middle East/Asia region set a new record for both revenue and operating income. From a product line perspective we had record revenues in the fourth quarter in Production Enhancement, Completion Tools, Drill Bits, Artificial Lift and Consulting and Project Management while new operating income records were set by Multi-Chem, Drill Bits and Landmark. North America revenue was flat sequentially in-line with the average quarterly rig count. Operating income was modestly higher over the same period despite the impact of seasonal fourth quarter, weather and holiday downtime. Fourth quarter margins benefited from the continued roll out of our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives, as well as efficiencies we're seeing from recent enhancements to our logistics network. Service pricing was stable during the fourth quarter as activity levels remained robust, but are expected to deteriorate in the coming quarters. In the Eastern Hemisphere we experienced a modest level of sequential revenue growth which resulted in a new quarterly record despite the headwinds experienced in our Europe, Africa/CIS region. Operating income came in flat compared to the third quarter. In the Middle East/Asia region revenue increased by 10% compared to the third quarter and operating income was up 29% over the same period. Our fourth quarter margins came in just under 21% as a result of seasonal year-end software and equipment sales as well as higher integrated project-related activity in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, India and Indonesia. Switching to Europe, Africa/CIS, fourth-quarter revenue and operating income declined 8% and 35% respectively compared to the prior quarter as we experienced significant reduction in activity levels in the North Sea, Russia and Angola. Declining oil prices and project economics caused our customers to reduce activity levels in the first several of their new projects. Russia and Norway results were also significantly affected by currency weakness. In Latin America revenue increased 3% sequentially while operating income declined 4% compared to the previous quarter. The revenue increase was a result of year-end software sales, increased Artificial Lift activity in Venezuela and higher activity levels across the majority of our product lines in Colombia. Operating income was negatively impacted during the quarter from mobilization costs in Brazil and budget constraints in Mexico. Now I will address some additional financial items. As a result of the market decline that has primarily impacted our international business. We incurred $129 million of restructuring charges in the fourth quarter consisting of severance-related costs as well as asset write-offs. The majority of these adjustments related to our Eastern Hemisphere business. Our corporate and other expense totaled $83 million for the quarter excluding $17 million in costs related to the Baker Hughes acquisition. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $90 million excluding acquisition-related costs and this will be the new run rate for 2015. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 27% which was lower than expected as a result of Congress approving the Federal Research and Experimentation tax credit in late December. As we go forward in 2015 we are expecting the first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 28% to 29%. Currently, we anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2015 will be essentially in-line with 2014 and expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.4 billion for the year. I know this may surprise some of you, but let me lay out our approach. As Dave mentioned, our objective is to look beyond the cycle and continue to invest in certain strategic technology such as the Frac of the Future, while retiring older, more costly equipment. As we have previously discussed, our Q-10 pumps support our surface efficiency strategy that will enable us to lower operators' costs while at the same time protect our margins against deteriorating industry conditions. As you know, we manufacture our own equipment which gives us the utmost flexibility in this market and can adjust our spend accordingly based on our visibility. Turning to our operational outlook, the severity of the activity decline in the coming quarters continues to be unclear, preventing us from providing specific guidance. But let me give you some thoughts around the first quarter of 2015. For the first quarter of 2015, our results will be subject to the same type of seasonality that you've seen in previous years. Landmark, completions and direct sales activities typically fall-off in the first quarter as those businesses benefit historically from customers' year-end budgets. Our business will also be impacted by weather-related seasonality that occurs in the Rockies, North Sea and Russia. In the first quarter of 2014 this seasonality impacted our results by approximately 22%. However, this year we believe the decline will be exacerbated by the macro headwinds currently faced by the industry. In North America, the U.S. rig count is already down 9% from the fourth quarter average and the rate of decline has accelerated in the last two weeks. We expect to see activity levels continue to drop throughout the first quarter accompanied by price reductions. As Dave mentioned, the beginning of a down cycle is typically the most challenging, but we believe that our sequential decrementals in the first quarter will be less severe than what we have previously experienced in the prior downturn. We finished 2014 in a solid financial position. We continue to have the best returns in our peer group. We reduced working capital by seven days since our Analyst Day and gave back 33% of our cash flow from operations for our shareholders in 2014. In 2015 we will continue to focus on working capital and returns and we will live within our cash flows. We will also continue to adjust our cost structure and currently anticipate that we will be incurring restructuring charges for severance and other actions that we are contemplating in the first quarter. Now I will turn the call over to Jeff for an update on our strategy. Jeff? 
Jeff Miller: Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. Today I would like to begin my comments by discussing the current market environment and what we plan to do. Although oil demand growth expectations for 2015 have weakened it is still growth. Demand is forecast to increase by an estimated 900,000 barrels per day. Keep in mind the steep decline curves are still at work. We estimate the average annual production decline rates for unconventionals in North America are in excess of 30% and much higher in some areas. Depending on the ultimate trajectory of the rig count declines and the backlog of well completions, we believe that North America crude production could begin to respond during the back half of the year. Internationally, decline rates have become more pronounced in several key markets over the last couple of years. In areas like Angola, Norway and Russia historical growth has given way to net production declines in the last year. While decline rates in markets like Mexico and India have actually accelerated. Consequently, we believe that any sustained period of under investment due to reduced operator spending could lead to an increase in commodity prices. And this largely ignores the possibility of short-term disruptions due to geopolitical issues. So, the long-term fundamentals of our business are still strong. But it is clear we are heading into an activity downturn. We can look at previous cycles for insight and while history doesn't always repeat, sometimes it rhymes. In North America, we're looking at the rig count decline relative to past downturns. After a plateau through much of the fourth quarter, the rig count has dropped sharply over the last two months and is already down 15% from early December. This trajectory is similar to both the 2001-2002 cycle and the 2008-2009 cycle. And in those cases, we experienced a rapid correction to the rig count going from peak to trough over a three quarter period. Over the past several years, we've taken key steps to reduce our underlying cost profile. Steps such as deploying Frac of the Future equipment, streamlining our field operations through Battle Red, and vertically integrating portions of our logistics network. For these reasons, we're confident that we are better prepared than our competitors to execute through this coming cycle. In the international markets, our projects and contracts tend to be longer term in nature than in North America. Historically, this has resulted in reduced year-on-year volatility. However, nearly all of our customers are currently reassessing their priorities and looking for efficiency and even more so in the offshore space. It's important to note that this group has been quick to react to decline in commodity prices with the first moves being made in mid-2014 at sub $100 oil. Although projects already underway are continuing to move forward, generally speaking we're seeing significant reductions in new work being tendered and projects that can be delayed are moving to the right. As we evaluate service intensity for our international markets, we keep a close eye on revenue per rig, which helps us understand the overall health of the business. Although this metric took a step backwards during the 2009 economic downturn, we've seen consistent improvement over the last four years. In fact, we're in a better position now than going into the last cycle. Our 2014 revenue per rig is more than 20% higher than in 2008. For Halliburton, this expansion represents not only the value of technical content in complex wells, but also our ability to expand our footprint in underserved geographies, as well as in underutilized product lines. We believe this demonstrates the success of our growth strategies, deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals, and positions us to outperform through the next cycle. As Christian said, the midterm outlook is unclear. But whether this cycle ends in a sharp V or takes time to recover, our strategy will be consistent. First things first, we'll control the things we control. We've already taken initial steps to address headcount internationally. And as activity in North America begins to fall more sharply, we will make similar adjustments here as well. Between actions already taken in the fourth quarter and actions we anticipate taking by the end of the first quarter, we expect our headcount adjustments to be in line with our primary competitors. We intend to minimize discretionary spending in our operations. As operators have requested price discussions with us, we've opened dialogues with our suppliers around both volume pricing and anticipate reducing our input cost profile. We'll continue to manufacture our Frac of the Future equipment and plan to take advantage of the opportunity to accelerate the retirement of older fleets which operate at a higher cost, especially in 24-hour operations. The value we have seen from the rollout of our Q-10 pumps has truly exceeded our original expectations. And despite the current market conditions, we feel it's the right decision for our shareholders to move forward with this initiative. Frac of the Future not only gets the job done with 25% less capital and offers maintenance savings of up to 50%, an optimized Frac of the Future spread running under the right efficiency model can complete a well more than 50% faster than legacy equipment. And it does all of this with 35% fewer people on location. Frac of the Future represents about 30% of our North American fleet today, and we expect that number to be closer to 50% by year end. Second, service quality really matters, and even more so in this environment. And our ability to execute more efficiently lowers non-productive times for our customers and reduces their effective cost per barrel. Due to the nature of the work that we do today, large complex shale wells in North America, increasingly technical offshore work and a growing base of integrated projects on the international stage, we believe that our superior execution and best-in-class technical solutions will allow us to maintain utilization and outperform our peers. As the management team, this isn't our first downturn. We're talking to our customers every day, and it's safe to say that budget expectations are a moving target. Accordingly, we've given ourselves flexibility inside of our capital budget to right size quickly to whatever the market gives us. I'm very pleased with our management team and the strategies we have in place, and believe that we're well positioned to outperform in the downturn and to ensure that we take advantage of the recovery up cycle and come out a much stronger company. Now, let me turn the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?
Dave Lesar: Thanks, Jeff. Industry prospects will continue to be weak and the coming quarters and the ultimate depth and length of this cycle remains uncertain. However, we are confident that our management team is prepared to meet the challenges that are forthcoming and we will take the opportunity to strengthen the long-term health of our franchise. We will selectively cut costs and at the same time, continue to invest where we can improve our competitive position. Whatever scenario you think may happen we have the people, technology and experience to outperform the market. We have demonstrated this to you for the past several years. Whatever the level of industry activity, we expect to get more than our share of it. Now, before I open it up to questions I want to let you know that due to other business commitments I will not be participating in our first quarter conference call. Jeff will be providing market comments on my behalf and I will return for our second quarter call. Now let's open it up for questions. 
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.
J. David Anderson: Thanks. Good morning Dave.
Dave Lesar: Good morning. Good morning Dave.
J. David Anderson: So, Dave, first off, you must be very happy to see the strong numbers posted by Baker this morning. Hopefully, they can keep it up as you close this deal by the end of the year. But as we all kind of stare out at the unknowns of the next couple quarters, I would love to hear your perspective what you've seen so far from your customers in North America. We're getting a sense this is happening a lot faster than we have seen in past downturns. Perhaps it is because E&P's are struggling with where the oil prices will settle out. I just want to know if you agree with that assessment, and perhaps you could give us some insight into their thinking and how that is shaping your view on how this market responds over the next couple quarters.
Dave Lesar: Yeah, let me let Jeff take a shot at it and then I'll comment as necessary.
Jeff Miller: Yeah, thanks, Dave. I mean the -- we're talking to our customers every day. And of course initially the discussions have been around reductions in the 25% to 30% range. However, as commodities continue to move, they are all revisiting their budgets. I mean, arguably for the next couple of quarters this will be -- North America will look a bit like a chocolate mess in terms of where it winds up. But the -- most customers are living within their cash flows and similarly, that's what we are going to do. But we're confident that we're positioned in the right places and in the fairways of the right plays to where we will be very effective as we work through this with them.
Dave Lesar: Yeah, Dave, let me just add a little bit to that. I think the -- your question about the speed of the pullback by our customers is a bit unusual and I think, first of all, they're worried about their cash flow because of lower commodity prices. And I also think they are worried about where their next dollar might come from if they start living outside of their cash flows. So, in my view, it sort of exacerbates the speed by which this is happening. But I also think it accelerate the time where they sort of know what they can spend this year, they know how they are going to spend it, they know who they are going to spend it with. And we can get to that equilibrium point that I referenced in my remarks.
David Anderson: So, now, Dave a key part of your strategy over the last several years has been aligning with the strongest customers. You clearly did that in the natural gas downturn and this is -- the same strategy here with oil. These are the customers that have the best economics in their acreage. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the steps that you think these stronger guys are taking. Are you seeing kind of high grading of drilling yet? Is it CapEx shifting amongst certain product lines? Are you starting to see them use their scale to get more pricing concessions through the supply chain? Can you just help me understand how maybe -- your customer base is clearly differentiated, how are they responding differently or are they yet?
Dave Lesar: Yeah, I think -- good question. In terms of what they are doing and we are -- let me just confirm, we are aligned with what we call the fairway players, particularly in North America. And our view of a fairway player is one who is in a strong financial position and has a low leasehold cost or are in the sweet spots of these various reservoirs. So, the discussions with them today are, okay, let's high grade back to the places where we can produce the lowest cost per BOE even in this pricing environment. Let's have to remain service company and operator, very flexible in how we're approaching this market in terms of where we're going to put rigs up, how many rigs we're going to have there. We went to partner with you in terms of the service capabilities you have. But be essentially aware that we're still in a commodity driven world and we may have to be flexible and change. We can do that. We've got a good management team, we've got a good footprint, we've got good technology and it's not a fun environment to be in, but it's one we can easily handle.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jud Bailey: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to -- you talked about how quickly your customers are moving much more quickly than in prior cycles. Could you maybe talk a little about how that's impacting your discussions -- and you talked about it a little bit -- but how it's impacting your discussions with your vendors? And maybe how quickly you think you could get price concessions? And do you think you can get price reductions on the supply chain side in-line with what you are giving to your customers?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, thank you, Jud. Those discussions have already begun, but I think as Dave referenced in his early remarks, there is a bit of a disconnect in the timing of seeing price concessions with customers and working that both through the vendor community and also through our inventory. I think that is one of the reasons I say we look out a quarter or two. That said, we've got a terrific procurement organization and we have -- we're already in discussion with a number of vendors and we continue to see this progress. Again, these are steps that we have taken before and it's really a matter of connecting sort of what's happening in the marketplace to the vendor community, but I think that happens initially quite quickly.
Jud Bailey: Okay. And then just to kind of switch gears and look internationally. And Christian commented a little bit on this, but it want to make sure I am thinking about it correctly when I think about Europe, Africa/CIS and the types of revenue declines you experienced in the fourth quarter. You take away some of the seasonality and your typical year-end product sales. Can you help us think about that market in terms of revenue progression in the first quarter or second quarter? And what are the moving parts on what's going to be the biggest weakness in that market? 
Christian Garcia: Jud let me approach it internationally in total. As I mentioned, we're not going to provide specific guidance, but kind of give you some help here. If you look at seasonal decline that we see in our international markets, it usually declines -- typically declines about 10% -- 9% to 10% for Q1. Clearly, there's going to be macro headwinds that would push that at a higher decline rate. If that is the case, then we will basically see a steeper decline in the operating income. As an example, last year we saw a 300 basis points decline from Q4 to Q1 for our international markets and we expect to see a little bit higher than that this time around. Now, I'm not going to provide guidance in any of the sort of regions, but you're absolutely right, Europe, Africa/CIS will probably have a higher decline than Middle East or Latin America.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. Your line is open.
Bill Herbert: Thanks. Good morning. Dave and Jeff and Christian, so I think it's plausible that given the rationale that you laid out that your decremental margins are going to be less severe than they were in 2009. I'm just curious if we can bracket sort of a plausible targeted range. I mean you did close to 60% decrementals in 2009, I'm just curious as to what you guys envision as a reasonable target as we come into 2015 with regard to decrementals in North America. I mean should they start with a four just to throw that out there?
Christian Garcia: Right. So, Bill, to answer you, we don’t know, because the – the reason is we don’t know the depth the length of the cycle. Okay. So what we can tell you is in Q1 if you look at 2008, 2009, the rig count drop in Q1 of 2009 was about 30%, our revenue decline was 25% of that line. 
Bill Herbert: Right.
Christian Garcia: We had the 1,000 basis points decline in Q1. We just don’t think it’s going to happen in Q1 at least given the visibility that we have currently. So that’s the only visibility we have. We are going to do it quarter by quarter and we will update our guidance as we go along throughout the year.
Bill Herbert: Okay, and then secondly more of a conceptual question for Dave. Dave, if you could put your oilfield history and cap on and compare and contrast if you will what you expect to be this downturn in terms of duration versus what we've seen kind of in 2088, 2009, the late 90s and the mid-80s. It sounds like from a duration aspect, although you guys have taken pains to say you don’t know whether this is U-shaped or V-shaped. Our capital spending budget would seem to indicate that you don’t necessarily view this as a protracted multiyear adjustment.
Dave Lesar: No. I think, Bill, that’s right. I mean, if you look at the 2008-2009 that was really a gas driven rig count decline. What we are seeing today is more of an oil based decline. If you go back into the late 80s and 90s, those actually were probably more oil driven declines at that point in time. And so I don’t have a crystal ball that will allow me to absolutely predict it. I know on my experience that you have to invent through these things. You want to keep your business franchise strong. And as Christian indicated, we are looking at basically a flat capital budget for next year. But the reality is that a lot of that is going into building out our Q-10 pump system, because, frankly, you guys can shoot me if I didn’t continue to invest in that technology. It’s a great technology. It’s a differentiated technology. It saves not only customer’s money but it saves us operating cost. So we would be crazy not to push through with the deployment of that and retire the older assets. The reality is that if we did -- we had pulled back there our capital expenses for next year likely would be going down. But generally, my experience has been stay flexible, stay nimble, stay strong financially and I think that when we come out of this thing, especially when we execute the transaction with Baker, we’re going to be a heck of a company and I'm really looking forward to that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
James West: Hey, good morning guys.
Dave Lesar: Good morning, James.
James West: Hey, Dave or Jeff, on international side, obviously, you’re going to have conversations. You are having conversations about pricing. But my sense is this cycle we never saw that big inflection point for international pricing, it was more of a market share game. So do you actually have that much pricing not to give up or am I misreading this because lot of the CapEx costs are coming offshore where pricing is better?
Jeff Miller: Thanks James. This is Jeff. No, you are reading that correctly. I mean, we really never saw net pricing throughout the last cycle internationally. In fact, as you describe most of the margin gains were volume driven and really cost absorption over that period of time. That said, we are working with our customers around efficiency approaches, how can we lower total cost of operations for them and this really gets back to our basic strategy which is around reducing uncertainty and increasing reliability in operations. And we've made terrific gains in non-productive time over the last couple of years and that’s a differentiator for us. 
James West: Is there an urgency on the part of our customer base? Are they expressing urgency for you to go ahead and get the Baker deal closed so you could provide even better efficiencies?
Dave Lesar: Yeah, I think James as Kelly said at the beginning, we really don’t want to and can't answer any questions related to Baker other than what we had in our prepared remarks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS. Your line is open.
Angie Sedita: Great. Thanks. Good morning guys. Christian, could you -- I mean you gave us the color on Q1 on international markets, as you looked at it seasonally Q4 over Q1 on a normal year. Can you do the same for us on North America?
Christian Garcia: Yeah, so North America, as I mentioned, rig count is already down 9% so far. I don’t know may reach the decline in the mid-teens for the whole quarter. Well, assuming that projection as correct, we would expect a revenue decline to probably slightly less than this -- than that percentage based on our past experience.  And as I mentioned, the decrementals in 2008-2009, we don’t think we are going to do better than that. 
Angie Sedita: Okay. Okay, fair enough. And Dave or Mark, can you talk about the steps you are taking both internationally and in North America to protect your market share given that your largest fear has been quite vocal on your proposed merger and the opportunities that they see.
Jeff Miller: Yeah, let me answer that one Angie. I have heard the word distraction, I have heard other comments about what's going to happen. You got to remember we've been asbestos, we've been through asbestos, we've been through Macondo, we've been through the Iraq war and none of those distracted us from making sure our business franchise remains strong. We've been through ups and downs, that didn’t distract us.  So, I guess, my view is, you know us. We are the execution company. We are not going to get distracted through this. This is a tough market, but we've been through these kinds of things before. I've got a really strong management team. We are going to focus on maintaining our market share. We’re going to focus on improving our business franchise and clearly we’re not going to get distracted. I'm not going to permit it to happen. So I guess that would be my sort of editorial comment on it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Market. Your line is open.
Kurt Hallead: Hey, good morning. Thanks for all that color. I just wanted to dive in a little bit deeper into Brazil, for example, given lot of challenges that are going down there with corruption scandal. I know you guys have a contract shift taking place down in Brazil. I want to get a sense as to -- you mentioned Mexico, what's your outlook for Brazil as you go into 2015?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Thanks Kurt. The outlook is, we will do those things that we've described. We expect to drilling contracts signed in first quarter. We should have our wireline contract sort of reupped in Q1 and our testing contract mobilized into Q1. The broadly outlook, however, is we still that market declining to a certain degree in terms of activity and beyond that really don’t want to give any guidance expect to say that we've described some of those markets as looking a little bit stronger and certainly Brazil and Mexico are likely to be headwinds.
Kurt Hallead: Right. And then beyond the next follow-up, say, beyond the Rouble depreciation dynamic in Russia, what kind of activity changes have you seen there?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, in Russia, I mean, obviously we still got a couple of things going on. First, the sanctions are in place and so that’s having an impact on our business, you mentioned currency. And then around mature field activity there may be some improvement there. But overall, the issues around sanctions and what not, I think, are a bit of a drag on the business overall.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Tillery with Tudor Pickering. Your line is open.
Jeff Tillery: Hey, good morning. Could you give us some color as you see on the domestic completion activity there has been increasing anecdotes around wells being drilled but not completed. Could you just talk about is that having – is that noticeable yet and how do you see that playing out over the coming quarters.
Jeff Miller: We've worked through year we saw tightening in capacity, things that I described. So there is some amount of that out there. But I would really take a broadly view to say that our customers are managing within cash flow, and so I think that behavior may be different for different customers. But broadly there will be a drawback to the best parts of the plays focused on efficiency and really those strategies that we talk about that we've built our franchise around, which is lowest cost per BOE, custom chemistry and delivering sub service insight. So I think those things are at play. But I don’t necessarily see a large inventory building of uncompleted wells.
Dave Lesar: Yeah, I think -- this is Dave. I mean, you've just got to think through -- put yourself in the operator’s mind, especially one who is concerned about cash flow. It would be crazy to drill a well and then put it in inventory because you've got cash flow out, but not cash flow coming in.  So I think the decision is very quickly going to go to, do your drill well? If you drill a well you’re going to complete it. If you’re not going to complete that there is no sense in drilling it, and that’s the dialog that’s going on now.
Jeff Tillery: My second question is unrelated. You talked a lot about -- there is lot of questions around North American supply chain, Europe, Africa, CIS, you've talked about that being likely the worst region in 2015. Could you just talk about cost structure and flexibility in that region and things you’re doing to address that?
Christian Garcia: Yeah, thanks. So we've taken some steps early in Q4 around headcount, so we are reacting quickly to what we see there. As we described the timing around supplier cost reductions and getting those in place don’t sync up perfectly. But for the visibility that we have we are taking actions to address that.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of James Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
James Wicklund: Good morning, guys. You guys always gain market share in the down market and you've done a fabulous job this morning explaining why. But I just kind of have an industry question. I remember when I was running an operation in Africa, granted it was long time ago. And I have to cut everybody by 15% and I didn’t really care what their margins were, they just had to cut their prices to me by 15%. Their margins or costs where their problem. Has that changed?  Jeff, you alluded to the fact that since we -- some of these companies don’t have the margin to give up that pricing won't go down this much?
Jeff Miller: Jim, I'm glad you are not my customer anymore. I think the reality is that you -- a customer may take that approach, say, we want to cut our cost by 15%. But in today's world and really today's shale world in the U.S. and let’s say the offshore market in Africa, differentiated technologies still make a difference. And having that technology, having the efficiency, having the people on the ground ends being sort of what you sell to that customer. Customers also know that in reality -- in reality they know who they want to use for particular products and services in various parts of the world and generally they move to make sure that when they go through a cost reduction after like this that they keep the strong players strong. 
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Waqar Syed: Thank you very much. Dave, my question relates to service intensity in the U.S. shale. You were seeing strong service intensity increase throughout last year, do you expect that trend to continue? Do you expect people to have more frac stages and then use more sand per frac stage? Or do you see that abetting with where the sand price -- sand costs are right now?
Dave Lesar: Yeah. Thanks Waqar. The behavior around the wells, we expect to continue. I mean, what we've seen is consistently improving productivity based on the things we talk about all the time, so custom chemistry, the application of your technology like AccessFrac and rock firm and then also sand volume. So, while overall activity likely falls off, the activity that’s executed is going to be executed with absolutely the best technology and well bore design and frac design to deliver the lowest cost per BOE. So I expect that continues.
Waqar Syed: And so previous you were seeing about 15% per quarter kind of change in sand volumes used per well, if I may say. How do you see that trending going forward?
Jeff Miller: Well, we actually in Q4 a year-on-year increase of about 46% sand on a per well basis, so that was up sequentially another 5% or 6%, again, on a per well basis. So, I expect that at some point better design, better frac design will moderate the volume of sand, it’s not internment. But nevertheless, I would expect the demand -- not the demand, but on a per stage basis volumes to remain high.
Dave Lesar: Yeah, and let me just make sort of one last comment on sort of increasing volumes is that, more and more of our customers are now looking at what is the impact of these large volumes jobs on offset wells. And this concept of well bashing is what's it’s called where basically pumping enormous volumes into one well bore is it bashing adjacent well bores and actually declining or decreasing the volumes you are getting out of it in total. So, I think as the volumes continue to increase, customers and the service industry, Halliburton, in particular, are starting to look at sort of the signs of what's happening down hole two to make sure that what you are running up with is an optimal outcome and not just accelerating greatly production from one well, but impacting that in adjacent wells.
Operator: That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. 
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Thank you, Kay [ph]. So I would like to wrap the call up with just a couple of comments. And as we've said there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty in the market, but we've seen this before. And we always take basically a two-pronged approach, which is first, we control what we control and defend our margins within our cash flows. And the second is that we look through the cycle and as in the past emerge a stronger company in the recovery. Thank you and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Kay [ph], you can take from there.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program, you may all disconnect. Everyone have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Halliburton’s Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Kelly Youngblood, Halliburton’s Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2014 conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and a replay would be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most direct comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of restructuring charges taken in the third quarter of 2013 and an insurance recovery and a decrease to our reserve taken during the third quarter of 2014, both of which are related to the Macondo litigation. Now I’ll turn the call over to Dave. Dave.
Dave Lesar: Thank you Kelly and good morning to everyone. I can tell you I am really pleased with our third quarter results. Even with all the noise out there this quarter and things such as Russian sanctions, disruptions in Libya and Iraq, the supply chain challenges we faced, and customer delays in the Gulf of Mexico, I believe we met these challenges head on, fought through them and we’re successful, and I am really proud of our employees who made it happen. Now here are the headlines: record company revenue of $8.7 billion. We also delivered industry leading revenue and operating income growth, both sequentially and year-over-year, once again outgrowing our peer group. New quarterly revenue records for both North America and the Eastern hemisphere with double-digit sequential revenue growing in Latin America, and one I know you are going to want to hear is that the exit rate for this quarter for North American margins was over the 20% margin mark, a major milestone in delivering our analyst day commitment to you, our shareholders. In addition, our job board in North America remained sold out and we are delivering new stimulation equipment that will allow us to add incremental work in the fourth quarter with no negative impact on our margins. We believe the Macondo case is an essentially over for Halliburton, based on our settlement in the judge’s ruling in the litigation. And lastly, we continue to focus on delivering higher shareholder returns to you. This quarter, we repurchased an additional $300 million in stock, and our Board of Directors has approved an additional 20% dividend increase, meaning we now have doubled our quarterly dividend over the past two years. Now let’s go through some of the geographies. Company operating income increased 21% sequentially. North America grew 15%, Europe, Africa/CIS 16%, and Latin America more than doubled by growing 126% from the prior quarter. In North America, activity levels continued to surge higher month over month due to an unprecedented level of service intensity. As you will recall, I called the turn two quarters ago. This quarter, things are clearly accelerating out of that turn, and we do not see momentum slowing anytime soon. We also made excellent progress on pricing and our stimulation contract renewals and on cost recovery for ongoing contracts. Across key basins, we have negotiated higher prices that at a minimum should recover current and expected future cost inflation, and we should begin to see the full impact of new contract pricing as we move in to 2015. Now a hot topic today is obviously proppant and sand logistics, and we did experience some disruptions early in the third quarter where work was delayed because we were waiting on sand deliveries, and we did in fact miss some jobs as did nearly every other service company. But I can tell you, we have great people who helped us manage through this challenge each and every day, and we have now taken actions to get ahead of this issue going forward, and Jeff will provide details on this in a few minutes. Now moving to our international markets, despite the geopolitical issues we faced in areas like Russia, Libya, and Iraq, our eastern hemisphere activity continues to expand at a steady rate. On the strength of markets like Saudi Arabia, Southern Iraq, West Africa, and the Caspian, we are on track to deliver double-digit revenue growth for the full year 2014. In addition, we expect to be awarded $1 billion of new work in Iraq. And consistent with previous years, we expect the fourth quarter in the eastern hemisphere to be our strongest quarter of the year due to seasonal year-end software and equipment sales. So, over the last three years, we’ve delivered industry-leading, double-digit revenue growth in the eastern hemisphere, and as we look ahead to 2015, we anticipate the rate of growth may slightly moderate due to headwinds from ongoing geopolitical issues as well as customer spending adjustments, especially among the IOCs as they seek to achieve better returns for their company. And although double-digit growth may be a challenge for any service company next year, we fully expect to continue to outpace our peers in revenue growth whatever market is handed to us. Now let’s move to Latin American. This has been an area that’s had a tough year. Even with better revenue in the third quarter, margins and overall activity levels still do not meet my expectations, due primarily to continued operational delays in Mexico. But as we look ahead, I see several positive factors finally coming in to play. First, we are up and running on our integrated projects in Mexico and expect to be at full operational capacity in early 2015. We are also excited about the pace of Mexico energy reform and expect to see strong opportunities in Mexico shale, mature fields, and deepwater markets in the coming years. In Brazil, negotiations on the recently retendered directional-drilling contract are progressing, and we expect to be operating under the new and more profitable contract as we transition into the first quarter. And last but not least, we are very excited about our recent multi-billion dollar award in Ecuador where we expect strong growth as these projects ramp up next year. So for Latin America, I expect a much strong 2015 and we are well positioned for tremendous growth potential in the coming years. Now before I close, I have to recognize that there is currently a concern about the recent decline in commodity prices. I am not going to predict what the oil price is going to be, but on a longer term, we believe industry fundamentals suggest that these lower prices are not sustainable. While we might be in a slight oversupply situation right now, remember demand is still growing. Therefore considering North America and OPEC production expectations, the continued tightness in global spare production capacity and potential geopolitical impacts on non-OPEC production, we believe that supply and demand will essentially be back in balance in a relatively short period of time. Nevertheless, we are keenly aware that there is a risk of a moderation in activity if oil prices remain weak for an extended period of time. What I can tell you is that in recent conversations with our North America customers, we have not received any indication of activity levels slowing as we transition into 2015. For example, last week the IEA commented that approximately 98% of North America liquids projects have a breakeven price below $80 per barrel and over 80% work below $60 a barrel. On the international front, the majority of our NOC customers have not indicated that their activity levels will slow down at all. However, as I mentioned before, we are ready expecting our IOC customers to moderate their capital budgets in 2015 to improve their individual company returns. That being said, we can’t be in denial about what is happening in the market today. As you know, I have been around the block a few times and I can tell you our management team is well equipped to handle this kind of uncertainty. We will control what we can control in areas such as cost management, contract price renewals and managing customer relationships. We know that we can do these things very well. My experiences taught me that if we keep the franchise strong and growing, and I can tell you that we are going to do that, aligned with the right customers which we’ve already done and take care of our employees, we will be fine in the long run. Whether this uncertainty lasts for a few months or longer, we are ready for any market. I think we are well positioned as a company to capture all of the market upside potential for you, while giving you protection to any downside. Strategically we are structured to deliver the lowest cost per barrel to our customers, which in turn positions them and Halliburton to perform best in volatile markets. As such we believe oil prices will have to remain at lower levels for a sustained period before the long term economics would begin to impact our primary customers. So to sum it up, our overall strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. Whatever the market, we believe we can outperform our peers, and we remained focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance and providing industry leading shareholder returns. We have delivered this to you in the past and I believe we will continue to do so in the future. Now let me turn the call over to Mark to provide you some financial details. Mark.
Mark McCollum: Thanks Dave and good morning. Let me begin with an overview of our third quarter results, starting with North America. Revenues were up 9% sequentially. This strong all organic growth was relative to a 3% increase in the US land rig count. Operating income was up 15% over the same period, margins for the quarter averaged 19.2% with our September exit rate coming in slightly higher than the 20% mark. Stronger activity levels in US land and the rebound from the Canadian spring breakup drove the improvement for the quarter, more than offsetting increased logistics cost and the impact of loop currents in the Gulf of Mexico. Margins also benefited from modest pricing improvements on pressure pumping contract renewals, which were designed to cover inflation on specific cost categories such as transportation, fuel and labor. In the Eastern Hemisphere, revenue and operating income increased sequentially by 4% and 6% respectively. Growth was led by Europe Africa/CIS where revenue and operating income increased 6% and 16% respectively compared to the prior quarter. Seasonal increases in Russia and the Caspian, higher activity in Angola, along with increased well, construction activity in continental Europe, led the sequential improvement. Partially offsetting these increases were activity declines in Libya, Algeria and Norway. The seasonal recovery in Russia was negatively affected by the recent sanctions and growth in this market is expected to be a challenge for the foreseeable future, since we’ll be prohibited from tendering projects that fall under the sanctioned restrictions. We expect our Russia business will continue to face headwinds next year, including the possibility of additional sanctions, but we are hopeful that full-year 2015 could come in at similar levels to this year. Middle East /Asia region revenue increased by 3% sequentially and operating income was in line with the second quarter. Activity improvements in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, India and Indonesia during the quarter were mostly offset by sequential declines in stimulation work in Malaysia and Australia. On a year -over-year basis, we’ve seen tremendous revenue growth across Middle East/Asia, Saudi is leading with a 60% improvement and India, Iraq, and Thailand have all delivered growth over 30%. The conflict in Iraq resulted in a shutdown of the majority of activities in Kurdistan in northern Iraq. However, the majority of our operations had been in southern Iraq away from the fighting where activity levels have remained relatively stable. At this point activity is gradually returning to Kurdistan and overall we expect Iran to be a growth market for us in 2015. In Latin America revenue increased 16% sequentially, while operating income more than doubled compared to the previous quarter. Mexico was the primary driver where we saw benefit of higher activity on our Humapa project and recent contract approvals, which resulted in an increase in consulting and software revenue for the quarter. We also experienced higher testing and directional drilling activity in Brazil, as well as increased work over and stimulation activity in Venezuela. Our corporate and other expense totaled $83 million for the quarter a little lower than anticipated, driven by a reduction in strategic initiative cost and lower legal expenses. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the fourth quarter will be approximately $90 million. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 25%, primarily driven by an adjustment to reflect the recoverability of our net operating loss carry forwards in Brazil. For the fourth quarter you are expecting the effective tax rate to return to our normalized rate of approximately 28 % to 29%. We now expect our 2014 capital expenditures will be approximately $3.2 billion and depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.1 billion for the year. During the third quarter we recorded income of $66 million in discontinued operations. This is primarily related to settlement with KBR for amount sold to us under our tax sharing agreement with them. We announced today that a Board of Directors approved a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.15-$0.18 per share, resulting in a cumulative 100% increase to our quarterly dividend over the last two years. As previously stated, our intention going forward is for our dividend payout to equal at least 15% to 20% of our net income. Additionally, based on our continued confidence in our business prospects, we bought back an additional $300 million in shares during the third quarter. We still have $5.7 billion remaining in repurchase authorization from a Board of Directors available for future stock buybacks. Now moving to the Eastern Hemisphere outlook; in the fourth quarter, we are anticipating moderate growth resulting in a mid-single digit percentage sequential improvement in revenue, with margins in the upper teens. Middle East/Asia is expected to have a high single digit sequential improvement, with margins approaching 20% for the quarter. We expect our Europe, Africa/CIS region to be relatively flat as a result of geopolitical challenges in Russia and Libya and reduced customer spending in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. In Latin America, we expect mid-single digit sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter, with margins improving modestly from the third quarter. This improvement is expected to result from year-end software and product sales as well as the continued ramp up of our IPM and asset management projects in Mexico. Concluding with North America; in the fourth quarter, we typically see a seasonal decline in both revenue and margins. This year, however, based on the exit rates, we saw in the third quarter, as well as the incremental equipment, we are currently deployed and considering our forecast for minimal holiday downtime this year, we believe fourth quarter revenue and margins will be flat to modestly higher than the third quarter. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff for an update on our strategy. Jeff?
Jeff Miller: Thank you. Mark and good morning everyone. I’m excited about our results this quarter, the Halliburton team is dead focused on strategy execution, and the results are clearly evident in the quarter’s industry-leading growth, with both of our divisions setting revenue records as well as revenue records for 11 of 13 product lines. As a reminder, our strategy is built around three key growth markets unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. Our unconventional strategy is designed to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil equivalent for our customers with surface efficiency, custom chemistry and subsurface insight. Our deepwater strategy is to increase reliability and reduce uncertainty. And finally our mature field’s strategy is to deliver additional hydrocarbons in declining fields by identifying new reserves and optimizing the recovery of existing reserves. Clearly these strategies are working. In North America unconventional market the topic on everyone’s mind this quarter was logistics, driven by big increases in both horizontal activity and completions intensity which is right in the sweet spot of surface efficiencies. Now compared to the prior year, US horizontal recount in the third quarter was up more than 20%. Over the same timeframe our stage count was up more than 30% and our average sand per well increased by more than 50%. While the rising recount was predominantly a Permian basin phenomena, our customers are experimenting with larger completion volumes in almost every basin. This is a fundamental change in well design that we believe is part of a continuing trend. As Dave said, earlier in the quarter, we experienced issues related to logistical disruptions, primarily around proppant. Cast in terms of surface efficiency increasing intensity presents a terrific opportunity for us. We’ve addressed these rising completion volumes by expanding our infrastructure and transport capability. This includes increasing our sand terminal capacity by over 100%, and we are on a path to double our current rate fleet. In terms of the last mile, trucking from the railhead out to the location we’ve added over 30 new contract suppliers so far this year, giving us a better footprint in the capacity to handle these intense volumes of work. Additionally, we implemented a sand logistics command centre in Houston, where operation personnel monitor supply levels in the basins and the set with transport and procurement specialists for tracking our rail and trucking fleets all in real time. The combination of these steps resulted in a sharp increase in efficiency and we are confident that this integrated approach to logistics will continue to differentiate Halliburton. A quick update on our CYPHER seismic-to-stimulation platform; we are now at over 60 projects running, with more in the pipeline. In addition to taking on new work, we are also seeing customers expand CYPHER engagements to multiple basins in North America. Most recently we started a multi-year CYPHER project in the Permian basis incorporating the full breadth of our products and services. We are only a few months in to the study, but early wells have already seen more than a 20% increase in average production compared to offset wells. And CYPHER continues to serve as an engine for commercializing new technology like RockPerm a proprietary chemistry service that enables better oil flow and then FRACINSIGHT a Halliburton software package to help customers optimize the perforation placement and deliver the most efficient wells. We are very pleased with the client uptake on the CYPHER platform and typically see follow-on work in additional basins with those same clients. Our execution of surface efficiency, custom chemistry and subsurface insight led to more than 20% extra rate margins for North America in the third quarter. In deepwater we remain focused on technology that reduces uncertainty and improves reliability for our customers. I will give you a couple of examples of technology that are getting traction right now. The GeoTap IDS which is a sampling-while-drilling tool allows clients to take multiple fluid samples which reduces uncertainty while at the same time reducing costly rig time. Another is BaraECD which is a drilling fluid that allows customers to stabilize circulating density enabling them to reliably drill more complex wells. We have already seen success on a global basis from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Sea to the offshore Asia, and most recently in deepwater Angola. But the real point here is that we are executing a technology strategy that does exactly what we say to help clients reduce uncertainty and increase reliability in deepwater. And now finally in mature fields, our customers continue to look for ways to enhance recovery rates, whether through discreet product offerings such as a recently acquired Progressive Cavity Pump technology or through large scale asset management projects. Let me highlight just a couple of these large project opportunities. The first is the recently awarded IGAPO project in Ecuador. This is a project that provides asset management across nine mature fields. This is a 15 year project that we expect to provide a stable, long term revenue stream that could potentially double our business in the country, representing a multi-billion dollar opportunity over the full term of the project. We are very excited about this opportunity in Ecuador and expect work to begin late in the first quarter of 2015. Second, we recently extended and integrated drilling project in southern Iraq and are encourage by progress on several other significant IPM projects in the country. We believe these opportunities will provide a platform for continued double-digit growth in the Middle East region throughout 2015. Now beyond these recent awards, we are currently evaluating a pipeline of well over $30 billion worth of IPM work, which gives us confidence that we are on the right track with our mature field strategy. And in closing we believe that our strategies continue to provide growth opportunities. Our technology, infrastructure and processes are aligned and we are relentlessly focused on superior growth margins and returns. Now I will turn the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?
Dave Lesar: Alright, thank you Jeff. Before we go to the questions let me summarize what you heard today. North American exit margins greater than 20%, our new equipment will be going to work at at least those exit margins. We are building our North American logistics to get ahead of the curve. We made good progress this quarter negotiating price increases with our customers and in Latin America headwinds are becoming tailwinds, and 2015 is shaping up to be a much stronger year. In the Eastern Hemisphere there are few troubled spots, but we still an opportunity for steady growth in the coming year and we continue to focus on delivering the highest shareholder returns as evidenced by our 20% dividend increase in addition of $300 million of stock repurchases during the quarter. Before I close I want to make one final comment on the current environment. The strategic initiatives we’ve been working on the last several years Battle Red, Frac of the Future and others make us what I believe is the most efficient and adaptable organization in the industry. We are able to execute equally well in either a boom market or one that’s more challenged. Across the board, we are focused on making better wells for our customers and better returns for you our shareholders. So no matter what market is handed to us, our strategies give us confidence that we will continue to outperform our peers. So with that let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) our first question comes from James West of ISI. Your line is now open.
James West - ISI: First of all, just congrats on the substantial year-over-year growth in Eastern Hemisphere well above your peers. I suspect Joe Rainey is pretty proud of what he’s been able accomplish. And then Dave as you mentioned, you’ve been around the block a couple of times here, and I wanted to know kind of what’s your gut telling you right now about the outlook for North America as we go into next year? I know it’s a tough question, but it’s on everybody’s mind, and given your history in the industry, I was curious about kind of your feel for what you think is going to happen next year.
Dave Lesar: Let me let Jeff take the first crack at it and then I will come in at the end if I feel I need to add something.
Jeff Miller: Our outlook today is very positive. We are in the heavy part of our renewal period now, and I would tell you that renewals are rolling up not down, and as of last week, I talked to a lot of customers and budgets are moving up, not down. So in terms of activity, everything I see looks like its increasing into 2015 and quite frankly our strategy that we have in place around delivering the lowest cost per BOE in the market is more valuable than ever.
Dave Lesar: So I guess let me just add, I think if you want to summarize it, we are not feeling, hearing, seeing anything that says this momentum is going to change that we had coming out of Q3.
James West - ISI: And then on the international side, I think you gave a good outline of most of the regions around the world, you know some obviously slowness from the IOCs, but the same type of commentary around the NOCs in the international markets, no commentary around them slowing down.
Jeff Miller: Not seen any of that James. This is Jeff, the capital is going to work, it’s going to work in mature fields, it’s going to work in unconventionals, maybe more so than deepwater, but again where we are positioned and what we are seeing around integrated asset management opportunities as in just a traditional work, nothing leads us to believe that from an IOC perspective there is any change - NOC perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo: Question on the fourth quarter, you had indicated North American margins are -- you exited at 20%. I believe Mark indicated you thought only a slight increase in margins from 3Q to 4Q. Is that just allowing for seasonality or how should we think about the fourth quarter –a seasonally fourth quarter where your exit rate was above kind of what you had indicated, I guess?
Mark McCollum: Hey Jud this is Mark. Yeah, that’s exactly right, you know we always try to consider that fourth quarter you have some holiday down time, you are going to have some seasonality particularly in the Rockies where we have a dominant market position that will impact operations as you close out the year. But what we are doing is we are looking at every thing on balance; first of all very strong exit rates, second of all very strong activity levels that month-over-month continues to increase. When we are working, our equipment is working very hard. We had already indicated earlier in the year that we’ve been building additional frac equipment, you know we’ll have new spreads that are already hitting the street today that will be active during the fourth quarter, that will be adding to our complement of equipment that will be generating revenues, and so when you take all that on balance, we are just saying that this fourth quarter uniquely looks like one that we could have a slightly better earnings and profits in this fourth quarter in North America than you might see in a traditional fourth quarter. Now that’s assuming a very sort of standard weather pattern, standard holiday downtime. But from our base outlook, it looks like its going to be a very good Q4.
Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo: And then if I could may be stretch the margin outlook into 2015, understanding that customers aren’t really indicating a slowdown at this point, if we were to see some operators sort of scale back activity or just flatten out their budgets, can you help us think about -- Halliburton’s going to have a lot of moving parts, you are negotiating new contract at higher pricing, it sounds like now. If you see a softness in utilization and you are obviously recovering some of your recent cost increases as well; how should we think about your margins in 2015 if we were to see a slow down. Is it a situation where you think you could hold the line of margins, would they decline potentially or could they still go up because of the net pricing you are already starting to see in your contracts?
Jeff Miller: Yeah Jud this is Jeff. Our entire strategy is built around delivering Frac of the Future or HALvantage. If we roll back to our analyst day, we’d always said that we would continue to put more efficient equipment in the market and more efficient work practices so that we would be able to improve margins on the back of the way that we are working. So as I look out into 2015, we are seeing those fundamental pieces of our business continuing to deliver which clearly means that we continue to see a positive impact on margins.
Dave Lesar: Yeah I think, let me just one thing, if you go again, go back to analyst day, the impact of things like Battle Red, Frac of the Future and other things that you were doing at that point, we thought could add five points in margin without any price increases. And we are not backing off that view. A lot of the push up and margins right now are just those things been implemented and us been more efficient as an organization. So I think to answer the question specifically, if you did have a flattening out, I would expect that our margins would be at least where they are today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.
Angie Sedita - UBS: So there was intensity growth of 50% quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year was pretty amazing, and I know Jeff touched on it a little bit. But could you give us additional color there on what you are seeing on the oil service intensity side and I know you indicated it was [basin], but can you go in to that a little bit. And then thoughts on 2015, what kind of any insights at this point on the degree of service intensity growth that we could see this year and clearly its worth noting that even if the rig count is flat and the well count is flat you are still driving higher revenues in margins.
Jeff Miller: The (inaudible) intensity continue to increase on the basis of the types of jobs that are being designed and so we’ve seen a consistent increase in the amount of proppant and the amount of stages. So I refer specifically to 30% increase in stage count, 50% increase in sand consumption. I would say that you see a bigger ramp in the more mature basins, because that’s where we are really getting in to what I’d call sort of hyper efficiency and increasing the production of existing wells as oppose to way before its’ a little bit more, I will use it with quotes around it “exploratory” in a few basins. But as I look in to 2015, I don’ see anything that changes the pace of increase necessarily across the piece simply because we are making better wells, and that’s what takes us back to the importance sand logistics and the ability to deliver. I will give you a one quick anecdote; for us that have seen trains load, we can unload an entire unit train in nine hours and we can load a truck in seven minutes. So that’s kind of where we are focusing our attention.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Okay, that’s helpful. And then thinking about this oil service intensity growth and it’s reported out there, we are going to add 1.5 million to 2 million in horsepower next year. How much do you think of that is being added with standalone crews and they are actually full (inaudible) fleets and how much of that horsepower do you think is reinforcement for existing fleets; that there is much of the third or even more.
Jeff Miller: No, I mean when we look at that our expectation that’s probably less than 10% coming in to the market, and the fact is the equipment is working harder than it has ever worked before given the size of the stages and the amount of the sand. So my expectation is most of that equipment will either be backup equipment, four big jobs now with our Q-10 pumps we are more effective with typically 20% less horsepower on location, and quite frankly less back up. I put very little backup equipment to work in the market. So that’s kind of the takeaway is not that concerned, really not concerned about additional horsepower.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Sorry to [harpoon] on the sand this year, but some pretty staggering number of 50% up high and kind of what we have heard from other players. Do you think that’s something that deals with Halliburton’s customer base and the opposition in the market or do you think this is sort of an industry trend.
Jeff Miller: Well I think it’s a little bit of both Ole, we are working with fairway players, we’ve always said that we make it a point to work with the most efficient operators in the market place so that we get the maximum utilization of the technology we are putting in the markets. So we are pumping more sand may be then competitors would not surprise me at all. But I do think longer term there will be a continued move towards better frac design thinking about our CYPHER technology how we design the best fracs to get the most production out of the wells. And I do believe that will lead us to a continuation of larger volumes.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: So how are you scaling your infrastructure over the next say two years, and what are you planning for as far as your experience for 2015-’16 volume growth per well.
Jeff Miller: Well let me think about it this way and in terms of what we are doing to address that. I think the volumes will continue to increase across the piece that may not stay at the same rate of increase. But from our standpoint, we’ll continue to invest in logistics and control the supply chain really from mine to the last well, from the mine to the last mile it gets us to two locations which looks like sand transloading and investment in rail cars. And these are things that overcome the logistics problems that seem to occur.
Mark McCollum: Which we are certainly – Ole this is Mark just to add to that, from a contracting standpoint, we are working very hard to make sure that we’ve got all the sand dates that we are forecasting under contract. You know we’ll probably have 80% of our sand needs contracted this year it may go up to 90% next year. By contracting our sand, looking forward that allows us to shave off anywhere from 15% to 20% off of a spot of sand pricing. Doing the same on rail cars making sure that we’ve got plenty of capacity to run full unit trains, making sure that our transloading facilities each one are designed to offload complete unit trains. We are the only one so far I think to have managed to be able to really offload complete unit trains on sight on some of our location, and we are just going to look forward to where our customers are saying they are going to be running these volumes and make sure that the infrastructures onsite to be able to run as lean and efficient as we possibly can.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open.
Bill Herbert – Simmons: Dave and Jeff to tackle the international question just a little bit differently. You guys have been consistent and you’ve been correct here with regard to just the pace of international expansion in general over the past several years, and when I look at your numbers for 2014 and juxtapose them against the preceding couple of years, you will likely end up somewhere kind of high-single digits year-over-year in ’14 versus kind of a low teens rate of expansion in ’13 and a 20% rate of expansion in ’12. So when we contemplate 2015 against the slate of opportunities and threats, at this juncture do you think you will do well to match your international rate of growth of this year or should we expect something less.
Jeff Miller: So the answer to that was, we expect outgrow the market or outgrow our competitors in that space. There clearly are some headwinds when we look around the world right now. So the North Sea, Russia and Libya are clearly going to present headwinds, so quite encouraged around tailwinds in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. So when I think about growth, more specifically, it may be more of where capital gets put to work, may be than it has been in the past we talked a lot about deepwater, potential moderation as IOCs look at their capital budgets. But that said, the barrels come from somewhere and our expectation is that we may see more of that capital going in to development and mature field type of opportunities, and so for that reason I am still very encouraged about our ability to sustain growth in to 2015 that would be sort of similar to where we are now.
Bill Herbert - Simmons: Okay, and the billion dollar project in Iraq, can you elaborate on that and also I guess to play devils’ advocate for a second, why would we even want that given the travails that the industry has witnessed over the past several years there.
Dave Lesar: Let me answer that (inaudible) your first question was your [output] in reverse order. Why would we want that work? The fact is we are a lot smarter in that market than we’ve ever been. I think we were early in to that market and underestimated the risk around logistics and a few other things. We really like the contract the way this one looks in terms of terms and conditions. So feel good about that. The project itself I won’t name the project, but it’s a great project, its four rigs to drill, 120 wells over the next probably three years. We have invested heavily in putting our IPM team together and they are really executing it. So if I think how we execute on mature fields longer term, these are the kind of projects that we are going to do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: May be just a quick one, your CapEx commentary I guess just a little bit lighter than second quarter commentary. What are you reflecting in that, is that a difficulty in spending some capital, and you will spend it in ’15 or are you actually shaving it relative to some of the commentary you’ve given us this morning.
Jeff Miller: There’s not been any kind of a conservative effort to shave capital. I think its probably a little bit tighter forecast particularly as we look forward in some of the projects in the eastern hemisphere. It just takes some time off and times to get things approved and so it’s just timing. So you will see some of that coming in to probably the early part of 2015.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: And then maybe an unrelated to follow-up and may be it’s a bit broader. If I look at your North America D&E revenues, over the nine months it’s sort of tracking the rig count, but I think it’s up 6% again nine months versus nine months and that’s relative to your horizontal rig count up 13% of US land any way or in the US. So I know there’ some other factors and may be you will fill that in to the answer. But how does – what the prognosis for how that is moving forward, are there some things that that might move in place that can accelerate D&E and they can align better with the horizontal rig count. Are there some factors that continue to suggest it will somewhat less than that?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, and I think what you are seeing the current quarter is a bit of impact of the Gulf of Mexico. So we experienced loop currents like everybody else, and so we had a quite a bit slower activity in the Gulf of Mexico in the current quarter. But the well construction type activity is going to track generally speaking the rig count. But we are really encouraged as we look Q4 and beyond hit the loop currents behind us. We really like our share in the Gulf of Mexico right now, and it’s a growing share in the Gulf of Mexico.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Eastern hemisphere production really hasn’t grown much in the last couple of years, and you guys are setting records in terms of operating income and revenues, and the US of course has been growing. Is the level of activity in the eastern hemisphere somewhat inelastic considering that we at least have to maintain production.
Jeff Miller: Yes Jim, that’s the right answer. We are working harder and harder to produce arguably the same number of barrels, but those barrels are critical to number of economies around the world, and so when we look at sort of outlook; two things, one, the projects that are started have to continue. These are long duration type projects, they don’t turn on and off, and then secondly, there are a lot of mature field type activity that we know would lower exploration risk almost nil exploration risks. Those are projects that create terrific returns for our customers. So I think those two conspire to give you an inelastic sort of outlook.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: And my follow-up, if I could, there’s so much the same for in North America. If the US unconventional production starts to decline on an unconventional hyperbolic, the amount of effort it takes to reverse that is huge. So how much activity in the US is needed to maintain not grow, but just maintain existing US production. You all have done that work?
Jeff Miller: It’s quite a bit of the work that’s going on now, and I guess Jim the way I would answer that is, rather than give you a percentage, I would say that we know the decline rates on existing wells’ fairly dramatic. We know what it takes in order to continue to improve that. So I would expect that sustaining activity or sustaining production in North America takes a quite a big chunk of the work that’s going on now.
Dave Lesar: Jim this is Dave, I would just add one thing and I think we refer to it as sort of the treadmill effect. What you want to do is get your customers in a basin where they’ve got sufficient amount of production that they have to get on the treadmill if you will to keep that production going, because that’s a great place for a service company to be, and a great place for the lowest cost most efficient service company to be, because helping the customers stay on that treadmill as it gets faster and the incline goes up is part of the whole hyper efficiency model that we try to offer up to our customers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Market. Your line is now open.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Market: I just had a follow-up question regarding the frac dynamics in US and you guys have discussed for many quarters now cost recovery process, it seems like that is now beginning to take hold. Just wondering what your perspective is terms of the incremental capacity that’s been added recently and whether or not some of that cost recovery can turn in to net pricing gains from an industry standpoint going forward.
Jeff Miller: I can’t speak for the industry, but we’ll speak for Halliburton, and this is right in our wheel house. As you said recovering inflation has really been the order of the day, but as we go through the renewals and we sort of establish inflationary increases that keep us whole, very quickly we drop back in to our ability to manage cost and drive efficiency which should allow us of it does allow us to convert that inflation in to net pricing to the extent to which we compete at the market, and this precisely why we implement and have advantage and the logistics advantages we have Battle Red, Frac of the Future and that’s what conspires to deliver our exit rates in excess 20%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Doug Becker - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Mark you mentioned Europe, Africa/ CIS would be relatively flat in the fourth quarter, wanted to confirm that this is for revenues as well as margins. And then just get a little additional color on the growth, or just how that region grows revenues and margins next year given that North Sea revenues are likely down and it would be challenge just to keep Russian revenues flat.
Mark McCollum: The answer is it does relate to both, yes revenues and margins. I mean typically you might see margins climb up a bit on the back of some level of direct sales, completion tool sales, things like that. But I think this quarter given where we are seeing some of the softness particularly the Norwegian sector, the North Sea in Q4 we are expecting it to be more flat to Q3 on both the revenue and the margin side.
Doug Becker - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: And for next year?
Mark McCollum: It’s a little early to know for next year where it’s going to go. I mean obviously everything that we are trying to do across the board is to improve margins by cutting cost and things like that. As we look forward to next year, I think we do see some continued softness in the Norwegian sector and the North Sea. Russia as I said on the call will likely be, hopefully we are working to be flat year-over-year on an overall basis and we’ll have Libya’s down for the count right now, so it’s difficult to forecast when that will be. But when you look at other markets across Europe, Africa and CIS, you know the Caspian continues to do very well. When you look at sub-Saharan Africa itself, we had a very good year, we expect that will continue to grow on the back of mature field projects there. And Continental Europe for us is doing exceedingly well right now and we expect that that will go up as well. So as we go in to the year, while a still little bit early in the planning cycle, I would say we are still expecting it to be up and with that we are continuing to leverage incremental margins that are higher than current margins and so we are expecting margins to continue to decline in that area as well, even though it might be able, but less in the Middle East/Asia.
Operator: And our final question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: Mark you’ve promised this 500 basis points kind of margin improvement through the course of the years from internal [miles] Frac of the Future and HALvantage. How much of that has already been realized and what is left for the coming years.
Mark McCollum: I would tell you that our goal was to get a 200 basis point improvement in 2014. As of the day we have accomplished that objective. We had hoped that it would be for the entire year Q3, we didn’t quite get there, but we were very close. If it hadn’t been for some of logistics challenges that we had in the month of July, we would have indeed had hit that target. So as we look forward, we are comfortable with where we are at, but I can tell you that really on the face of Battle Red we still got a long way to go. All of our systems are in place, we’ve been working out a lot of the kinks in that process, but a lot of the upsights from that project are still in front of us. On the Frac to the Future side we are only still quarter deployed. We got a long way to go in terms of achieving that. So we are going to continue to work a very, very focused and determine lead to make sure that we capture all that upsight. So as we sit today, we feel very good about our progression and let us know from our standpoint no retreat from our objective of getting 500 basis points over the next couple of years.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: And them I may have missed that before, but could you quantify the impact of Gulf of Mexico on the D&E margins and revenues for the quarter.
Mark McCollum: I don’t know if we could quantify it overall for D&E, but I’d say that the Gulf of Mexico, the loop current issue probably caused us about a penny in the quarter.
Operator: At this time I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing comments.
Jeff Miller: So thanks Sam. I want to thank everybody for your participation today and Sam you can go ahead and close the call.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program, you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton's second quarter 2014 conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and a replay would be available on Halliburton's Web site for seven days. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Jeff Miller, COO. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Forms 10K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Form 10Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, recent current reports on Form 8K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason. Now I’ll turn the call over to Dave, Dave?
Dave Lesar:  Thank you Kelly and good morning everyone. I am obviously very pleased with our second quarter results and here are the headlines, record company revenue this quarter of $8.1 billion, double-digit sequential revenue growth and new quarterly records in both North America and Middle East/Asia. We once again delivered industry-leading revenue growth both sequentially and year-over-year compared to our primary peers. We had strong cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion and our Board has approved an increase in our buyback authorization to $6 billion. I am also pleased to announce the promotion of Jeff Miller to President and his appointment to Halliburton’s Board, effective August 1st. I’ve known and worked with Jeff for 25 years and I am absolutely confident he will do an excellent job leading our very strong management team. Now for some details around our performance this quarter, company operating income increased 23% sequentially, led by a 31% increase in North America operating income, with an impressive 280 basis point improvement in margins to 18.2%. The Eastern hemisphere had an equally impressive 220 basis point margin improvement to 16% resulting from a 26% growth in operating income. Now on our last call some of you may have been skeptical when I said I was beginning to feel the turn in North America, but based on our performance during the quarter I believe this feeling was dead on target. Today we are not feeling the turn, we are in the turn and I feel even more excited than I was last quarter about the outlook for the North American market. Why is that? During the quarter we saw our completion volumes continue to rise and I don’t see that changing. Our logistics infrastructure is more of a differentiator than ever before. We were successful in getting cost recovery from our customers. And we estimate the percentage of excess horsepower has dropped below the 10% mark and capacity has tightened to the point that the market will require new horsepower to meet customer demand. As you know, based on the competitive advantage of our Frac of the Future, our plan has always been to upgrade our fleet to Q10s over time. These current trends provide us confidence that now is the appropriate time to accelerate our Q10 build schedule. We anticipate incremental fleets arriving in the fourth quarter and throughout 2015. We’ve also been investing to increase our logistics capability as well. I am confident that these are the right moves. So even in the unlikely event the market softens, we always have the option of accelerating the retirement schedule of older equipment and replacing them with Q10s. Now moving to our international operations, Eastern Hemisphere activity continues to expand at the steady rate that we expected. But you know what, steady is exciting for us because it demonstrates that our view of the market was the correct one and that we are sized and scoped correctly to turn industry-leading revenue growth into steadily increasing margins. Our outlook for the full year remains intact. We are still targeting our Eastern Hemisphere revenue growth to be in the low double-digits with average full year margins in the upper-teens and approaching 20% by the end of the year. Second quarter margins of 16% show we are on-track to deliver that. Turning to Latin America, we faced issues around revenue timing during the quarter. Now it’s easy for me to give my head around the issues, and I can see a path forward to normalized profitability. But I am certainly not thrilled with how some of the things played out this quarter; first, there was an issue with the late receipt of our software consulting blanket order from PEMEX, which impacted our ability to book revenue to offset our costs, which of course significantly hurt second quarter results. This should reverse itself in the second half of the year. Second, we were mobilizing for two large integrated projects which resulted in cost, but minimal revenue, for the quarter. This also should reverse itself in the second half of the year. Lastly, the rig count approached a 10 year low and social disruptions impacted operations resulting in reduced discrete service activity in Mexico. However, we remain encouraged by the prospect of energy reform in Mexico and believe that as the market gains more certainty around the direction of reform future service activity will increase. And in Brazil we are pleased with our customers’ decision to re-tender the deepwater drilling contract, which should allow us to right-size our footprint there. So looking at the full year, we continue to target 2014 Latin America margins to be in line with the prior year at approximately 13%. Now let me be clear about one thing, and I’ve been around long enough to know, headwinds become tailwinds therefore I am optimistic about our future growth potential in Latin America as we go into 2015. So our overall strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. Our leadership position in North America positions us well to capture the upside of this exciting and quickly evolving market, and we are continuing to realize significant revenue and margin expansion in our international business. We remain dead focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance and providing industry-leading shareholder returns to you. Now I am going to turn the call over to Mark to provide financial details. Mark?
Mark McCollum: Thanks Dave and good morning. Let me begin with an overview of our second quarter results. Starting with North America, revenues were up 11% sequentially relative to a 4% increase in U.S. land rig count. And operating income was up 31% over the same period. Margins increased to 18.2%. Stronger activity levels in U.S. land primarily drove the improvement for the quarter. Margins also benefited from modest pricing improvements on pressure pumping contract renewals, which were designed to cover inflation on specific cost categories such as transportation, fuel and labor. These improvements were partially offset by the Canadian spring breakup and lower sequential profitability in the Gulf of Mexico due to the timing of completions activity. In the Eastern Hemisphere, revenue and operating income increased sequentially by 9% and 26% respectively, as a result of growth in both the Middle East/Asia and Europe/Africa/ CIS regions. We experienced a seasonal rebound in revenue and margins after encountering typical first quarter weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Russia and Australia. In our Middle East/Asia region, revenue and operating income increased by 11% and 25% respectively compared to the first quarter. Saudi Arabia showed strong sequential improvement driven by our consulting, directional drilling and drilling fluids product lines. We are very excited about this market and continue to see revenue and profitability improving at a very aggressive rate. Additionally, we continue to see solid growth across the majority of our Asia Pacific countries with Australia, Malaysia and China leading the pack for the quarter. The current situation in Iraq has resulted in some logistics bottlenecks and increased security measures but our operations which are in Southern Iraq and in Kurdistan are away from the fighting and are continuing. We continue to expect the Middle East region to have the highest growth rate for the full year 2014 despite the potential for activity disruptions in Iraq later this year. However, contract renewals and tenders for new work in Iraq are currently being pushed back which may mute our growth expectations as we exit the year. Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue and operating income increased 6% and 27% respectively compared to the prior quarter. The seasonal activity rebound in the North Sea and Russia led to sequential improvement. Additionally, sub-Saharan Africa showed sequential improvement, led by drilling activity gains in Angola and higher completions, intervention in pipeline processing services in Nigeria, Ghana and Congo. The Russia sanctions have not had a material impact on our activity levels up to this point, but there is some risk related to certain projects that are being tendered later this year. Latin America revenue increased 4% sequentially while operating income declined by 39%. Despite double-digit revenue improvement this quarter in Venezuela, Argentina and Colombia, we were negatively impacted by project mobilization and the blanket order delays in Mexico which Dave previously discussed. Our corporate and other expense totaled $107 million for the quarter, a little higher than anticipated, driven by retirement cost and higher professional fees. We invested approximately $15 million in our HALvantage strategic initiative during the second quarter. These activities should wrap-up this next quarter. We anticipate that corporate expenses for the third quarter will run approximately $90 million to $100 million. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 28%. For the remainder of 2014, we are expecting the effective tax rate to be approximately 28% to 29%. Cash flow from operations during the second quarter was $1.1 billion, an increase of approximately 18% compared to the first quarter. Excluding the $215 million in acquisitions made this quarter, we have generated approximately $356 million in cash and marketable securities during the quarter. As we progress through 2014, we believe we are well-positioned to generate significantly more cash and that our cash flow will continue to grow in the coming years. As a reminder, we are working to grow the percentage of cash available for distribution to shareholders to roughly 35% of our operating cash flows over the next few years, which is nearly double our historic average. As discussed, we intend to accelerate our Q10 build schedule and expand our logistics infrastructure. As a result we now expect that our 2014 capital expenditures will be approximately $3.3 billion, an increase of $300 million compared to our previous guidance. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.1 billion during 2014. Now moving to the Eastern Hemisphere outlook, in the third quarter we are anticipating a mid single-digit percentage improvement in revenue and we expect margins to migrate modestly higher into the upper-teens. Revenue is expected to continue to step higher in the fourth quarter, which is seasonally our strongest quarter of the year with margins approaching 20%. We continue to expect full year revenue growth to be in the low double-digits and margins averaging in the upper-teens. In Latin America, we expect mid-teen sequential revenue expansion in the third quarter and believe margins should approach the mid-teens. With continued improvement in revenue and margins in the fourth quarter, as a result we expect full year revenue and margins to be in line with 2013. However, our second half outlook assumes the timely approval of our billings under the blanket order in Mexico, as well as a swift resolution of the retender of our Brazil drilling contract. And concluding with North America, we are expecting revenue growth in the third quarter to outpace the rig count with North America margins approaching 20%. While we expect the rig count to continue to increase, utilization levels are very high and growth in the third quarter could be constrained by the availability of equipment until incremental fleets begin to arrive later in the year. Now I will turn the call over to Jeff for an update on our strategy. Jeff?
Jeff Miller:  Thanks, Mark and good morning everyone. Our strategy is in the deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals are clearly delivering results. These led not only to record company revenues, but also quarterly revenue records for our production enhancement, baroid, cementing, wireline, production chemicals and artificial lift product lines. So for today’s comments, I’ll focus on our execution against these three strategies. Recall that our unconventional strategy is to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil equivalent through surface efficiency, custom chemistry and subsurface insight. Let’s start with surface efficiency. We’re seeing record activity levels with year-over-year stage counts up more than 20% and profit volumes per well up about 35%. We also saw record sales of our drill well plugs for plug-and-perf operations, as well as record installations of our RapidSuite sliding sleeve technology. All of these indicators point to larger volume jobs which is precisely for the Q10 pump excels consistently delivering 20% higher flow rates with about 50% lower maintenance cost than a legacy pump. And one last comment on North America surface efficiency regarding profit and infrastructure, while we see sufficient quantities of sand at the mines, the transportation infrastructure has and will continue to experience unprecedented levels of congestion. And we see profit competing for delivery not only with other profit types, but also with oil and agricultural products. And while we’re not immune to this impact, we’re confident that we have the best developed logistics infrastructure and we plan to continue adding to this capability throughout the year. Moving on to subsurface insight, we continue to gain traction with our CYPHER platform that optimizes where to drill, how to drill, where to frac and how to frac to make better wells. CYPHER applications continue to grow with over 50 projects underway across more than a dozen basins globally, which makes me even more excited about our recent release of CYPHER 2.0. That refines our earth modeling capability, increases our simulation accuracy and allows real-time adjustments during frac treatments. And finally our Custom Chemistry solutions are helping deliver better wells. Our AccessFrac diversion technology, clean breaking PermStim and our RockPerm formation analysis have all demonstrated better production for our clients. For example AccessFrac has delivered on average 20% better performance than offset wells with market uptake tripling since last year. RockPerm was first introduced only one year ago, as a means to enhance production through better hydrocarbon mobility and it’s now used in more than one-third of our North American completions. And as we work across every basin we get to see the different methods used in all of those basins. And even as volume trends emerge our new techniques gain popularity we’re more convinced than ever. The customized frac design and customized fluid chemistry delivered better, sustainable production for our clients. Now turning to the mature field space, we’re pleased with the progress of our large IPM and asset management projects. During the quarter, we were either rewarded or began mobilizing on large integrated projects in India, Kuwait, UAE and Indonesia. For example our 93 well integrated project with Cairn India, is the first IPM project in India to employ tier 1 land rigs. These projects and other provide us with a strong platform for growth in addition to a pursuit pipeline of over 30 billion in project management opportunities that we’re currently evaluating. And during the quarter, we started on the multi-decade Humapa incentivized asset management project in Mexico. Early work over operations have been successful and the production levels are already well ahead of schedule in the project. We expect to spud new wells in this asset during the second half of 2014, bringing up to two rigs by the end of the year. Also in Mexico, we spud at our first well in the Mesozoic project in late June and expect our second well to spud in late July. Our Mesozoic project represents a $1 billion opportunity over the next few years. We plan to mobilize additional rigs over the next several quarters moving towards four rigs by early 2015. And during the second quarter, we expanded our artificial lift capabilities through the acquisition of Europump, an industry leader in progressive cavity pump systems. This acquisition is an important step forward in our artificial lift strategy which complements our existing electric submersible pump technology and positions us to benefit from this growing market. Overall we’re very pleased with the progress of our mature field strategy. The Europump acquisition expands our discrete service offerings and we’re confident in our ability to execute on these large integrated projects. Looking at deepwater, we continue to increase reliability and reduce uncertainty for our customers. As we introduced new technology, we’re dramatically simplifying equipment design to increase the operability of the equipment. Examples include our full suite of high pressure open hole logging tools designed for the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our new ultra deepwater subsea control system Dash EH which is integrated with Veto, Halliburton’s premiere 3-inch 15k Subsea Safety System that performs emergency well shut-in and critical landing stream disconnect in less than 15 seconds. Specific to the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to see incremental deepwater activity for the balance of the year and an increase in lower tertiary rate completions in early 2015. In the third quarter, we expect to begin operations on an integrated deepwater project for a major customer providing drilling and completion services across multiple wells. During the second quarter, we also acquired Neftex Petroleum Consultants, a market leader in reducing uncertainly in basins the world over. Neftex has created a unique 4-D model of the subsurface already used by E&P companies worldwide to evaluate and identify resources more quickly and more accurately. We expect this acquisition will touch all three of our key strategies by integrating data and interpretations from the Neftex Earth Model with Landmark’s DecisionSpace platform. We expect to be able to accelerate our customer’s ability to explore prospects and increase our ability to predict drilling success. In closing, I want to be clear that our strategies are working. We continue to see strong long-term growth opportunities across unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. In fact I would like to highlight the performance of our Eastern Hemisphere where we’ve see revenue expand by more than 50% over the last three years with margins stair-stepping higher year-after-year. This has been a consistent focus on our three key themes that is driven this success. In mature fields, we are now the leading surface provider of primary customer against Norway driven by our focus on both discrete and integrated solutions. In unconventionals, we are the leading provider of unconventional services in Australia and recently into joint venture to expand our footprint in China. In deepwater, we have seen tremendous growth with all product lines drawing baroid fluids in Asia Pacific, creating a testing business almost from scratch, and a completions business that is now number one globally. Looking ahead, with the projects we have in place and the technology we’re putting to work, we are very optimistic about our growth prospects for the Eastern Hemisphere in the coming years. Before I hand the call back to Dave one final note, it is truly a privilege to serve as President of Halliburton. I have been part of the management team for several years and I have been part of developing our current strategies, so you should expect us to stay the course and remain dead focused on superior growth, margins, and returns. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Board and the over 80,000 Halliburton employees for their steadfast support. Now, I will turn the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?
Dave Lesar: Thanks, Jeff. In North America, we are past feeling the turn, we are in the turn and we will be accelerating our Q10 build in the order to meet customer demand. In Latin America, we feel optimistic about improved second half, but are still monitoring a few potential headwinds regardless of that 2015 is shaping up to be a strong year. In the Eastern Hemisphere, we are still on-track for low-double digit full year revenue growth with margins averaging in the upper-teens. And finally, our strong outlook for the business provides us with confidence in improving increase shareholder returns going forward as is evidenced by our increase in stock buyback authorization to a new total of $6 billion, which represents approximately 10% of our market cap today. With that, let’s open it up for questions.
Question:
and:
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now opened.
Kurt Hallead : Great, thank you. Good morning.
 RBC Capital Markets: Great, thank you. Good morning.
Dave Lesar: Hi Kurt good morning. 
Kurt Hallead : Maybe a question for either Dave or Jeff with respect to the re-tendering on Brazil, when do you think you might get the bids opened and how do you expect to see that playing out going forward I guess in the context of you still expect to be awarded in the same package that you were awarded before?
 RBC Capital Markets: Maybe a question for either Dave or Jeff with respect to the re-tendering on Brazil, when do you think you might get the bids opened and how do you expect to see that playing out going forward I guess in the context of you still expect to be awarded in the same package that you were awarded before?
Jeff Miller: Yes thanks, Kurt. That rebid is in process right now, so the documents haven’t been resubmitted. We still expect to see that conclude this year, expect early Q4. With respect to competitive positioning I am not going to share that with you here, I expect it will be competitive but in any case expect to see a healthy reset as we look ahead into the ’15 and beyond.
Kurt Hallead : Okay, great. My follow-up relates to the U.S. frac business and the accelerated deployment of the Q10 pumps and I’m sure you are aware of increased equipment orders by other players in the market. Can you help us calibrate what this may mean as it relates to the potential for pricing? You think it’s going to be more of a volume driven market or you think there’s an opportunity to get some price as time goes on?
 RBC Capital Markets: Okay, great. My follow-up relates to the U.S. frac business and the accelerated deployment of the Q10 pumps and I’m sure you are aware of increased equipment orders by other players in the market. Can you help us calibrate what this may mean as it relates to the potential for pricing? You think it’s going to be more of a volume driven market or you think there’s an opportunity to get some price as time goes on?
Jeff Miller:  Yes, Kurt let me just kind of go through what we’re seeing in the marketplace with respect to activity. We’re seeing all the right signs as capacity starts to tighten which we’ve seen fall below sort of 10% spare capacity. We see activity increasing at breakneck rate, we’re seeing some pass through of cost increases at this point and probably most importantly we have clarity of our frac calendar through the end of the year. So all of those things give it a lot of confidence in adding our equipment because we see where that’s going to go work. I think from a -- if you think more broadly about the market, again we believe in our equipment, it’s doing exactly what we thought it would do, what we described at our Analyst Day so from Halliburton’s perspective very confident that the Q10 equipment is delivering.
Kurt Hallead :  Alright, thanks, I appreciate it.
 RBC Capital Markets:  Alright, thanks, I appreciate it.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now opened. Angie please check your mute button.
Angie Sedita :  Thanks, good morning guys.
 UBS:  Thanks, good morning guys.
Dave Lesar:  Hey Angie.
Angie Sedita :  So on the Q10 roll out is there is any constraints in adding this incremental equipment if you want to accelerate it even further and can you talk about how much you’re adding incrementally as far as percentage wise from you what you were adding at the beginning of the year?
 UBS:  So on the Q10 roll out is there is any constraints in adding this incremental equipment if you want to accelerate it even further and can you talk about how much you’re adding incrementally as far as percentage wise from you what you were adding at the beginning of the year?
Jeff Miller:  Yes, thanks Angie. From a competitive standpoint we’re not going to share with you quantities of equipment and that sort of thing. But suffice to say that we have the ability, that’s one of the reasons we stay in the manufacturing business, it gives us the ability to flex more quickly and then put the equipment when and where we need it.
Angie Sedita :  So there’s no constraints in adding equipment at a more accelerated rate if you want to even up it from here or do you have any constraints in the system? And then to add to that on the legacy equipment, is it fair to say that all retirements will stop at this time or are you still seeing some retirements at the older equipment?
 UBS:  So there’s no constraints in adding equipment at a more accelerated rate if you want to even up it from here or do you have any constraints in the system? And then to add to that on the legacy equipment, is it fair to say that all retirements will stop at this time or are you still seeing some retirements at the older equipment?
Mark McCollum:  Hey Angie, this is Mark. Just so I oversee the capital side let me weigh in, we did during the second quarter stop the retirement of some of our equipment just because of the activity levels were so great; we were rolling Q10s out, the ability to leave some of the older equipment out there allowed us to basically gain a spread or so to sort of address some of that activity. From a capital standpoint we’re building to contract. We’re building to what we can see. There is the ability to dial that further if the market accelerates further, but we think that this build schedule is aggressive enough to make sure that we’re addressing the market as we see it that will be available for Halliburton over the next 18 months or so.
Angie Sedita :  Okay, helpful and then as a follow-up, you mentioned it briefly in your remarks, on the cost recoveries are you now seeing that in every instance, are there still some regions of pushback and I believe you signed a new agreement earlier this year that would actually reduce your sand cost and that you’re also doubling your rail fleet as far as your ownership of the rail fleet, could both of these start to help margins in Q3 or is it more Q4 2015?
 UBS:  Okay, helpful and then as a follow-up, you mentioned it briefly in your remarks, on the cost recoveries are you now seeing that in every instance, are there still some regions of pushback and I believe you signed a new agreement earlier this year that would actually reduce your sand cost and that you’re also doubling your rail fleet as far as your ownership of the rail fleet, could both of these start to help margins in Q3 or is it more Q4 2015?
Jeff Miller:  Yes, Angie, to address the first part of the question which is really what are we seeing across the entirety of North America. It’s not all the same in terms of tightness, nor is it the same in terms of cost. So the ability to get the cost pass throughs, we’re able to do that where we see that kind of inflation. The second part of your question around logistics, truly a place where we have a lot of confidence in our ability and our supply chain organization has a great window into the market in terms of how to acquire the inputs and as you suggested, or as we’ve said in our comments, we’ll continue to build the logistics capability that we have, and so that’ll -- across a number of different parts of that supply chain.
Angie Sedita :  Great, thanks, I’ll turn it over.
 UBS:  Great, thanks, I’ll turn it over.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Cowen. Your line is now opened. 
Jim Crandell : Thank you. Just to follow-up on the pricing question, cost pass-throughs are usually the first step and you went out of your way to say that there’s less than 10% excess capacity in the industry which seemingly sets a stage for real pricing increases and as we know your prices are well below where they were at the peak of the last cycle, when do you see it -- do you see it, and if so when do you see it coming, going from more of a cost recovery to real price increase environment in domestic pressure pumping?
 Cowen and Company: Thank you. Just to follow-up on the pricing question, cost pass-throughs are usually the first step and you went out of your way to say that there’s less than 10% excess capacity in the industry which seemingly sets a stage for real pricing increases and as we know your prices are well below where they were at the peak of the last cycle, when do you see it -- do you see it, and if so when do you see it coming, going from more of a cost recovery to real price increase environment in domestic pressure pumping?
Jeff Miller:  Yes, Jim, I can’t, I’m not going to give you a date or a time in that case, what best I can do is describe the conditions precedent which is what we’re seeing; recall oil cycles are a little different than gas cycles in terms of spikiness, so -- but we -- our build schedule and sort of our view into the market gives us a lot of confidence around kind of that what we see for the balance of this year and in ’15.
Jim Crandell : Okay. And do you see - last cycle as I recall when you were building equipment, you would not add equipment unless you sold the least four other services along with the stimulation equipment, do you have a similar strategy now this year and will you be requiring your customers to order at least three or four product lines?
 Cowen and Company: Okay. And do you see - last cycle as I recall when you were building equipment, you would not add equipment unless you sold the least four other services along with the stimulation equipment, do you have a similar strategy now this year and will you be requiring your customers to order at least three or four product lines?
Jeff Miller: Jim we see pull through on services consistently I mean that’s part of our value proposition in terms of how we go to work most efficiently from a competitive standpoint I am not going to get into the requirement or where we are in that cycle but we are confident that the package of services that we put to work really work well together particularly as the market gets tighter and busier.
Jim Crandell : Okay, thank you.
 Cowen and Company: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan. Your line is now opened.
David Anderson : No. Thank you. And apologize if I ask a question that might have been answered already as that line dropped off. But there is a question in terms of the capacity of how it’s going to tighter in the market. How much of this do you think is due to seasonally smaller because you guys haven’t had a lot of extra backup on wells and also we have a co-refurbishment cycle which I think is probably starting to kick in. Is that playing a factor in terms of the market tightening up to kind of less than 10% of excess capacity now?
 JPMorgan: No. Thank you. And apologize if I ask a question that might have been answered already as that line dropped off. But there is a question in terms of the capacity of how it’s going to tighter in the market. How much of this do you think is due to seasonally smaller because you guys haven’t had a lot of extra backup on wells and also we have a co-refurbishment cycle which I think is probably starting to kick in. Is that playing a factor in terms of the market tightening up to kind of less than 10% of excess capacity now?
Dave Lesar: Well volume matters a lot, and so our strategy has been to build equipment into the market that handles a lot of volume, and handles the volume more efficiently than competing equipment in the market. So, what we’re seeing it shape up in terms of tightness which is a function of volume, size of jobs that we have described plays right to us. I think that’s -- so anyway it gives us a lots of confidence in the direction both the markets going and where we are.
David Anderson : So do you need less backup capacity on a given well than your competitors? Can you give us some sort of sense as to how much less that would be?
 JPMorgan: So do you need less backup capacity on a given well than your competitors? Can you give us some sort of sense as to how much less that would be?
Dave Lesar: Clearly, less, how much less that kind of depends on the size of the job and where it is and some of those things. But again our whole strategy was around putting equipment that is basically the lowest total cost of ownership and the ability to handle bigger jobs with less back up. And we’re seeing that happen that’s why we’re -- and we described the 20% better efficiency out of our equipment and we’re consistently seeing that work that way.
David Anderson : Okay, a question for Mark on the guidance, so on the third quarter guidance you guided to kind of close to 20% margins in North America in the third quarter. Now if I recall correctly a lot of that’s all coming from the cost side. Is there more to go on the cost side, you see margins picking up and should we start thinking and could we kind of start layering in I know you’re kind of holding off and kind of say in the timing of pricing. But is that kind of next phase as you think about margin progression in North America?
 JPMorgan: Okay, a question for Mark on the guidance, so on the third quarter guidance you guided to kind of close to 20% margins in North America in the third quarter. Now if I recall correctly a lot of that’s all coming from the cost side. Is there more to go on the cost side, you see margins picking up and should we start thinking and could we kind of start layering in I know you’re kind of holding off and kind of say in the timing of pricing. But is that kind of next phase as you think about margin progression in North America?
Mark McCollum: Yes, I think in terms of cost it is. If we look back at sort of the margin progression in Q1 to Q2, there is a little bit of cost, some of that’s cost of goods sold and then commodities as Angie highlighted earlier that we certainly were able to add some share. But when you look back I mean in our analysis it is very much activity driven. Our units out there are working harder and they are sort of a breakpoint that really adds to the margin. We just finished the roll out of the core components of our Battle Red program. It’s now in the field fully deployed. We’re working through the change management of that process now as that stabilizes for the next couple of months. There is going to be additional cost savings that will be added to it. We’re going to continue to work on supply chain and logistics. We all I think across the face of logistics bottlenecks and issues in the early part of Q2 with moving sand where it needed to be. We’ll think as we continue to iron out logistics and add to our infrastructure there. We’re going to be able to continue to drive additional savings. So at least -- we said all along we believe that we could get to close to 20% without the benefit of pricing and that is still the internal goal and we’re driving hard to that and we think that the results of Q2 were a strong step toward that goal.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now opened.
Brad Handler : Thanks and I guess I’ll stay in the Western Hemisphere too. But first in Latin America, have you received the blanket order from Mexico for consulting and project management? I wasn’t quite clear from the comment thus far.
 Jefferies & Company: Thanks and I guess I’ll stay in the Western Hemisphere too. But first in Latin America, have you received the blanket order from Mexico for consulting and project management? I wasn’t quite clear from the comment thus far.
Dave Lesar: So Brad the answer is yes. We did get the blanket order but we didn’t get it in time to be able to book any revenues in Q2. And so now that we have the blanket order in hand the process now is submitting billings that ultimately need to be approved by PEMEX management that ultimately can translate into revenue. So I mean that really was the impact of Q2 that we had to book cost and no ability to book revenues offsetting that even on an unbilled basis. So that we’ve got it now in hand and that’s why we feel fairly confident in our second half guidance around Latin America with regard to that.
Brad Handler : Right assuming -- I guess assuming any kind of normal processing of those -- of your bills?
 Jefferies & Company: Right assuming -- I guess assuming any kind of normal processing of those -- of your bills?
Dave Lesar: That’s right, I mean it’s clearly -- it's still customer dependent. We’re subject to their timing and if they approve those bills on an expeditious manner then we get to book the revenues and have the margin uplift associated with it.
Brad Handler : Okay, make sense. And then if I can come back to the U.S. too I guess we’re also bouncing around some different questions here, but have you experienced in your view do you think you’ve experienced some taking away of work from somebody else because of your distribution capabilities has have others already struggled but getting in the sand in place or some other facet of logistics that do you think you’ve already taken share because of constraints of others?
 Jefferies & Company: Okay, make sense. And then if I can come back to the U.S. too I guess we’re also bouncing around some different questions here, but have you experienced in your view do you think you’ve experienced some taking away of work from somebody else because of your distribution capabilities has have others already struggled but getting in the sand in place or some other facet of logistics that do you think you’ve already taken share because of constraints of others?
Dave Lesar: But we did it at all the time Brad this is -- we rely on our infrastructure we’re very proud of the logistics capability that we have and we really put to work in the second quarter.
Brad Handler : Fair enough. Alright, that’s fine. Thank you very much. That makes sense, thanks.
 Jefferies & Company: Fair enough. Alright, that’s fine. Thank you very much. That makes sense, thanks.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.
Bill Herbert :  Thank you. Good morning. Back to Latin America Mark, high confidence level with regard to your Latin America second half guidance and you’re rationale with regard to the endorsing of the software order makes sense. You also had a stake in however in the press release that “we believe our full year Latin American margin should improve sufficiently to be around the ’13 assuming approval on the billings under the blanket order in Mexico as well as a swift resolution of a retender in the Brazil drilling contract” it doesn’t sound like given you commentary that in fact your Latin American targets for the second half of the year are all that contingent on a resolution or the retender, correct?
 Simmons & Company:  Thank you. Good morning. Back to Latin America Mark, high confidence level with regard to your Latin America second half guidance and you’re rationale with regard to the endorsing of the software order makes sense. You also had a stake in however in the press release that “we believe our full year Latin American margin should improve sufficiently to be around the ’13 assuming approval on the billings under the blanket order in Mexico as well as a swift resolution of a retender in the Brazil drilling contract” it doesn’t sound like given you commentary that in fact your Latin American targets for the second half of the year are all that contingent on a resolution or the retender, correct?
Dave Lesar: No, they are contingent on that as well the -- I mean both issues are there, the Mexico lack inability to build on the blanket order and of course the mobilization cost that we incurred where the larger issues of why the margins were off of Q1. So I think that relative to guidance that we gave at the end of Q1 the blanket order was the culprit that really hurt us in terms of being below what we thought the Latin American business was going to look like in Q2. So as we go to Q3 getting that back certainly helps us. The Brazil retender obviously we’re subject to our customers’ calendar as well on that front, they have a fairly aggressive schedule and so for they’ve been executing against that schedule, we’re hopeful that we can get some relief under that contract expeditiously if for some reason they begin to delay that process that push retender out to the end of the year and again right now I can’t see that but assuming that happened it could have a marginal impact on us later in the year, in the fourth quarter.
Bill Herbert : But the vast majority of the margin bridge for the second half of the year is the combination of the blanket order in Mexico coupled with object inception in Mexico as well?
 Simmons & Company: But the vast majority of the margin bridge for the second half of the year is the combination of the blanket order in Mexico coupled with object inception in Mexico as well?
Dave Lesar:  That’s exactly right.
Bill Herbert :  Okay, great. And then secondly, this is probably a Dave question but maybe not, with regard to -- or Russia, you’ve made some comments here there are some project tenders in the latter part of the year which now -- which could be delayed based upon the possibility of sanctions or just the turmoil that’s underway in the region, could you elaborate on that and what that means? And then moreover if you could remind us kind of what percentage of your revenues are actually derived from Russia these days? Thank you.
 Simmons & Company:  Okay, great. And then secondly, this is probably a Dave question but maybe not, with regard to -- or Russia, you’ve made some comments here there are some project tenders in the latter part of the year which now -- which could be delayed based upon the possibility of sanctions or just the turmoil that’s underway in the region, could you elaborate on that and what that means? And then moreover if you could remind us kind of what percentage of your revenues are actually derived from Russia these days? Thank you.
Dave Lesar:  Yes, thanks Bill. The Russia business for us is the growing business and I think the commentary that you’re describing is more around our outlook if sanctions were to be increased or become more so, currently at least till now the sanctions themselves have had a minimal impact on the business but as we -- as sanctions potentially escalate and the risk of more sanctions sort of looms that's what we believe puts some risk into the business in the back half of the year.
Mark McCollum: I think on your sizing question Bill, this is Mark, I don’t want to give any kind of specifics but I think the Russian business is the low single-digits percentage of our total revenues, company revenues, low single-digits.
Operator:

Jeff Tillery :  Hi, good morning. You mentioned several numbers just around completion size and intensity in the both leading edge I believe ahead of what you’re seeing year-to-date, what are the answers for the industry to just in terms of preparedness is that just greater local storage, and do you see infrastructure as a limit or in terms of the industry actually being able to transition completions to where they want to go over the next 12 months?
 Tudor, Pickering Holt:  Hi, good morning. You mentioned several numbers just around completion size and intensity in the both leading edge I believe ahead of what you’re seeing year-to-date, what are the answers for the industry to just in terms of preparedness is that just greater local storage, and do you see infrastructure as a limit or in terms of the industry actually being able to transition completions to where they want to go over the next 12 months?
Dave Lesar: Yes, thanks. And we were seeing as you described record levels of congestion rather to speak for the industry itself I will speak for Halliburton and so where we spend our time is focused on building out that logistics capability to have access to adequate supplies of both propones and chemicals and there are many elements along that supply chain and we focus on each of them and we also maintain a broad base of suppliers on the sort of the source end of that business so I think the -- from our standpoint the volumes continue to increase, we really think it plays to what we would like to do which is prop into location and then just as importantly have the equipment on location that can handle it and deliver jobs very effectively.
Jeff Tillery :  And the follow-up question has -- it is just around any sort of inflationary pressure as you are seeing here in the U.S. anything at this point where you are not able to recover your cost inflation from the customers even if it’s not matched perfectly in timing and you think that you are stuck with?
 Tudor, Pickering Holt:  And the follow-up question has -- it is just around any sort of inflationary pressure as you are seeing here in the U.S. anything at this point where you are not able to recover your cost inflation from the customers even if it’s not matched perfectly in timing and you think that you are stuck with?
Dave Lesar:  Not at this point, we are able to -- so we have got great visibility into the inflationary pressures, we are -- and because of that I think we have the ability to respond to those quickly and get those in front of our customers.
Jeff Tillery :  Okay, thank you guys.
 Tudor, Pickering Holt:  Okay, thank you guys.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Jim Wicklund :  Good morning guys.
 Credit Suisse:  Good morning guys.
Dave Lesar:  Hi, Jim.
Jim Wicklund : I want to ask a pricing question because the anti-trust but I do want to drill down on something, investors don’t want anybody in the industry adding capacity. If anybody adds capacity it slows down the pricing improvement so some people are going to see your acceleration of capacity adds as a negative. And I just want to ask I would assume that these capacity additions won’t reduce margins it won’t reduce your returns, is that a fair statement?
 Credit Suisse: I want to ask a pricing question because the anti-trust but I do want to drill down on something, investors don’t want anybody in the industry adding capacity. If anybody adds capacity it slows down the pricing improvement so some people are going to see your acceleration of capacity adds as a negative. And I just want to ask I would assume that these capacity additions won’t reduce margins it won’t reduce your returns, is that a fair statement?
Dave Lesar:  That’s a fair statement Jim, I mean we are building to contract and we are building to fair away customers I say fair away players. So, we have got a lot of confidence that our equipment it goes to work in the market.
Jim Wicklund :  Okay, okay I appreciate that that’s going to probably be one of the hottest topics following the conference call is what that’s going to be and I would assume that the 300 billion increase in CapEx would be to a large extent that acceleration of hydraulic horsepower?
 Credit Suisse:  Okay, okay I appreciate that that’s going to probably be one of the hottest topics following the conference call is what that’s going to be and I would assume that the 300 billion increase in CapEx would be to a large extent that acceleration of hydraulic horsepower?
Dave Lesar:  Yes, it is.
Jim Wicklund : Okay, my follow-up if I could, Bill asked it and I will kind of chime in, in the end. The two areas that we are worried about going forward are Iraq and Russia but only if sanctions or violence continues it then reveres -- you guys only have about a $100 million in assets in Iraq how material could that be in the year or two if things get worst than better does that -- would that be enough to drive your earnings down in two years?
 Credit Suisse: Okay, my follow-up if I could, Bill asked it and I will kind of chime in, in the end. The two areas that we are worried about going forward are Iraq and Russia but only if sanctions or violence continues it then reveres -- you guys only have about a $100 million in assets in Iraq how material could that be in the year or two if things get worst than better does that -- would that be enough to drive your earnings down in two years?
Dave Lesar:  Jim, as we look at that market I mean it’s a bit of a unknown over two years time what that could mean what we are seeing happen today are delays and getting contract approvals through the government and the extensions of contract I have to believe that, that rights itself over a period as long as two years because of the importance of hydrocarbons in that markets and to the government et cetera. So, as we look further down the road I mean I can see where this comes right as things settle out if it were to continue to escalate, clearly we have got other places we could move equipment and put it to work even in that very region. So, I think we have got lots of options we just prefer not to exercise them.
Jim Wicklund : Thanks for the clarification guys.
 Credit Suisse: Thanks for the clarification guys.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now opened.
Doug Becker :  Thanks. So, back at the November Analyst Day kind of weighed out the North American target that at some point second half of the year margins would be approaching 20%, activity levels are better than expected at that point in time, the frac market is tighter, you are getting cost recovery, just what’s the market dynamic that keeps from seeing margins above that 20% at that time the target that was weighed out at that time?
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Thanks. So, back at the November Analyst Day kind of weighed out the North American target that at some point second half of the year margins would be approaching 20%, activity levels are better than expected at that point in time, the frac market is tighter, you are getting cost recovery, just what’s the market dynamic that keeps from seeing margins above that 20% at that time the target that was weighed out at that time?
Dave Lesar:  As I hear a tough customer I think it’s ultimately the dynamic largely the fact that there is inflation offsetting a lot of what we are doing to right here, you talked about activity, you talked about the increased -- the ability to pass through but we are constantly as Jeff has alluded to managing logistics challenges we are managing inflation across a number of cost categories and so that really is ultimately is pushing against us. We are continue to navigate through that very effectively and as I have indicated earlier, what we are seeing our largest margin improvement thus far has been on just the share efficiency of running our crudes really stretching out what we can do with these Q10 fleets and what our guys could do in the field every single day it’s a differentiator for Halliburton that we see other people not being able to drag, we are going to continue to push on that until such time as I would say the pricing lock jam breaks.
Doug Becker : And so, may be if I just summarized it, it’s -- yes you are getting cost recovery which is not instantaneous relative to the cost inflation that you are seeing?
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And so, may be if I just summarized it, it’s -- yes you are getting cost recovery which is not instantaneous relative to the cost inflation that you are seeing?
Dave Lesar:  Yes it never is.
Mark McCollum:  It never is. 
Doug Becker :  Okay. And then just a quick clarification the less than 10% excess capacity in horsepower is that before or after what I would call just normal industry friction?
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Okay. And then just a quick clarification the less than 10% excess capacity in horsepower is that before or after what I would call just normal industry friction?
Dave Lesar:  Not sure, what you define is friction Doug…
Doug Becker : It’s just crudes moving in the yard just something that -- there is always some amount of capacity that’s not available even if it truly is in the market?
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: It’s just crudes moving in the yard just something that -- there is always some amount of capacity that’s not available even if it truly is in the market?
Dave Lesar:  Our view is that it probably has some view of that, right. The reason we believe that’s fallen that low is impart sort of twofold. One is, crude sizes have to grow, seems like 20% to 50% in some cases as the equipments working harder, so you have got more equipment in the field per fleet. And the second issue is because it’s working so much harder, there is more in the shop and in the base, being worked on at any one point of time. And so the net, what we are trying to do is get a percentage calculation of what’s available to work and it appears to us that what’s available to work now is less than 10%.
Doug Becker : Perfect, thank you.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Perfect, thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened.
Waqar Syed : Thank you. My question relates to the share buyback program or the expansion that you announced. Mark, are you going to, I mean just to kind of sort of regular share buybacks on a monthly basis or this Dutch auction that you are considering as well as you have done in the past?
 Goldman Sachs: Thank you. My question relates to the share buyback program or the expansion that you announced. Mark, are you going to, I mean just to kind of sort of regular share buybacks on a monthly basis or this Dutch auction that you are considering as well as you have done in the past?
Mark McCollum:  Waqar, there is no limitation as to how we can spend the money that the Board has authorized us to spend, so I wouldn’t necessarily preclude a Dutch auction. I think though that right now it doesn’t feel like that’s the appropriate way to approach the market. We just did one last year. It was debt finance, and so our debt ratio was high. What I am primarily focused on is thinking about how do we deploy access cash, either -- obviously we have an opportunity here for reinvestment in the business that we have been discussing in North America. We have an opportunity all the way for additional M&A transactions similar to what we accomplished in Q2. But to the extent that we are generating more cash flow than we thought we would and that certainly has been the case over the last couple of quarters. And we believe will continue to be the case over the next few quarters. You will see us be in the market doing ratable share purchases until such time as it makes sense, collective sense, financial sense to do something on a larger scale.
Waqar Syed : Okay. And then on Brazil, so retendering certainly positive but when should we expect kind of activity to actually pick up. Is that something that could happen early in ’15 or later in ’15, what’s your view on that?
 Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then on Brazil, so retendering certainly positive but when should we expect kind of activity to actually pick up. Is that something that could happen early in ’15 or later in ’15, what’s your view on that?
Mark McCollum:  Waqar, we don’t see a lot of change in ’15, I mean this could be a ’16 event when we see things, take back up there. There is opportunities for things to be done but I think there is also a lot of sorting out to be done.
Waqar Syed : Okay, great. Thank you very much.
 Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question comes from Chuck Minervino of Susquehanna. Your line is now opened.
Chuck Minervino :  Hi, good morning. Just wanted to go back also to the Analyst Day comments as well and I was hoping you can may be update us on the context of the guidance I believe you gave at that Analyst Day around $6 number for 2016. I also believe they are really heavily dependent on the self help you could do and getting really contemplate this improvement in this North America cycle. So may be clarify for us if you can and then also kind of may be give us some update on how you are thinking, is it possible that that kind of $6 number, I know it could have gone higher, I remember that slide at your Analyst Day. Can we see that $6 kind of run rate sooner than that or that $6 number going higher in ’16 as well may be an update there?
 Susquehanna Financial Group:  Hi, good morning. Just wanted to go back also to the Analyst Day comments as well and I was hoping you can may be update us on the context of the guidance I believe you gave at that Analyst Day around $6 number for 2016. I also believe they are really heavily dependent on the self help you could do and getting really contemplate this improvement in this North America cycle. So may be clarify for us if you can and then also kind of may be give us some update on how you are thinking, is it possible that that kind of $6 number, I know it could have gone higher, I remember that slide at your Analyst Day. Can we see that $6 kind of run rate sooner than that or that $6 number going higher in ’16 as well may be an update there?
Dave Lesar: Chuck, 2016 seems like a long, long time away but I think it’s fair to say six months or so off of our Analyst Day. We are very pleased with the progress that we are making on all fronts and each of our strategy is unconventional, deepwater mature fields. From a financial standpoint, the things that we are being able to accomplish in terms of improving cash flow, we are tracking right along the line, may be a little ahead of where we thought we will be in terms of reducing working capital. And so as I look at it, I think that everything is going exactly the way that we have planned may be a little bit better but don’t necessarily want to get out there right now with the 2016 forecast. But certainly we firmly believe in our strategy both operational as well as financial strategy and we are going to execute against that strategy. We are not going to lever-off of that right now and feel like that certainly it’s being successful in driving us forward.
Chuck Minervino : Okay and then just a couple of quick ones. When you did lay that out, at that particular time did you anticipate having to add pressure pumping capacity or was that kind of planned with, when you laid that out, was that more of using what you had in the field?
 Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay and then just a couple of quick ones. When you did lay that out, at that particular time did you anticipate having to add pressure pumping capacity or was that kind of planned with, when you laid that out, was that more of using what you had in the field?
Jeff Miller: We had always planned to implement the Q10 in fact of the future strategy, so the timing and the pace of that was not as clear certainly a bad time but given the value and the efficiency of the equipment, part of our strategy has always been to put that newer technology to work.
Chuck Minervino :  Alright, thank you very much. 
 Susquehanna Financial Group:  Alright, thank you very much. 
Operator:  Thank you. At this time I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing comment.
Kelly Youngblood: Thank you, Sam. On behalf of the Halliburton management team, I am sorry Dave…
Dave Lesar: Yes Kelly let me just add one last comment to what Jeff said because I think it’s been important one and that, and it goes back to the issue that the question Jim Wicklund had around our market expectations in adding pumping capacity. Of course we’re not going to be crazy enough to add equipment into the market if we see that it’s going to have an impact on our margin expectations from the direction that they’re had it right now. We build to market expectations. We build to the customer base we have. We build to the market share we believe that is efficient to support our business in North America. And we’re also building in a Q10 fleet that we believe is second to none in the marketplace. So as Jeff said all we really are doing is accelerating a bill that we have previously laid out to everybody to get it done faster to take advantage of the efficiencies and the competitive advantage we have from it sooner rather than later. So, I wouldn’t get too exercised about it in my view I think it’s the smart business decision and clearly we wouldn’t do it if we didn’t think it was in the best interest of our shareholders.
Kelly Youngblood: And with that, I’d like to thank everyone for your participation. And Sam I’ll turn it back over to you to close the call.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Halliburton First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton's first quarter 2014 conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the first quarter results is also available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Jeff Miller, COO. I would like to remind our audience that some of today’s comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on our performance. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results, and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our first quarter press release which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of an increase to our reserve related to the Macondo litigation that was taken in the first quarter of 2013 unless otherwise noted. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, everyone. We are going to change up our format this quarter to more effectively communicate the items you've told us you want to hear. I will provide the highlights then Mark will add the financial details that will be followed by Jeff who will give the operations and technology update. So here are my highlights for our first quarter. Results played out about as expected that the earnings mix was a bit different. We had record first quarter total company revenue of $7.3 billion and operating income increased 8% over the first quarter of 2013 as a result of double-digit growth in the Eastern Hemisphere. Now let’s do our outlook by key geographies. Eastern Hemisphere activity continues to expand at a steady rate and is playing out about as expected. Our forecast for the full year remains unchanged. We see customer spending levels increasing by the upper single digits and our revenue growth to be in the low double digits, and we still expect average full-year Eastern Hemisphere margins in the upper teens. Latin America came in slightly better than we projected, but we continue to believe that 2014 will be a transitional year. For the full year, we expect Latin America revenue and profit to be in line with 2013 levels. Longer term we are very optimistic about our position in Latin America and the future growth potential of this market. As Jeff will discuss, we were successful in winning over $3 billion in IPM contracts in Mexico during 2013 and the constitutional changes in Mexico seem to be progressing as planned and we believe the opportunity for foreign investment to come into this market will be very beneficial to our businesses beginning as early as 2015. Turning to North America, as you know, I went through a number of turns in the market and let me tell you, I'm starting to feel the turn. I'm starting to feel the momentum swing not only that, I'm starting to see it happen. I’m more excited about North America now than I have been since late 2011. Now I could be off by a quarter or so, but I do not believe I am wrong about this turn happening. Now why is that? First, the sense of confidence I get when I talk to customers and the sense of confidence they have in their own business prospects. Supportive commodity prices today are translating into stronger cash flow than OpEx budgets for our customers and despite the logistical issues we saw in the first quarter, during March we saw record levels of revenues. Completions intensity is rising, lateral links are increasing, stage counts are rising and the average well volume pumped has increased over 30% just since last year and due to natural attrition, demand growth in the Permian, we believe that excess frac capacity has tightened much faster than expected. And we don't think we'll have any problem filling our frac calendar through the end of the year and believe we will be able to pull-through additional product lines. So how will this play out? First, we will drive efficiency leverage from our low-cost operating model. Second, we will gain incremental revenue from our customer base due to increase job sizes. And thirdly, as a result of tightening supply of equipment we can offset increases in input cost through reimbursement from our customers. And think about it, all of that comes without any help from the natural gas market. So while the first quarter margins were impacted by weather and logistical issues, this will dissipate and North American margins should rebound to second half 2013 levels in the second quarter and we continue to expect North America margins will approach 20% before the end of the year. Based on our continued confidence in our business prospects, we bought back an additional $500 million in shares during the first quarter. We still have $1.2 billion remaining in repurchase authorizations. Along with the buybacks we executed last year, we repurchased about 11% of the company since this time last year, well, also raising our quarterly dividend by 67%. Now I’m going to turn the call over to Mark to provide financial details, but before I do, I want to point out that as you work through Mark's financial commentary, you will see projected earnings per share growth of approximately 25% from Q1 to Q2 and even more increases after that. That is why I am so confident we can continue to deliver industry-leading growth, margins and returns, and continue to return significant cash to our shareholders. Mark?
Mark McCollum: Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with an overview of our first quarter results. In the Eastern Hemisphere revenue and operating income increased by 11% and 16%, respectively, as a result of year-over-year growth in both the Middle East/Asia and Europe, Africa, CIS regions. Sequentially, we experienced a typical decline in revenue and margins during the first quarter due to the absence of seasonally higher year end software and product sales, as well as the normal first quarter weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Russia and Australia. In the Middle East/Asia region both revenue and operating income increased by 13% compared to the prior year. Middle East/Asia is projected to be our highest growth region this year led by Saudi Arabia. In the first quarter Saudi Arabia grew by almost 50% compared to the first quarter of 2013, which clearly demonstrates the success we’ve had in expanding our integrated project capability and our ability to leverage our unconventional leadership and expertise outside of North America. But the improvement was also driven by solid growth across the majority of our Asia-Pacific countries with Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia leading the Pac. Turning to Europe, Africa, CIS, we saw revenue and operating income increased 9% and 21%, respectively, on year-over-year basis. This improvement was led by higher completion tools sales and increased drilling and open-hole wireline activity in Angola. We also posted increased activity in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Algeria. Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 9% and 8%, respectively, compared to the same quarter last year, in large part due to a decline in drilling-related activity in Brazil. Increased unconventional stimulation and cementing activity in Argentina partially offset this decline. We also continued to be impacted by an activity reduction in Mexico related to the cessation of older contracts in anticipation of new integrated projects awarded late last year and early this year. We are currently mobilizing for our Humapa and Mesozoic projects and they should get underway in the second and third quarters. Moving to North America. Revenues were up 5% year-over-year relative to a 1% increase in the U.S. land rig count and operating income was flat. This was a challenging quarter for our North America business. We experienced the coldest winter in 20 years which impacted activity in the Bakken, Niobrara, Marcellus and other operating areas including Canada during the early part of the quarter. Severe weather also disrupted rail movements further reducing efficiency. Pricing contributed lower margins in the quarter as a result of pressure pumping contract renewals that went into effect late in the fourth quarter or early this year. Additionally, we saw rising cost in certain expense categories such as freight and fuel. Our corporate and other expense totaled $89 million this quarter. We invested approximately $15 million in our HALvantage strategic initiatives during the first quarter, a bit lower than we expected. These activities will continue throughout 2014 but the related cost should begin to decline in the second half of the year. We anticipate the impact of these investments will be approximately $0.02 per share after tax in the second quarter. Including these strategic costs, we anticipate that corporate expenses for the second quarter were run approximately $95 million to $100 million. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter also came in slightly lower than expected at approximately 27% due to a tax-basis adjustment. For the remainder of 2014, we’re expecting the effective tax rate to be approximately 28% to 29%. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $934 million, nearly triple the cash flow from the first quarter of 2013. Adjusting for the $500 million in stock repurchases, we generated approximately $300 million in cash during the quarter. As we progressed through 2014, we believe we are well positioned to generate significantly more cash and then our cash flow will grow sustainably in the coming years. As a reminder, we’re working to grow the percentage of cash available for distribution to shareholders up to roughly 35% of our operating cash flows over the next few years, which has nearly doubled our historic average. For the second quarter, we expect our average share count will be approximately 850 million. We continue to expect that our capital expenditures for 2014 will be approximately $3 billion. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.1 billion during 2014. Now moving to the eastern hemisphere outlook. In the second quarter, we’re anticipating a low double-digit percentage improvement in revenue as we recover from the first quarter seasonal drop-off and we expect margins to move solidly into the midteens. Over the course of the year, revenue and margin should continue to progressively stairstep higher with full year margins averaging in the upper teens. In Latin America, we expect for Brazil to be a headwind for the remainder of this year, an average of 24 rigs we’re drilling during the first quarter and activity is expected to remain at this reduced level for the rest of 2014 and into 2015. However, IPM activity is beginning to pick up in Mexico to offset the Brazil slowdown. For the second quarter, we expect a higher single-digit percentage improvement in revenue in Latin America. We believe margins will only be modestly higher than the first quarter, due not only to lower Brazil activity but also to project mobilization cost in Mexico. We expect a more meaningful step up in revenues and margins in the second half of the year. We should bring full year revenue and margins in line with 2013. Concluding with North America, in the second quarter we’re expecting higher U.S. land activity to more than offset the seasonal Canadian spring breakup. The logistics issues we experienced in the first quarter should also abate and we will yield more benefit from our HALvantage initiatives. The net result is that we should see a low to mid-single digit percentage improvement in North America revenue in the second quarter and margins will return to second half 2013 levels. And as Dave commented earlier, we fully expect North America margins will approach 20% before year end.  Now, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff for an operational update. Jeff?
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Mark and good morning, everyone. As you’ve heard, we’re excited about the North America market. We’re confident that we’re going to hit our eastern hemisphere growth expectations. The key point that I want to make today is that our strategies from unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields are working well. Our unconventional strategy continues to focus on driving a lower cost per BOE for our customers. Our discussions with operators about their unconventional assets today are almost entirely centered around how to make more barrels and our strategy is dead focused on just that. Using frac of the future, CYPHER and Custom Chemistry, we’ve consistently demonstrated that we can help operators get more barrels and improve their efficiency. As Dave said, we’re seeing rising servicing intensity across North America and this underscores the importance of our unconventional strategy. Lateral lengths have grown to over 10,000 feet in the market. Stage density has increased by 20% to 25% year-over-year in basins like the Eagle Ford and the Marcellus. And in the Permian basin, the horizontal rig count has crossed over the 50% mark and you know, this is great for us. The net result is that year-over-year we’ve seen average completion volumes per well increase by 30% for our customer set which is driving demand for improved service efficiency at the wellhead. The frac of the future is delivering the increased efficiency we expected, reducing maintenance headcount and the capital required on location. At the end of the first quarter, over 20% of our fleet has been converted to frac of the future. And we have largely completed the HALvantage rollout across our U.S. land operations. And CYPHER is making a difference in helping our customers increased their EURs, telling them where to drill, how to grill quarter, where to complete and how to complete. CYPHER is now gaining traction internationally as well as we deploy the platform to projects in Saudi Arabia, Russia, Argentina and Australia. When it comes to how to complete, the goal is maximum reservoir contact. And this is where our customized chemistry is generating results. One example is AccessFrac. AccessFrac is the system that combines leading-edge unconventional hydraulic fracturing techniques with proprietary diversion chemistry. And the result is substantially better multi-zone completions during plug-and-perf operations. AccessFrac has been used in thousands of stages in every major U.S. basin and in a number of emerging international plays as well. Through successful application, our customers are seeing a production improvement on the order of 20% to 30%. Moving to deepwater. Our outlook has always been one of steady growth, which is precisely what we're seeing play out and our strategy to reduce uncertainty and increase reliability is more important to our clients than ever. As we think about our deepwater strategy, reducing uncertainty for our clients shortens their cycle time and improves their decision making. Our ICE Core fluid analysis technology does exactly that. It performs lab quality fluid analysis, down hole, using spectroscopy and proprietary algorithms. Now this is important to our clients because one logging run can potentially save an operator costly weeks waiting on lab results. Instead oil, gas, water and other fluid composition can be determined during testing operations. And not surprisingly, this unique Halliburton technology is really gaining traction and is gaining traction in every deepwater market in the world. It’s been successfully run in the North Sea, Latin America West Africa and Asia Pacific. We’re also reducing uncertainty with our subsalt reservoir characterization software, GeoShell. GeoShell is part of our leading DecisionSpace 3D Seismic Interpretation software. And it allows our clients do better image salt structures and then therefore map the subsurface more accurately. We’re gaining traction in markets like the deepwater Gulf of Mexico where a large customer is now using GeoShell to improve technical success and reduce exploratory drilling risk. Next, I'm very excited about the pipeline of projects that we see in mature fields. Our discussions with clients are increasingly focused on how to improve mature field production. And these assets are a terrific annuity for our customers whether they may be simple workover or a fulfilled optimization project. And as evidenced of increasing demand, we have over 6 billion in awarded integrated projects and over 25 billion in projects in the perceived pipeline, primarily in mature assets. In Mexico, we have two significant integrated mature field mobilizations underway, the Humapa project in the north and the Mesozoic project in the south. And we expect Humapa to be generating revenue in the second quarter. And with Mesozoic, we are currently preparing the rigs required to deliver these high pressure wells and expect to spud the first well late in the second quarter. This four year project is the largest of the recent mega tender awards and represents over 20% of the recent $4 billion tender round. We expect to be operating at a full run rate in early 2015. And there are two takeaways here. First, we have built the organizational capability to successfully execute large, mature field projects. We have aggressively developed the reservoir skills to increase recovery factors for our customers at a field wide level and have built the service portfolio required to drill, complete and produce mature fields. And second, we're more constructive on Mexico than at the end of last year. And in spite of any near-term transition, it’s clear that the future activity in Mexico is taking shape. In closing, our strategies are working and working well in mature fields, deepwater and unconventionals and we are more confident than ever that we are on track to deliver on our commitments. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?
Dave Lesar: Thanks, Jeff and let me just do a quick wrap up. In summary, Eastern Hemisphere is playing out as we said it would. And based on our contract pipeline, we are confident in our estimates. Latin America will be a transitional year, but our project wins in Mexico set us up for a stronger second half and an improved 2015. And as I said in North America, I can feel and I can see the turn coming, which gives us confidence in our outlook for the year. Overall, our strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. I am optimistic about our ability to grow our North America revenue and margins, realize industry-leading revenue and margin growth in our international businesses, which will result in EPS growth and significantly higher cash generation. We remain focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance and providing industry-leading shareholder returns. Thank you.
Kelly Youngblood: Okay. Sam, we are ready to open up the questions now.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from James West of Barclays. Your line is now opened.
James West - Barclays: Hey. Good morning, guys.
Dave Lesar: Hey, James. Thanks.
James West - Barclays: It’s good to hear your confidence on North America and we were certainly aligned with you there. One quick question on NAM, if we think about, Dave, you mentioned you are getting reimbursables for higher cost, are you also at the point now or getting close to the point where you can get net pricing on the product lines that have been somewhat out of balance here?
Jeff Miller:  Yeah, James. This is Jeff. First thing with respect to pricing, we are not going to discuss our pricing strategy. But if you go back to what Dave said, we have seen some capacity tightening and the ability to pass on some of the increased prices to customers but the point being from our standpoint, we stay focused on returns.
James West - Barclays: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then Jeff or Dave, you mentioned a lot of confidence comes from everything outside of the gas markets. What are you seeing in gas markets today given where gas prices sit and where gas prices could go, given the tightness in the gas market?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, we like -- the short answer is gas. We don’t have it in the plan for 2014.
James West - Barclays: Right.
Jeff Miller: We view sustainable prices north of $450 would be what’s required to see gas move but we are seeing it support, probably cash flows for some clients. But if anything, the key takeaway is it would be a 2015 event.
James West - Barclays: Okay. Okay. Great. I got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now opened.
David Anderson - J.P. Morgan: Thanks. Good morning. So, I just had a question on the pressure pumping pricing comments. Obviously, you guys are pretty fired up. Help us understand kind of how you see this playing out. It sounds like there should be a couple more quarters of seeing contract rollovers kind of pushing pricing down. I was wondering if you could give us little more context as to what you are seeing out there. Is this primarily in the Permian that things are kind of changing around, but just a little bit of more color in terms of how that should play out this year?
Dave Lesar: But we don’t see -- we don’t see pricing pushing down, we described. What we’ve described is contract rollovers through Q4 taking affect now having pricing affect. What I will just reiterate is that we stay focused on returns for our business. The ability to push through the pricing for inputs has been a bit of what we’ve seen. But the vagaries of the tightening, it’s tough to call that at this point. We have seen some tightening.
David Anderson - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Dave, I was just curios on your comments, you talked about kind of seeing the beginnings of another upswing here. You’ve been here before. I was just wondering if you could kind of maybe give us little color in terms of how you are approaching this cycle different from the past. Obviously if you are seeing, if I would have to think some of your smaller competitors are starting to get fired up as well? Are you concerned about capacity coming to the market? Do you start building capacity little bit sooner? I’m just curios, can you help us understand little bit how do you approach this cycle different without obviously giving away the secret sauce and what not?
Dave Lesar: I think, Dave, first of all, I do feel the turn coming, but I want to see it get here first. When it gets here, we will be making those kinds of decisions. I think a couple things to keep in mind. One is, we will continue to high-grade our customer base, as we go through this process, working with the ones that want to work with us to basically get the efficiencies that we need, the rate of returns that we need. We are going to continue to rollout the Q10s, as we said at our Analyst Day. We believe it’s a differentiating platform to go to market with, and we’ll just sort of analyze the market as it comes to us and make those decisions at that point in time. I’m certainly not going to give away our strategy at this point. But I think we're pretty well down the road in thinking about what we're going to do.
David Anderson - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now opened.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Thanks. Good morning. I was a little bit unclear with regard to your commentary on the earnings growth and vision for the second half of the year, following the 25% upswing in the second quarter. Did you call for an additional 25% increase in EPS sequentially in Q3?
Mark McCollum: Bill, this is Mark. We did not call for 25% sequential from Q2 to Q3. I think what Dave was alluding to is that, if you just translate the notion of getting us back to a 20% margins in North America as the year progresses….
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Yes.
Mark McCollum: …as well as the continued strong growth, double-digit growth that we expect in our international or our Eastern Hemisphere markets, that’s going to continue to add to what we think is going to be a good solid Q2 for us, coming off of a Q1 seasonal level.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Understood. And then secondly, in light of the increased service intensity that you're seeing in the business and the increase vigor with regard to the overall business, can you comment a little bit on your capital spending intensity overall? I mean, we’ve gone from call it a, low to mid-teens capital spend rate as a percentage of revenues, the high single digits? And I’m just curious given the runway that you see now. Your restraint with regard to adding horsepower for a considerable period of time, your rollout of frac in the future, how is that all interwoven into your capital spending intensity, your capital allocation with regard to new horsepower going forward?
Mark McCollum:  It's a great question, Bill. And one of the things that we are, as Dave, alluded to, yes, we think about our strategy for looking at North America, where we’re keenly focused on. Clearly, several years ago, we accelerated our capital bit quite dramatically anticipating a fairly dramatic turn in North America coming off the bottom of the financial crisis and then seeing the growth opportunities that were available to us in international markets. We felt like that that was a season of time overall because of our focus on returns. We wanted to get back our spending back down to something that was a more reasonable growth rate and really focus the business on capital utilization, asset turnover and return to our sort of an ultimate focus on returns. As we look at this market today and what maybe happening, I would tell you while we’re still expecting capital expenditures to be $3 billion, I mean, that’s -- I mean, I’ve got a lot of them through sort of keeping a tight grip on the rains in terms of what the opportunity set is out there for the growth of our business. I mean, there is a lot of things that we can do, we’re just -- we’re going to try to maintain that focus on return. So remember one of the things that we also have available to us, as we do the rollout of Q10s and we’re bringing equipment out of the market itself for reclamation or repositioning into international markets is, in essence, gives us some opportunity to sort of spread our assets, improve our utilization overall that maybe some other businesses don’t have within the capital budget.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Thanks very much. That’s helpful.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.
Angie Sedita - UBS:  Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Dave Lesar: Hi, Angie.
Angie Sedita - UBS: I thought it was interesting your comments first on that you’re seeing frac capacity tighten faster than expected, which you would expect to some degree, but can you give us your thoughts on where the markets frac capacity or frac utilization is today? And then thoughts towards the exit rate at the end of the year, given we still are seeing frac efficiencies, moderate activity growth clearly, and some capacity additions, and where we could be on a frac capacity or utilization frac at the end of the year?
Jeff Miller: Hi, Angie, this is Jeff. Certainly as we look out, we’re seeing some tightening, but what I would say about, broadly capacity is that I don’t have any reason to disagree with some of the numbers that you saw last week. So that be.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Okay. So let’s move to Latin America then; on Mexico, your comments certainly were a little bit more positive on the opening of the country and that you could see something as early as 2015, what do you think, what are you hearing that gives you more confidence and more confidence on that timing?
Jeff Miller: Yes. Couple of things. First is the country is making a lot of the right moves. So as we see the reforms sort of taking shape, clearly they are -- I am impressed and pleased to see the schedule sort of keeping pace. Equally important as we see the contract opportunities in the market that works being lit, being tendered and won, which gives me confidence that the base activity, though we see the transitory sort of slow down in the contracts that were in place. We also see the path to the contracts that are going to take their place.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Okay. And then finally the Q10 pumps, based on your remarks it does appear -- it does sound as if you are not making net additions to your horsepower in the U.S., is that fair that you are still actually adding capacity on the Q10 side but retiring or refurbishing all the capacity?
Jeff Miller: I mean, right now, we are sticking to our same policy. We are not going to comment on our overall capacity additions just for competitive reasons.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Okay. I will turn it over.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Dave Lesar: Hey, Jim.
Operator: Jim, please shut your mute button. We will move on to our next question, our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Hey, good morning.
Dave Lesar: Hi, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: I just had a follow-up question. Your forecasting guidance I think speaks to this, but there have been significant investor concerns about the deepwater drilling market and potential utilization declines in conjunction with the prospect for lower international oil company, E&P spending dynamics throughout the course of the year. I know again given the context of your forecast whether or not you can give us some view on IOC spend plans maybe versus NOC or independents and how you see this rolling up into your forecast?
Dave Lesar: Thanks, Kurt. We’ve always called the growth in that market as sort of slow and steady and it’s staying on the pace that we’ve sort of described all along. I won’t comment necessarily on the deepwater drillers, but our view and their view maybe a little bit different around that growth pace. We feel confident about what business that we see sort of over the near term and then clearly contracts that are being left appear to be going to work. So I am confident that from our standpoint, our outlook is still intact and our commitment to outgrow that market by 25% stays intact.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, great. And just follow-up, I had commentary about the North American market capacity tightening and maybe more quickly than anticipated. What do you see is the potential impact on a global standpoint from pricing because typically when North America get tight, it’s pretty good opportunity to improve pricing on the international front as well, and any sense on that prospect as we head out into the rest of 2014?
Dave Lesar: Well, I think as we -- sort of our experience in the last up-cycle following the financial crisis that potential connection doesn’t always work. We continue to believe that, while there are pockets of opportunity to -- or maybe to adjust our pricing with contracts awarded for specific product service lines, the large mega tenders that come out continue to be very, very competitive. And we don’t anticipate that necessarily changing in a slow and steady growth market over time regardless of what happens in the North American market in the short term.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor Pickering. Your line is now open.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering: Hi, good morning.
Dave Lesar: Hey, Jeff.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering: Given some of the volume increases you talked about in North America sort of 30% on a per well basis in your customer mix, can you just talk about the challenges that brings and what you are doing to address it, whether it’d be sand, water, or kind of whatever else on the logistics side?
Dave Lesar: Yes, thanks, Jeff. The increased volumes put a lot of -- not pressure but gives us an opportunity really to use our logistics and infrastructure that we put in place over the last several years. But clearly the ability to deliver the large volumes is crucial to our business and we do that through managing that delivery really from the beginning to the end from the mine to the well side and it’s -- so the takeaway is, yes, we manage it, and yes, we see it as a key component of our advantage.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering: And the second quarter in North America, so seasonally Canada obviously takes a step backward, but could you comment on weather risk and how you see it in kind of northern part of the U.S., whether it be the Bakken breakup or what not, just curious how you see that playing out at this point?
Dave Lesar: Yes, the Canada breakup is always an impact. There is no -- that’s always part of the outlook, but in our case that is part of our outlook that’s included in the commitments that we made for next quarter and then beyond in North America. So we continue to be positive on that and really the takeaway, equipment works harder in the lower 48 than it does in Canada, just given that impact to breakup.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering:  Any thoughts on the Bakken and just given coming off the very cold weather, do we need to expect very, I mean a normal seasonal impact, better or worse, I mean, any thoughts around the Bakken this quarter?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. I mean, Bakken, I think is back to work. So, I mean, it works it’s way through breakup and don’t have any reason to believe that it’s impacted any differently and it was extremely cold winter but that market knows how to rebound.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Sorry, guys, I’m obviously technically challenged on Monday morning.
Dave Lesar: We already knew that.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Yeah. That's no surprise, no surprise. Let me talk about sustainability if I could? Its great picture, excited about the North American market, a lot of people saying don’t forget there was price fixing litigation last year. So it’s good that you can be excited but we understand why you can’t talk details, so that's fine? But it just strikes me and Jeff, your comments about natural gas, but we all kind of know that volumes have to increase overtime? And I am just wondering how do you guys view the sustainability of growth in the North American market? And I would think that you get paid on volume as much as what gas price is, but Dave to your point, you are not increasing volumes much, maybe that's not the case? But can you talk about the broader five-year outlook for North American activity, the sustainability part of it?
Dave Lesar: Yeah. Thanks, Jim. I mean, a lot of the, if we look out five years, a lot of the structural things in my view are happening that that support the sustainable gas market. If we look at LNG export clearly a positive and its moving the right way, if we look at sort of the uptake on gas and its positioning in the market as long-term, fuel for electricity and then we look at sort of the economy and the upside in this economy, all of those conspire to in my view a sustainable gas market.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: And should we expect to see, I mean, I am looking at the consensus numbers for you guys and your biggest competitors, and 8% to 10% revenue growth seems to be sustainable at least through consensus? Is that -- I don’t want to -- you guys are saying the business is no longer cyclical? But to Dave to your point, is this the momentum leading into a two-year cycle or a five-year cycle or do you all have a thought on that?
Dave Lesar: Yeah. Jim, I mean, its clearly in my view more than a two-year cycle, because as I indicated earlier, we are not getting any help from gas essentially at this point in time. And I have a view on gas, I happen to believe that over the next five to 10 years, the gas market is going to be there and potentially be there in a big way. Have you went outside and the [call] (ph) probably has their own view as to whether I am right or wrong there. But I think that what we are trying to indicate is that if you just look at the liquid side of the business right now that's actually what’s giving us our excitement. And so is it sustainable, yes. Duration, yeah, it is still a cyclical business, but I clearly think that we are looking at something that is going to be turning up for more than two years.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Okay. And my follow up if I could. On the mature fields into the business you guys have mentioned several times that you probably have to make some acquisitions to get to where your guidance at your Analyst Meeting was and obviously, those are around pumps of all different kinds and chemistry of all different kinds? Should we expect to see some continuing level of M&A over the next couple years since or could it come in big burst? I am just trying to think of not who you would buy or what you would buy, but how you would go about doing it over the next couple years?
Dave Lesar: Well, I think, the honest answer is, why we would always love to do some big bites. It takes two to tango, right. You’ve got to have those opportunities in front of you and in the absence those opportunities, the way I described our M&A strategy as we play small ball, right. You are going to that's ultimately can win the game and so we are out there constantly keeping our M&A pipeline full of prospects that address the strategic technologies and niches that we want to feel and keep a constant dialogue. Now all of those will come to fruition but enough of those you know along the way are filling up the prospects that can ultimately get us there. We would love to have some bigger deals. We have the balance sheet. We think we have the management team, the ability to integrate in a way that can make that very successful but those have been few and far between.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Cowen. Your line is now open.
Jim Crandell - Cowen: Thank you. Mark, are they any chances of any adjustments to your Brazilian contracts and if the answer to that is, no, when do you expect them to be re-bid and when might that take effect?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. Thanks, Jim. This is Jeff. The answer to question, well, I am not going to comment on the specific discussions with the client, but I am confident that we work through those during the current year. So as we -- some point this year we will see some relief there and certainly going into ’15 it would look different.
Jim Crandell - Cowen: Okay. Secondly, another question about South American country, are you seeing or have any seen any improvement in your receivable situation from PdVSA and have you at all curtailed shipments of product or services to PdVSA because of that?
Mark McCollum: We saw a significant improvement in our receivable position at the end of the fourth quarter. This quarter, it didn’t necessarily improve but I think that was driven probably more by an expansion of our operation there in Venezuela versus lack of payment but still is slower than we would like it to be. We continue to work with our customer there. They are trying to find an arrangement that’s mutually beneficial. But I think that at this point in time we’ll take a long-term view of Venezuela. We’ll continue to be constructive about that market think it can work for us and we’re continuing to invest and operate there to help them achieve their goals.
Jim Crandell - Cowen: Okay, good, Mark. And one final question about two categories of companies and how you see sort of this category of E&P spending, one is the majors we’ve -- I mean, the majors budgets if you add them up are actually slightly lower in 2014 versus ‘13 and they make up about 26% of spending. And then we are also seeing at least in the budgets a significant slowdown coming out of Asia Pacific companies, particularly the NOCs out of China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia. When do you expect that this condition is going to change and if so when do you think it could change?
Mark McCollum: So challenging question, your second part is when it necessarily will change? Again I think that our overall view of the market has been slow and steady. And we have supported commodity prices ultimately when things will change will really relate to the supply and demand balance. Right now, there everything seems to be well and balance and I think as the economic, macroeconomic indicators improve globally, demand will grow then the need for supply will start growing and I think accelerate activity. The first part of the question on IOC and IOC is the part of our overall portfolio. They are an important part but they’re less than 25% as a percentage of our total revenues. I mean, we -- and I would also say that even though their relative budgets have stayed flat, what we see internally that they’ve adjusted some of that spending toward E&P and away from infrastructure this year. So the overall budget totals that they get may not be necessarily indicative of what we see them spending. And we expect that particularly in areas like the Gulf of Mexico that spending will be creeping up as the year goes -- goes by.
Jim Crandell - Cowen: Okay. Thank you, Mark.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Doug Becker - Bank of America: Thanks. I will stick with Latin America. Mark, you’ve mentioned expectations for slightly higher margins in 2Q versus 1Q pretty flat for the full year. What assumptions are you making regarding work in Brazil and the signing of the blanket contract with PEMEX in that guidance? And maybe, if you could help us think about the range of outcomes in terms of margins related to those factors?
Mark McCollum: Okay. Just sort of, I guess, to reiterate the guidance, we are expecting that revenues will be slightly up but that margins will be flat in Q2 but that they will be increasing over the rest of the year so that when you look at the total 2013 -- I'm sorry 2014 year, it will be on balance the same as 2013 was, both from a revenue standpoint and margin standpoint. So that's the overall guidance. So that anticipates a higher margin in the back part of the year than we’re currently experiencing. The forecast that I gave you for Q2 on the blanket contract assumes Q2 more but probably later in the quarter versus earlier. And so it’s large impact will be back half of the year versus for Q2.
Doug Becker - Bank of America: Okay. And with relates -- as it relates to Brazil just that the contracts stays in place as is, is that their underlying assumption?
Dave Lesar: Yes, it is. We have not anticipated any kind of contract reform in Brazil over the course of the year. So if something happens there earlier than toward the end of the year than that would be beneficial for us.
Doug Becker - Bank of America: Got it. And then Dave, you did mentioned that March saw record revenues in North America. Can we get any sense for just how much better March was, whether its in terms of revenue, profitability compared to January and February?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, this is Jeff. I mean there was a solid exit rates and on the basis of that we feel confident about the forecast we’ve laid out for you and also see the path to the commitment that we’ve made for 2014, which was adding the 200 basis points in North America.
Doug Becker - Bank of America: Maybe another way of approaching it, just any quantification of what the weather impact was in North American margins in the first quarter?
Dave Lesar: Maybe to help, when we gave our guidance at the end of the first quarter -- fourth quarter about what would happen in Q1. We highlighted that we expected that there would be some pricing degradation that we had to fight against because of contract rollover as well as weather. And I think that some of the pricing was basically anticipated but I think that the weather and the knock-on impacts of the weather and logistic impacts and stuff like that were not anticipated to be as bad as they were. And so that’s probably, and I guess, as much as I want to give but again looking at March exit rates, they were very strong, very solid and that gives us high confidence for not only just Q2 but the rest of the year.
Doug Becker - Bank of America: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. My question relates to the Middle East. As we look at the margins in the Middle East in the first quarter versus last year's first quarter, they are relatively flat. Could you talk about that given what's going on in Saudi Arabia and UAE, like I would have expected the margins to be year-over-year much better? Is there anything special going on there, is it all Iraq or equipment relocation that's impacting first quarter?
Dave Lesar: Yeah. Thanks, Waqar. The Middle East growth is solid. But don’t forget, we have won a number of projects in the Middle East then we’re mobilizing for those, including in Saudi Arabia. And so what you’re seeing is some of the sorting out of that activity. That said, the takeaway is we are very confident about the business in the Middle East and expect to see strengthening there.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Could we -- where could the margins in the Middle East head to? I know you've given guidance for all of Eastern Hemisphere. But just looking at Middle East on its own, any guidance in terms of revenues and margins for not just 2014, maybe longer term as well?
Dave Lesar: Waqar, we are not going to provide any guidance specifically on the Middle East. Middle East/Asia is our reportable region. If you look at it, it tends to be, have higher margins and we anticipate it will have higher growth than the average of Eastern Hemisphere overall but otherwise, we are going to stay with our Eastern Hemisphere guidance.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: Okay. We’ve heard from some of your peers saying that like rig count growth could be 17%, 18% in the Middle East area. Is that your thinking as well?
Dave Lesar: We have no reason to dispute their estimates on rig count growth as well.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs : Okay. And just one finally on the labor, we hear that labor is pretty tight, not just in Permian but other places too. Do you see that having any impact on work or the industry’s ability to perform work this year?
Dave Lesar: No. I mean, this is really where we’ve build the machine. It’s able to hire people. We know how to do that. We’ve seen this sort of tightness in labor before. So, we may see some increased costs but the ability to execute and deliver the people, I’m quite confident that we will do that.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Dave Lesar: Sam, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Yes, sir. Our final question comes from Scott Gruber of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now opened.
Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein: Thanks for squeezing me in. Dave or Jeff, have you started to see a turn in the appetite for shale technology, particularly by the domestic E&Ps? Just from a 20,000 foot level, it appears that the domestic industry is just running so hard right now, that customers are simply demanding more and more of the conventional services. But obviously you have a much more detailed perspective than we do, so wanted to see if you're starting to sense a turn in that mentality?
Jeff Miller: Yeah. This is Jeff. There is a strong appetite for better technology and that’s really the crux for most of the conversations, I have with customers today is around how to make more barrels and what technology will allow them to do that. And that's really what our CYPHER suite is all about, is how to frac and how to drill to make more barrels. And so that’s where we’re seeing that increase in appetite so. And that’s really across the piece. So the takeaway is yes, there is more activity but every application of better technology in that higher volume environment is able to even make, create more value for our customers.
Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein: And do you think that's a product of where we stand with the evolution of shale, more in the development phase today? Is it a product of the tightness -- emerging tightness for people and equipment, if you can comment on any change in your sales strategy and whether that's having an impact as well? 
Dave Lesar: Well, let me comment on this place. We are in the cycle and clearly as the client goes into development, there is such a premium on making more barrels out of that existing asset that I think that’s driving some of that appetite. I won't comment on our sales strategy necessarily other than to say, we really like the suite of tools that we have in the marketplace right now and the benefit that it’s delivering for our customers.
Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, I’d like to turn the call back to management for any closing comments.
Kelly Youngblood: Okay, Sam. I think we’re ready to close the call. I just want to thank everybody on behalf of the management team for participating today. You can go ahead and close the call.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I’d now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Thank you, Sam. Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton's fourth quarter 2013 conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the fourth quarter results is also available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO, Jeff Miller, COO, and Mark McCollum, CFO. I’d like to remind our audience that some of today’s comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, Form 10-Q for the quarter-ended September 30, 2013, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter press release which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the financial impact of the fourth quarter charges related to employee severance and other restructuring charges during the quarter of $28 million after-tax or $0.03 per diluted share and the third quarter charges related to employee severance and other restructuring charges during that quarter of $38 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share unless otherwise noted. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2013. First, I’m very proud to say that we delivered industry leading international revenue growth in 2013, specifically for the full year our Eastern Hemisphere grew a remarkable 17% with profit growth of 23%. That coupled with a solid year in North America resulted in a record year for the Company with revenue totaling $29.4 billion. We also set new revenue records this year in all of our international regions and in both of our divisions. From an operating income perspective we achieved new full year records in our Middle East, Asia region and in six of our 13 product lines. I want to express my gratitude to our 77,000 employees around the globe for their hard work and dedication that helped us deliver these outstanding results. In 2013 we also demonstrated our strong commitment to delivering superior shareholder returns. We repurchased approximately $4.4 billion or 10% of our outstanding shares. We had also increased our dividend twice during the year for a total payout increase of 67% over our 2012 dividend rate. These actions reflect our continued confidence in the strength of our business outlook. We have been and will continue to be relentlessly focused on delivering consistent execution and best-in-class returns. Our strategy has worked well for us and we intend to stay the course. The cornerstones of our strategy remain unchanged, expanding our share within the deepwater market, helping our customers maximize recovery from mature fields and leading in global unconventional development. We believe that these are sustainable growth segments for Halliburton which will allow us to generate superior revenue growth, margins and returns. So I think we had a really good year given what the market gave us. Now before we delve deeper into the fourth quarter, I think I should cut right to the chase and look at how we believe 2014 will play out. I think that will help provide you with some context for the rest of today’s discussion. So let’s start with our 2014 view for all of Halliburton Company. Let me begin by saying that we’re very optimistic about the coming year and our ability to achieve robust revenue and operating income growth for the total company. As we look at the 2014 landscape today, we see the following. Based on customer surveys and some discussions with customers, we see total customer drilling and completion spending increasing by the mid to upper single digit percentages with higher spending percentage increases in the Eastern Hemisphere and a bit lower in North America. However, from Halliburton revenue standpoint, we believe we will outpace the market rate of spending increases in both the Eastern Hemisphere and North America and revenue growth for the full year could approach double-digits. We also believe that overall margins will take a step higher both in Eastern Hemisphere and North America. These expectations provide to framework for our current 2014 operating plan, which reflects continued superior returns, significant higher cash generations, and solid double-digit growth in earnings per share. Now let me do a little bit deeper dive into our outlook and the major market segments. In the Eastern Hemisphere for 2014 we anticipate customer spend to be largely driven by our NOC customers. With the contracts we have in hand, we’re planning on low double-digit revenue growth for the Hemisphere led by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, China and Australia and our Middle East and Asia businesses, and by Russia and Angola and our Europe, Africa, CIS region. We also anticipate 2014 Eastern Hemisphere margins to take a step higher quarter-over-quarter when compared to 2013, approaching 20% by year-end and averaging in the upper teens for the year. In 2013, North America played out as we predicted. We saw market driven by increased drilling and completion efficiencies with a relatively flat overall rig count and industry overcapacity. The volatility of the past few years is evolved into a more stable market environment. In the fourth quarter of 2012, if you recall, we called the bottom on our North America margins and we were right. We've seen a marked improvement in margins since that time. For 2014 we are now forecasting U.S. spending to increase in the mid-single digit range based on recent moderations in liquids pricing outlook. Of course, we naturally believe our growth rates will exceed that increase in customer spend, given our strong position in North America. On the margin front for North America, we believe that over the course of the year, we will see our margins increase about 200 basis points. We expect the U.S. land rig count to modestly increase in 2014, driven primarily by the continued shift to horizontals in the Permian basin. The Permian started 2013 with less than 35% of the rig count running horizontal, but we anticipate more than half the rig count will be horizontal by the end of 2014. We also expect to see a continued trend in higher well efficiencies due to increased pad drilling, more 24-hour operations, rig fleet upgrades and significant advancements in drilling and completion technologies. In 2013 we saw average drilling days per horizontal well drop by approximately 14% compared to 2012 and we anticipate horizontal drilling efficiencies to again improve in the mid to upper single digits in 2014. Storage levels are back near the five-year average, but production levels remained elevated both with associated gas in the liquids plays as well as some continued robust activity in the Marcellus basin. Continued strength in natural gas prices could provide some upside potential, but we are not optimistic there will be a meaningful uptick in gas activities in the near term. With regards to Latin America, we expect 2014 to be a challenging year, with fairly steady activity in all countries, expect Mexico and Brazil, both of which are in transition. As previously communicated, Brazil deepwater drilling activity levels have been both expectations and our expected to be even worst throughout 2014. Petrobras has recently said the deepwater rig count for 2014 will be even less than the already depressed levels of 2013. The entire services industry in Brazil is looking for relief to the over capitalization as that has occurred there in anticipation of a much higher deepwater rig count. No relief has been forthcoming at this point. We have an excellent long-term contract position in Brazil and I still believe it will pay off in the long run, but for now the depreciation and personnel costs of our high capital investment is having a severe downward pressure on Brazil margins. However, we intend to stay the course and with Petrobras to try to gain some relief over the next several quarters. In Mexico, reduced activity levels on land are expected to continue through the first half of 2014, as we transition from our prior South Alliance 2 projects to already identified new opportunities in the country. Last quarter we announced the win of the largest incentivized project contract called Humapa, and I am pleased to say today that based on the preliminary tender results, we are also positioned to win Mesozoic 1, the largest of the integrated mega tender projects. These large contract wins will result in higher revenues in Mexico, but the mobilization for them will take some time. In the meantime, I've made the decision to not reduce our headcount or support costs as these resources will soon be needed on these projects, hopefully by the third quarter. Therefore, this ongoing cost will go directly against our profitability until the revenue stream starts back up. In addition, last year, PEMEX pushed the annual software and consulting blanket order approval process back further into the year, delaying their release until its third and fourth quarters. While it is difficult to predict whether this typical approval process is the new norm, we do know that we will be expanding our consulting work with PEMEX in 2014 and beyond. This could result in us incurring costs that will directly hit our process until the blanket order is signed and revenue can be recognized. Both of these items are transitory in nature, but will clearly lay in our profitability in Mexico for probably the first six months of 2014. And while this is not an optimal outcome, I do strongly believe this approach is in the best interest of our company for the long-term success of our business in Mexico, a market we believe has long-term sustainable value to us. So we are strongly committed to both Mexico and Brazil through this transition period. We believe these issues are short-term bumps on the road, but because of their margins for the Latin America region, we'll likely be in the upward single digits until activity begins to recover in the back half of the year. Over the long-term though, Latin America is expected to an outstanding growth market for us and Jeff will give you some details on that in a bit. So overall our strategy is working well. We intend to stay the course in the coming year. I am optimistic about our ability to grow North American revenue and margins, realize industry leading revenue and margin growth in our international business, which should result in double-digit EPS growth. We also remain focused on consistent execution, superior financial performance and industry-leading returns. Now let me turn the call over to Jeff and he'll give you some operational details.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results. Overall, I'm pleased with our operational results. Total company revenue of 7.6 billion was a record quarter for Halliburton with operating income of 1.2 billion. We achieved record revenues this quarter in our completion tools, multi-chem landmark, wireline and perforating and testing product lines. During the quarter, our landmark and testing product lines also set new operating income records. Turning to the geographies, our Eastern Hemisphere has record revenue for the quarter with 14% year-over-year growth, while operating income grew 10% for the same period. Sequentially, East Hemisphere revenue and operating income improved 8% and 14%, respectively, driven by our Middle East Asia region. Relative to the third quarter, Europe, Africa, CIS grew by 4% with slightly higher operating income despite some modest weather issues in the North Sea. The UK led the improvement with increased drilling and offshore wireline activity. Also contributing to the growth was increased stimulation in Boots & Coots activity in Algeria and seasonally higher year-end software sales in Russia and throughout Continental Europe. Partially offsetting the growth was lower drilling and wireline activity in Egypt. In Angola, we performed our first pre-salt deepwater open-hole logging jobs in the country on two wells for Cobalt International. Our open-hole wireline logging suite of tools including nuclear magnetic resonance, imaging, coring, seismic and reservoir formation pressure testing and sampling services delivered high quality petrophysical, geophysical and reservoir information for our customer. We also used our ICE Core fluid analysis technology which debuted in the fourth quarter. We continue to build customer confidence in our technology and formation evaluation capability through jobs like this, and the recent successes logging deepwater discovery wells elsewhere in Africa. In the Middle East Asia region, compared to the prior quarter, revenue and operating income grew by 12% and 28%, respectively. Seasonal year-end software and equipment sales led the improvement for the quarter followed by higher stimulation activity in Australia and increased drilling activity in Malaysia and Thailand. In Indonesia, we received two major project wins in the quarter. The first is a three-year project management win valued at over $200 million to oversee the drilling, logging and testing of challenging high pressure, high temperature geothermal wells. This is the testimony to Halliburton's unique leadership in delivering high pressure, high temperature solutions. The second win is a series of contracts to provide directional drilling, wireline and completion services in a multi-field deepwater project over five years. This is expected to be the largest development today in Indonesia. Also during the quarter, Halliburton successfully completed the first -- the industries first fully acoustic telemetry controlled and monitored deepwater drill stem test. Using our DynaLink Wireless Telemetry System, we send acoustic control signals down hole operating the well test valves and fluid sampling system while also receiving real time reservoir data at surface. The enhanced flexibility and control during this operation saved our customer five rig days. This advancement along with deepwater contract wins in Indonesia and Angola reflect our leading global completions position and our evolution towards becoming a compelling choice for deepwater drilling and evaluation services. As we deploy new technologies into the Eastern Hemisphere we’re seeing strategic upsell opportunities within our existing contracts and have been able to increase pricing accordingly with new contracts. Turning to Latin America; revenue and operating income were essentially flat compared to the third quarter. This is the net result of higher yearend software sales, increased cementing activity and the recognition of a value added tax refund receivable in Brazil which offset a decline in activity related to our Mexico Southern Alliance 2 contract. As discussed on our last earnings call activity levels on the Southern Alliance 2 project has declined meaningfully as PEMEX ramps down the ongoing IPM work in preparation for the mega tender projects. We averaged only three rigs for the Southern Alliance 2 project during the fourth quarter as compared to seven rig average in the third quarter. Further we expect to average two rigs on those project in the first half of 2014. Looking at the Mexico mega tenders, the number of projects tendered dropped from 8 to 10 resulting in only three ATG projects in Northern Mexico plus the original five projects in the south. The remaining ATG projects were also smaller in scope than initially expected. Based on the preliminary results of the bid opening, we are positioned to be awarded work in the Mesozoic, the largest single contract in the mega tender round. The ATG and tertiary projects are the least technically challenging of the tenders and have the highest number of submitted bids. Who would not have been interested in doing these projects at the pricing we saw it took to win them. The Mesozoic work by contrast has extremely complex geology resulting in fewer qualified bidders and will likely result in better margins and returns. As we said before, we are very selective on the integrated projects that we pursue. As a return’s driven organization, we’re only interested in winning work that generates superior margins and returns. We believe that the Mesozoic project and the Humapa contract that will begin in the second quarter that’s squarely in this economic profile. We look forward to the formal award of the mega tenders in the first quarter, mobilization to begin in the second and in full activity levels in the back half of 2014. And in Brazil as Dave said, we saw a significant reduction in drilling activity over the course of 2013. We believe that 2014 will be a very challenging year for Latin America. The uncertainty around the timing of when we will be able to right-size our cost structure in Brazil coupled with the delays to the submission of the mega tenders in Mexico have meet our growth expectations for 2014. Ultimately however this does not change our long-term outlook for Latin America. The transition to the mega tenders in Mexico in conjunction with the start up of our incentivized Humapa contract gives us confidence that activity levels in Mexico will recover as these areas get underway. And in Brazil although drilling activity could continue to decline in the near term, our recent contract wins have a potential term of up to eight years and we believe higher drilling activity levels will resume. Over the long-term we expect both of these countries to continue to be strong contributors to our growth and profitability. Switching to North America, weather related activity disruptions resulted in sequential drop in both revenue and operating income. However activity levels were stronger than expected during the holiday season which helped to minimize that sequential decline. We executed our highest U.S. base count of the year in the month of October and activity levels remain strong throughout most of September before declining during the holidays. Several areas including the Bakken, Permian Basin and Marcellus got off to a slow start in January due to weather disruptions, but activity levels have since resent. We expect first quarter activity levels to be similar to the fourth quarter as our completions calendar is looking very active over the coming months; however this outlook is subject to additional weather delays notably end markets like the Rockies where we have a large market share of position. In addition, we also renewed a number of long-term contracts in the fourth quarter with price concessions that will take effect during the first quarter. Looking ahead our customers continue to focus on horizontal drilling efficiency and multi-well pad operations. Pad wells account for over half our activity today and even in the Permian the last area to shift the horizontal drilling, pad activity is estimated to be over 20% in both the Midland and Delaware Basins. These market conditions underscore the need for our HALvantage initiatives. As you know HALvantage includes Frac of the Future and Battle Red as well as other strategic cost oriented programs. We continue to deploy Q10’s and SandCastle’s into the market and expect to see our fleet cross the 20% mark in the first quarter. The Battle Red program meanwhile is expected to be deployed into over half of our North American operations by the end of the first quarter including the frontline smartphone technology. Once we have a couple of quarters behind this, we intend to provide a more in-depth assessment of the HALvantage rollout. At this time I’d like to give you an update on CYPHER; our Seismic-to-Stimulation Service. CYPHER was launched publicly in the fourth quarter and today we have over two dozen programs running for a number of customers across the major basins. In November we summarized the results of our early tests where we averaged over 20% improvement in production in North America. Today I would like to highlight one of our pilot projects which recently completed its first year. Our customer had a series of underperforming wells in a Barnett asset and Halliburton was engaged to invigorate its program. The first step was to build an earth model from existing seismic, log and core data as well as production results. This phase identified a number of sweet spots including several that have been bypassed in the initial well placement. By understanding where to drill and where to land the wells, the second phase yielded over a 50% uplift and estimated ultimate recovery or EUR per well, and the average CYPHER well produced at a level beyond the best pre existing wells. Our next step was maximizing fracture complexity and production. With each iterative well, the CYPHER service was using Halliburton’s proprietary complex fracture model to learn where to complete the well and then how to complete the well. By the conclusion of the third phase CYPHER had more than doubled the average EUR per well. One year later CYPHER has clearly demonstrated its value. Through the smart service we’re working with the client to continuously incorporate new technology and techniques to improve production not only in this asset but on several others. We believe that CYPHER is a game changer for our customers and for Halliburton. We will change the way we go to market and will significantly differentiate us in the North American frac market. We’re also seeing a consistent adoption of our Custom Chemistry Solutions, including our RockPerm service and it's associated OilPerm Formation Mobility Modifiers. Through RockPerm we demonstrate to our customers how a customized affected package including OilPerm can generate appreciable production improvements compared to offset wells. Since beginning field trials in the second quarter of 2013, Halliburton has utilized RockPerm and OilPerm on over 2000 jobs. Moving to the Gulf of Mexico, we saw sequential revenue and profit improvement from increased drilling activity and the return of one of our larger simulation vessels to service. Going into 2014, we believe we are well positioned with drilling and evaluation of services for the additional 14 to 16 deepwater rigs that are scheduled to arrive during the year. We are also optimistic about the higher levels of completion sales during 2014 given our strong market position in both deepwater and lower tertiary completions. To close out North America, we believe the current environment continues to favor Halliburton. There are two key differentiators with our customers today; efficient, reliable execution and improved production. We believe these trends play the Halliburton strengths as the leading service provider in North America and that our HALvantage and CYPHER initiatives give us a clear competitive advantage. Based on early signals from our customers, we're optimistic about the activity outlook for 2014 and we'll continue to be relentlessly focused on our cost structure to enable margin growth in the coming year. Internationally, we're very pleased with our year-over-year growth in spite of activity headwinds in Latin America. We've led our peer group in delivering international revenue growth and expect to continue to expand our global business in 2014. We believe that continued above-market rate growth will be driven by recent wins and new projects, markets where we've made strategic investments from the introduction of new technology and from modest pricing increases and cost recovery on select contracts. Now Mark will provide some additional financial commentary. Mark?
Mark McCollum: Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. As mentioned last quarter, we've been evaluating our cost structure within the organization as we deploy our HALvantage corporate initiatives. These initiatives are having a significant impact on the support and operational headcount needs primarily in North America, as well as equipment and inventory requirements. During the fourth quarter, as we progressed with the rollout of these initiatives, we took further restructuring actions which resulted in severance and other charges during the quarter of approximately $38 million before tax. Our corporate and other expense totaled $99 million this quarter and included approximately $22 million for continued investment in these HALvantage strategic initiatives. These activities will continue throughout 2014, but the related costs should begin to decline in the second half of the year. We anticipate the impact of these investments will again be approximately $0.02 per share after tax in the first quarter. Including these strategic costs, we anticipate that corporate expenses for the first quarter will be in line with the fourth quarter of 2013. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter came in lower than anticipated at 26% due to some favorable tax items in Latin America, but our tax rate does continue to fall as our international taxable earnings continue to grow. As we go forward into 2014, we're expecting the first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 29% which is about 100 basis points than our normalized rate as we exit 2013. This is driven solely by the exploration of the federal research and experimentation tax credit, which we hope will be reapproved by Congress sometime in 2014. Cash flows from operating activities in 2013 were approximately $4.4 billion, representing growth of 22% compared to the prior year. We also generated approximately $1.3 billion in cash adjusted for stock repurchases and a new debt we issued last year. And moving in 2014, we believe we're well positioned to generate significantly more cash and that it will grow sustainably in the coming years. We have previously committed to grow the percentage of cash available for distribution to shareholders up to roughly 35% of our operating cash flows over the next few years, which has nearly doubled our historic trend. And based on our 2013 results, we're well on our way toward achieving this goal. We anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2014 will be approximately $3 billion which is generally consistent with our 2013 spending level. We expect our international spend to continue to outweigh our North America's spend in 2014. We also expect our 2014 depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.2 billion. During the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors approved the 20% increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.125 to $0.15 per share. This was the second dividend increase in 2013 representing a cumulative 67% increase over our quarterly dividend rate in 2012. As announced earlier in 2013, our intention going forward is for our dividend payout to equal at least 15% to 20% of our net income. Additionally, we currently have approximately $1.7 billion in share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors that is available to use for stock buybacks. As we moved into 2014, we're anticipating a seasonal sequential decline in international revenue and margins during the first quarter, due to reduced software and equipment sales as well as weather-related weakness in the North Sea, Eurasia and Australia. On a year-over-year basis for the first quarter, we anticipate an upper single digit percentage increase in the Eastern Hemisphere revenue with the modest improvement in margins which is evidence of our expanding international market position. Beginning in the second quarter, we expect Eastern Hemisphere activity levels to recover from the seasonal impact and margins to steadily improve over the course of the year with full year margins averaging in the upper teens. For the Latin America, we expect a seasonal decline in first quarter revenue and margins to be more severe than normal, due to our elevated cost structure in Brazil and the ramp down of the Mexico Southern Alliance 2 project as Jeff discussed a little bit ago. Also, as Dave discussed, the sequential decline is also exacerbated by the timing of our annual consulting blanket order renewal in Mexico. We're currently expecting a mid teens sequential decline in revenue in the first quarter and margins in Latin America to be in the upper single digits. At this time it's difficult to provide full year guidance for Latin America until we hear the outcome of the negotiations with our customer in Brazil and receive formal contract awards in Mexico. Concluding with North America, we're anticipating a typical weather impact in the first quarter plus some additional pricing pressure for contract renewals that went into effect at the beginning of 2014. Subject to severe weather disruptions, we're currently expecting first quarter revenue and margins in North America to be in line with the fourth quarter of 2013. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing comments.
Dave Lesar: Thanks, Mark. Just in a quick summary, we executed very well in 2013. I believe we had a good year with what the market gave us and delivered what we said we would. Bottom line for 2014 is we expect all of this to translate into double-digit EPS growth. So with that, let's turn it over to questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now opened.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Good morning, gentlemen.
Dave Lesar: Good morning, Jim.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Remind to write-off Latin America as my vacation spot for this year. The CapEx that you guys have spent over the last couple of years, primarily in the Eastern Hemisphere setting up locations, et cetera, that we kind of looked at as some costs, are we going to see an improvement in performance on the basis of that this year? Does that kick-in on a noticeable basis this year, the ability to win projects on more of a variable basis than a fully move into the country for the first-time basis?
Dave Lesar: Yes, we should start seeing that Jim. The initial investment was to get placed in and at this point now that we have the facilities build out, we are – the incremental projects that come along are being bid at sort of the rates that we would expect to recover. And then as we absorb those costs with additional work, again we'll continue to see the improvement in margins.
Mark McCollum: Part of that, Jim, is why I think we're so confident that Eastern Hemisphere is going to continue to step-up quarter-over-quarter in its margin realizations because to some extent you are now covering those fixed costs with a wider contract base.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Guys, I just think that's a story that people kind of forget that that's one of the drivers. Okay, and second if I could, record revenues in the entire Eastern Hemisphere, usually if I'm head of Eastern Hemisphere, Dave, and you ask me what am I going to do this year, and me saying, I hope customers spend more, probably doesn't get me a promotion. When you're operating at record revenue level in order to increase returns, don't you have to at some level take some additional risk?
Dave Lesar: Well, I'm not sure what you mean by risk, but let me take a shot at this. I mean obviously our Eastern Hemisphere is doing well and Joe Rainey who heads that up and his management team, are doing a fantastic job for us. I think really to continue to grow Eastern Hemisphere, one obviously you have to take what the market gives you. And we're seeing some sort of modest level increase in rig count there. So that will help grow the revenue. You have to win more than your normal market share which I believe we’re doing in terms of tender and contract win rates. I’m not sure you necessarily have to take higher risks in your contract pricing. You really have to pick and choose your spots and we have as we said when we responded to the first question we also have a larger footprint in the Eastern Hemisphere now to attack the market off of. So I don’t necessarily think we have to take risk to continue to grow our Eastern Hemisphere business, I think we’re well positioned there. It’s a contract base. We have a great footprint, we have a great management team and I think that will all drive the revenues higher.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Okay. Gentlemen, thank you very much.
Dave Lesar: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Dave Lesar: Good morning, Brad.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company: Maybe I could ask you to as you think about ’14 for us, just cut up the business a couple of different ways that you have done so in the past. How would you look at offshore growth internationally or maybe in the Eastern Hemisphere versus onshore growth? It just -- it sounds like a lot of the opportunities you identified were actually onshore or onshore driven for ’14?
Dave Lesar: I think it’s a healthy mix of both Brad. The offshore rig count we see that continuing to grow and obviously one of our clear strategies is to outgrow the deepwater market which we expect to do, but yes there are number of onshore opportunities as well. We think about Russia and China and then certainly the Middle East. So there is a robust onshore market out there. So I think that they’re evenly weighted and I wouldn’t take one over the other.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company: I mean when you clearly think about the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico should have a good solid growth here on 2014. Now we did say them at Brazil likely is going to be flat slightly down and that is somewhat of a disappointment and sees 2015 being more of a transition year. But you step away from Brazil, the rest of it -- that offshore market should be good?
Dave Lesar: Yes.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company: Okay, all right. That’s helpful color. Asking a similar question, but slightly different than your -- as you’ve identified your Brownfield strategy which I know is a multi-year strategy, but how does that in your minds grow in ’14 versus more traditional sort of Greenfield drilling and completion work?
Dave Lesar: Well, we see the first step out in Mexico. So as we get into 2014, we see Humapa getting ramped up and so we will see contributions there. We are selective around these projects as we take them. We expect to add a few projects per year. Clearly, Humapa being one of those and we have got a number of other sort of things in the works. So expect that to start contributing this year.
Mark McCollum: I think let me also sort of respond from a capital investment standpoint. We are going to be putting more capital in 2014 into our businesses that orient towards the mature fields strategy both the chemicals, artificial lift and expanding our footprint there both in North America and around the world and then continue to build out tools and other equipment to support what we see as a coming Brownfield opportunity in North America.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company: That’s helpful. If I may, within that I think you identified -- within the Brownfield strategy, I think you identified a couple of offshore opportunities for example offshore Norway. Do you see those as progressing? On other words, is ICO spending in some meaningful way shifting to production enhancement? Is that generating some incremental opportunity for you as you tender today?
Dave Lesar: Yes, we see some of that though I would say it’s probably more focused with the national oil companies than it is the IOC. So it’s given kind of the type of investment profile I believe that they have. There are some offshore opportunities, but in terms of the kind of consolidated or we manage all of the activities, those types of things, those are less focused offshore and certainly more focused onshore.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from of Doug Becker of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. I want to clarify the North American revenue guidance a little bit. In the press release you mentioned mid single-digit growth, in the prepared remarks talking about spending in mid single-digits and that you generally outperform underlying spending. I just want to reconcile those comments for North American revenue growth?
Dave Lesar: Yes, this is Dave. Let me take that -- let me sort of attack it a couple of ways. One is that when we look at sort of what our customers are saying about spending in 2014, you sort of settle in the mid single-digit range. If you look at sort of where we believe the rate count is going, which is up a little, if you look at well count efficiencies which will be up in sort of the mid, maybe upper single-digits and then you can drive revenues sort of off of either of those. I think the important point is that we believe our revenue because of our position in North America it’s going to exceed whatever the market gives us. But we have -- all we can do at this point is gauge off what our customers are telling us they’re going to spend and what they say is sort of the mid single-digits. As I said we will beat that because of our position. We know the rate count will go up a little. We know that efficiency is going to be better. All of that bodes well for us, but we’re just trying to give you a number of data points by which you can then plug in your own growth expectations and then just add some on top of that for what you think will do.
Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So you wouldn’t be balking at say 7% to 9% revenue growth figure?
Dave Lesar:
let you pin me down:
Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Fair enough. Another one, I appreciate the difficulty in looking at Latin America growth for the full year. Are you able to give us some perspective of if there is a relief in Brazil, if the latest award or expected award actually starts ramping up in the second half. Are you able to just give some rough gauge about how big a deal those two instances could be for revenue and margins?
Mark McCollum: Yes.
Dave Lesar: Go ahead.
Mark McCollum: Yes, the -- not calling anything on the first half of the year, but if you look at the full year, those are meaningful projects in Mexico. So there is some upside in terms of growth for the full year, but we need to see those get started and work being done on those. But again we will know a lot more about this as we get further into the year.
Dave Lesar: The way I would probably also add to that is that as I think about the year, the revenue growth number is very difficult to pin. Clearly we talk about Brazil being lower, Mexico may have a late ramp in revenues, but what it does really make a difference in is for our margins, and -- we typically would like to talk about our international margins being in the upper teens and -- but Eastern Hemisphere is clearly on its way. I see some relief on the cost pressure of Brazil and Mexico activities beginning to solidify going forward. It gives us the opportunity to get our margins in Latin America back on track with the rest of the international markets and drive up in those upper teens.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Thanks, good morning. I was wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the PEMEX mega tender a little bit. You said it was reduced from 10 down to 8. I’m just kind of curious what do you think the rationale was? Where those maybe the five ATG projects? I didn’t quite hear you on kind of how you articulated that.
Dave Lesar: Yes, initially there were 10 mega tender projects that were to be tendered. That number resulted in eight in the end and of those eight the reduction were in the ATG or Northern Mexico projects. Expectation is that’s on the back of really reform. The reform in Mexico is going to be net net, a very positive event for the service industry. But over the near-term there is a milestones and things that would appear will slowdown the investment or at least sort of the decisions around some more potentially over the near-term. So I think that was one of the drivers in terms of a smaller sort of scope overall. I think the total sort of expectation number there was around $3.5 billion which initially has been expected in the $9 billion to $10 billion kind of range.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Right. So now were the terms on -- how are the terms end up on these contracts compared to what you’re expecting? It sounds like they were worsen you were thinking. Is that fair -- because if I heard you right, it sounds like you’re really -- you are only expecting to win the Mesozoic contract, is that correct?
Dave Lesar: Now that’s correct. Now the terms were – the terms were consistent with what we expected to see. I think we were little surprised by some of the pricing that we saw. I got to think even that there were fewer contracts to go after and there were number of bidders in the bidding for the ATG projects, but pricing on those was significantly down and surprisingly down. And that was just one of those where we’ve -- that was not acceptable pricing for the type of projects that they are.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Got it. Now that Mesozoic is, just correct me if I'm wrong, that's essentially the extension of the Alliance 2 project. So you already have everything mobilized in-country, so it's just a question of that cost absorption. You don't have to ramp up in the country, correct?
Mark McCollum: No, we don't have to ramp up. It's not really an extension of the Alliance 2 project, but we have the people, the kit, all of the resources in-country. We'll need some rigs to work with us. But outside the rigs, we're ready to go.
Dave Lesar: I think David, this is David, think of it as we have the resources and people in-country. It's just that as South Alliance ramps down, those people will not have anything to do, that resource will not have anything to do for a period of time until the next contracts, Humapa and Mesozoic, ramp back up. So rather than do a massive layoff and cost reduction and have to turn around and hire the people straight back, we're just going to absorb the costs in the meantime. So we will not have to add very much incremental costs in terms of where we have been. It's just a way underutilized resource for a couple of quarter period of time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now opened.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Great. Good morning, guys.
Dave Lesar: Good morning, Angie.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Hi. So could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in pressure pumping as far as pricing? Clearly, you had contracts that were being renegotiated in Q4 and we're seeing a little bit of that in Q1. Do you think that pricing could continue to be under pressure into Q2? Have you actually seen an intensification of competition? One of your largest peers mentioned some market share gains, so can you talk about what you're seeing in the market?
Mark McCollum: We're seeing continued pricing pressure certainly in the market. And so as we go into looking at contracts and pricing, one of the first things we look at, are the customers where we can be the most efficient and execute our value proposition. But the market is clearly competitive.
Dave Lesar: I would also add, Angie, with respect to market share gains, it's not coming out of our hide, that's for sure. Yes, there is plenty of stacked equipment out there. There's a bit of flight to quality that goes on in this kind of market and even though pricing is challenged, as Jeff has said, and there is some market share shift going on, it's sure not coming out of ours.
Mark McCollum: I want to reiterate that the 200 basis points of margin improvement in North America for us is net of pricing. So while we assume that pricing will continue to be weak for us, we're working hard to make sure that that does not influence our margins negatively during the year.
Angie Sedita - UBS: All right. Yes, I assumed as much that your market share would not be affected. I guess going to that point, Mark, on the 200 basis point gain in North America. Is that gain in margin weighted to the back half of the year given your mark for Q1? And are you able to quantify yet of that 200 basis points how much is from internal measures, the Battle Red and the Frac of the Future?
Mark McCollum: Well, it's not that I can't yet articulate how we're going to get there, but I don't know that I want to necessarily for public consumption. But it is our view that as we go through the year, the margins will stair-step higher across 2014. It's a cumulative 200 basis points of margin addition. And so we'll realize it as we get into the end of the third quarter which is typically our highest margin quarter. But it should stair-step higher in Q1 and Q2 as well on a year-over-year basis and sequentially.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Okay. And then as a unrelated follow-up on the international markets, clearly 2013 was pretty impressive where you outpaced your peers on the revenue side and operating income. And I thought, Dave, you said you expect to see the same in 2014. Can you talk about where on a relative basis do you expect to outpace your peers? And is this a combination of market share and new technologies or greater market penetration of some markets?
Dave Lesar: I think, Angie, it's really all of the above. I don't want to highlight a certain region or that region all of a sudden gets a big target put on its back. But I would say generally, we're really pleased with where we are in terms of our Eastern Hemisphere market penetration contract win rate, introduction of new technology. So I would just leave it as it's – I'm pretty happy all the way across the board.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James West of Barclays. Your line is now opened.
James West - Barclays Capital: Hi. Good morning, guys.
Dave Lesar: Good morning, James.
James West - Barclays Capital: Dave, a bigger picture question for you on North America. You talked about well efficiencies last year. I think you said 14% and you're expecting high single-digits this year. Where do you think we are in this cycle of well efficiencies and how much more do we have to go where the well count can really outpace the rig count, et cetera? It seems like we're starting to slow down on that.
Dave Lesar: I think clearly the low-hanging fruit has been picked. Right now, I don't see any reason why we will not continue to get year-over-year well count efficiencies. You're starting to see sort of a massive upgrade to the rig fleet that's out there. The move to pad drilling, obviously I think is one of the real drivers we saw last year in terms of the efficiency gains. But as I mentioned in my remarks, the Permian now is switching from what was really a vertical to a horizontal market and there are a lot of rigs running in the Permian right now. And I think that gives us confidence in driving the numbers for 2014 and even beyond that, because let's say the Permian's only at 50% at the end of 2014. That still leaves a pretty tremendous upside there. And there's other plays in the U.S. that are still moving toward more pad, more horizontal drilling. So I think just the nature of the transition of the market, the new technologies that not only Halliburton and the other service companies have, but the rig contractors are investing more in efficiency. So I don't really see an end to it at this point in time, but I think your big low hanging fruit's been picked at this point.
James West - Barclays Capital: Okay, that's fair. And perhaps an unrelated follow-up on Brazil. I understand that you're negotiating with your major customer there about reducing your investment or your cost structure. What's the timing of when you might have some release on the heavier cost structure than you would have expected given the lack of contract size?
Jeff Miller: James, this estimate is very difficult to call at this point in time. We're working on a range of fronts to try to resolve it, talking with the customer and certainly what could be resolution but certainly not in the first half of the year. We don't expect to see that resolve.
Dave Lesar: Yes, I mean the service industry generally doesn't agree on all things all the time but I can tell you, this is one where both us and our peers are all in having the same discussion with Petrobras. We all really need relief at this point.
James West - Barclays Capital: Sure. Okay, got it. Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. I just want to follow-up on James' questions about efficiency. What are you seeing in terms of efficiency on the pressure pumping side? Where are we in that improvement? It's been – the number of stages per day has been growing in a 24-hour time period. How do you see that trending in the coming years and where we are in that progress?
Dave Lesar: Waqar, we don't see that outpacing the improvement in drilling efficiently at least at this point in time. So the upshot is there's still more work to be done though we are improving certainly completion efficiency. The other dynamic in completion efficiency though are what we're doing with the completion. So reality is, we're seeing more stages but we're also seeing bigger stages and we're seeing the ability to do more things around the completion. So the concern around the completion outpacing the drilling is not necessarily a concern for us.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then just one clarification. I just want to clarify, did you say that the margins in North America are likely to be higher or flat in the first quarter versus fourth quarter?
Dave Lesar: We expect to see those modestly higher…
Mark McCollum: Very modest.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now opened.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Thanks. Good morning. With regard to your North America guidance in the first quarter, did I understand the flat prophecy for the quarter? Was that inclusive of an outlook for severe weather in the first quarter or did that exclude the prospect of weather in Q1?
Dave Lesar: Yes, that describe -- we described to you before as high stage count at the beginning of the quarter and then trailed off with the holidays and then a bit of the slow start to some key markets in January due to weather. But what we see is we call out of that is sort of an inverse in Q4. So I call those -- for those reasons about flat.
Mark McCollum: Yes, it is inclusive of weather. It’s just sort of assuming sort of a similar weather pattern to what we had in Q4.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Okay. And then secondly did I hear you correctly Mark with regard to your Latin American margin roadmap for the second half of the year that we hoped to be in the upper teens realm in line with your other international margins by the second half or in the second half?
Mark McCollum: Well, hope it’s a -- yes that’s a strong word.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Okay.
Mark McCollum: I mean that’s where I hope, but I -- right now I just have no ability to forecast thus getting there right now, given what we know on the revenue side. And the cost side, where we’ve talked -- we’ve described that we’re having to carry a significant amount of cost. We don’t have any relief for that cost right now and so we got to get that relief in order to sort of build the roadmap to get back to those upper teen. So yes, that is our hope that certainly what we’re going to continue to drive internally, but at this -- I don’t have it on our forecast right now just because of the uncertainty around cost recovery.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, I’d like to turn the call back to management for any closing comments.
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Sam. On behalf of Halliburton management team, I just want to thank everyone for your participation. And Sam you can go ahead and close the call.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Thanks, Sam. Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton's third quarter 2013 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the third quarter results is also available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO, Jeff Miller, COO, and Mark McCollum, CFO. Tim Probert, President of Strategy and Corporate Development will also be available today for follow-up calls. I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, Form 10-Q for the quarter-ended June 31, 2013, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission laws. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the financial impact of the third quarter charges related to employee severance and asset write-offs, $38 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share unless otherwise noted. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Before I talk about another strong quarterly performance I would like to review the actions we have taken this year around our commitment to delivering shareholder returns to you. This year, we have repurchased approximately 4.4 billion or 10% of our outstanding shares. Earlier this year, we announced a 39% increase in our dividend. These actions reflect our continued confidence and the strength of our business outlook. Going forward, we remain fully committed to increased shareholder returns. We are targeting a dividend payout of at least 15% to 20% of net income, supplemented by additional systematic share buybacks while leaving room for any capital spending or acquisitions we may want to do. We have been and will continue to be relentlessly focused on delivering best-in-class returns. Now, moving to the third quarter. Overall, I am pleased with our operational results. Total company revenue of $7.5 billion was a record quarter for Halliburton, while operating income was over $1.1 billion. We achieved record revenues this quarter in our Boots & Coots, Cementing, Completion Tools, Drill Bits, Multi-Chem and Testing Product lines. From an operating income perspective, our Baroid, Completion Tools, Drill Bits and Testing Product lines also set new records. Turning to the geographies. On a year-to-date basis, our Eastern Hemisphere growth continues to lead our peer group. Compared to last year, third quarter year-over-year revenue and operating income grew 17% and 30%, respectively. Sequentially, the revenue improvement, a 9% growth in operating income was driven by our Europe/Africa/CIS region. In addition to record revenue in that region, we saw a strong sequential improvement in margins of 300 basis points, due to improved performance in our Russia, North Sea and Angola operations. Consistent with previous years, we expect the fourth quarter in the Eastern Hemisphere to be our strongest quarter of the year, due to seasonal year end software and equipment sales. Moving to Latin America. This has been a tough year as customer activity did not meet our expectations and Jeff will talk more about our fourth quarter outlook, but as we look ahead to Latin America over the next few years, there are several positive factors coming into play. First, Mexico activities are expected to pick up significantly as the mega tender projects ramp up in the first part of 2014. Although we do not expect a material impact next year, the recent reform discussions signal a strong opportunity in Mexico shale and deepwater markets. In Brazil, we have a leading market share today in a number of long-term deepwater contracts, including some that could extend past 2020. Although activity levels are just treading water today, as deepwater activity level accelerates, we see significant upside in Brazil. However there could be some short-term bumps in the road, but in the long-term Latin America is expected to be an outstanding growth market for Halliburton. In North America, we are expecting the typical seasonal decline in the fourth quarter that we have experienced in previous years. However there are some additional transitory issues we are currently facing. Due to the recent floods in Colorado, logistical disruptions in the Niobrara, where we have a very high market share are lingering into the fourth quarter which is continuing to impact our efficiency in cost structure in that basin. These cost inefficiencies should be fixed by the end of the year. And pricing, the North America market continues to have excess supply of pressure pumping equipment, and although this is improving, we anticipate pricing pressure will continue as contracts review during the next quarter or so. Accordingly, we are already working on adjusting our cost structure. Despite these transitory issues, we believe that we will see margin improvement as we go through 2014 for a number of reasons. First, the efficiency trend on land plays write to our strengths. We are not only leading the industry and execution and surface efficiency, but we are now introducing new technologies, which are changing the ways that customers approach their subsurface. You will hear more about these at our Analyst Day in a couple of weeks. The Gulf of Mexico activity levels are improving. Currently they are shifting from drilling to completions where we have a leading market position. There are dozen or so deepwater rigs scheduled on the calendar to arise on the Gulf next year and on those we have secured a strong drilling and evaluation position. Thirdly, our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives are being rolled out now. I have seen them start to operate in the field. The benefits are real and we expect that they will be substantial. We have invested a significant amount of money in our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives. As we told you on our last call, when we roll out these two broad corporate initiatives, we are continuously looking for ways to use them to better manage our cost structure in the organization. During the third quarter, based on the progress of these initiatives, we have made adjustments to headcount and assets that resulted in a charge. As we continue with the deployment of our Battle Red initiative over the next few quarters, we expect for there to be additional headcount reductions and related severance charges. However, again, as you will see at our upcoming Analyst Day we are expecting a large future payoff for these initiatives. So overall, I am very optimistic about Halliburton's relative performance as we move into 2014 and based on early conversations with our customers, we are anticipating overall spend levels to increase. Our strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. At our analyst day we intend to provide you more detail about our outlook for the coming years, our ability to outperform our peer group, how we will continue to balance our geographical portfolio and describe our path toward normalized margins for both the Eastern and Western hemisphere operations. We will continue to drive toward expanding our global portfolio in the deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals. Now let me turn the call over to Jeff for some operational details.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Met me begin with an overview of our third quarter results. The Eastern hemisphere had record revenue in the third quarter with sequential operating income growth of 9% driven by record quarterly revenue and improved profitability in the Europe, Africa and CIS region. Relative to the second quarter, Europe/Africa/CIS were both revenue and operating income by 3% and 29% respectively. The sequential improvement was led by improved cementing, Boots & Coots activity in Russia, increased drilling and cementing activity in the North Sea and higher drilling and completion tool sales in Angola. In Norway, Statoil has awarded contracts to Halliburton that provide us with a leading market share in multiple services including drilling and completion fluids, cementing, stimulation, special tools and waste management for both onshore and offshore. The initial scope of this contract is for three years with up to six years in extensions. This award represents a significant statement of confidence from our customers for the value-added technologies that we are bringing to the Norwegian market. In addition we are expanding our testing portfolio in the pre-salt deepwater market in Angola. In addition to discrete testing awards for drill stem testing and our DynaLink service, Halliburton has recently been awarded contracts by multiple customers to provide a full suite of testing in subsea services in their pre-salt operations. Activity on these wins is expect to start throughout 2014 and will give Halliburton a significant position for testing in subsea services in the Angola pre-salt market. In conjunction with our successes in testing offshore discovery wells elsewhere in Africa and in Brazil, these one demonstrate the strength of our deepwater testing and subsea business. In the Middle East/Asia region, compared to the prior quarter, revenue and operating income were lower by 2% and 5% respectively. Higher activity in Saudi Arabia was partially offset by activity delays for stimulation activity in Australia. Also contributing to the sequential decline was the prior quarter benefit from the conclusion of the Majnoon project in Iraq and increased completions activity in Malaysia that did not repeat. Let me speak specifically to the Kurdistan market for a moment. This is an area that until now has been primarily focused on exploration, but we are expecting development work will ramp up over the next few years following a series of successful appraisal programs. However, it is completed construction of large multiproduct line facility in Kurdistan and we are mobilizing for recent awards in cementing, Sperry, Baroid among other product lines. We are still in the early days, but we expect this to be a growth market for Halliburton. In Saudi Arabia, Halliburton was awarded an important three-year contract to drill and complete new wells on an existing field. Saudi Arabia is a core market for Halliburton, and we believe this one demonstrates our customers' confidence in Halliburton's ability to help, plan and mobilized to execute the significant program. Turning to Latin America, we saw a significant improvement compared to the second quarter as revenues increased 6%, sequentially and operating income improved by 57%. Mexico was the primary driver for recent contract approvals resulted in an increase in the consulting and software revenue for the quarter. In the offshore market, stimulation vessel utilization was improved relative to the first half of the year. Additionally, improved profitability in Wireline and cementing in Argentina, contributed to the sequential growth. The improved results in Mexico and Argentina more than offset the activity related weakness in Brazil and Venezuela. With respect to Brazil and Mexico, we believe that the fourth quarter activity levels maybe significantly lower than originally anticipated. There are two primary reasons for this decrease. First, in Mexico, activity levels on our southern alliance the project are expected to decline meaningfully over the remaining months of the year as PEMEX ramps down the ongoing IPM work in preparation for the mega tenders. We averaged seven rigs in the southern alliance project during the third quarter and expect to exit the year at two rigs. This lower level of activity has been expected to continue through early 2014 and company until the new mega tender projects are expected to ramp up. Second, in Brazil, we have seen a significant reduction in drilling activity over the course of the year with a shift in focus to completions. In addition, we are currently operating under a cost structure in line with the original scope of work which has not materialized. We are working with our customer to right size our operational footprint, but we expect reduced activity levels to extend through the fourth quarter and continue into the next year. Ultimately, this does not change our long-term positive outlook for Latin America. The transition to the mega tenders in Mexico, in conjunction with the startup of our incentivized Humapa contract and improved deepwater rig count give us confidence that the activity levels in Mexico will recover as each of these areas gets underway. In Brazil, our recent deepwater contract have a potential term of about eight years, so although drilling activity metrics sideways for several quarters, Brazil remains the largest and most active deepwater market in the world and we believe higher drilling activity levels will resume. As a result, we expect both these countries to continue to be strong contributors to our growth and profitability over time. Now, switching North America, despite the significant revenue and operating income disruption from the Colorado floods, we delivered sequential revenue growth and higher operating income. Activity levels improving and cost the rest of the U.S. land market with seasonal recovery in Canada and increased activity in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater market. U.S. land rig count remained sluggish and the focus from our customers continues to be on pad operations and on drilling efficiency. As we discussed in our previous call, multi-well pads account for over half of our customers drilling activities in key North America basins, including the Marcellus, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Niobrara, and we see this percentage increasing, but more importantly we see increased service efficiency on horizontal drilling which is providing a mid-teens percentage reduction in drilling days on a year-over-year basis. Together, these two efficiency factors are contributing to a well count that has modestly improved even in a flat rig environment. We are also seeing a trend towards increasing stage counts per well, and in certain basins increased volumes pumped per stage. Already, we are seeing average stage count per well increase by 15% to 20% year-over-year in the Eagle Ford and in the Marcellus. We are still in an oversupplied market today, with as much as 20% excess pressure pumping capacity. Nevertheless we believe that an increase in wells drilled per rig combined with greater service intensity driven by increased fluids and profit volumes per well will ultimately help balance the market. We believe that these trends play to Halliburton's strength as the leading service provider in North America. In the Gulf of Mexico, we saw sequential improvement tampered by some activity delays and extended drydock maintenance on one of our large stimulation vessels. In the fourth quarter we expect revenue improvement in the Gulf as that vessel returns to service as well as higher completions activity and end of year sales. Looking ahead we are excited about expanding our share position in this growing market. In addition to our leading completions position, we recently deployed two new vessels focused on the shelf, an intervention vessel and a fit for purpose stimulation vessel. Additionally, we believe we are well-positioned with drilling and evaluation services on the next round of incoming deepwater rigs. To recap North America. Activity levels continue to improve across the U.S. land market this quarter, despite the disruption from the Colorado floods. Increased rig efficiency, combined with greater service intensity, continues to benefit us even with a rig count that is flat. We are increasingly optimistic about 2014 based on early data points and will continue to be very focused on our cost structure to enable margin growth in the coming year. Internationally, we are very pleased with our year-over-year growth. In spite of short-term activity disruptions in Latin America this year, we have led our peer group in year-to-date growth and plan to continue balancing our geographic portfolio and growing our global business going forward. Now Mark will provide some additional financial commentary. Mark?
Mark McCollum: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As Dave discussed, we are continuously evaluating our cost structure within the organization as we deploy our corporate initiatives. The ongoing Frac of the Future build as well as the final deployment of our Battle Red program is having a significant impact on the support and operational headcount needs of North America as well as equipment and inventory requirements. During the third quarter, as we begin to roll out these initiatives, we completed an initial evaluation of these areas and took our first action, which resulted in severance and other charges during the quarter of approximately $38 million after tax. As Dave said, based on the early impact of these strategic initiatives, we believe that further rollout may result in some additional adjustments going forward. Our corporate and other expense came in at a $102 million this quarter, slightly lower than expected due to lower cost for our strategic initiatives and some lower legal expenses. Approximately $27 million of our corporate costs were for continued investment in Battle Red and other strategic initiatives. We anticipate the impact of these investments will be approximately $0.03 per share after tax in the fourth quarter, as we begin the field deployment of the last phases of the North America Battle Red initiative. In total, we anticipate the corporate expenses will be between $110 million and $120 million for the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate this quarter came in at 29.5%, in line with our previous guidance. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate that our tax rate will be approximately 29%. Our capital expenditure guidance of approximately $3 billion for the full year remains unchanged. Also during the quarter, we purchased 68 million shares of common stock at a price of $48.50 per share for an aggregate cost of $3.3 billion excluding fees and expenses related to our tender offer. These shares represented approximately 7.4% of our total number of outstanding shares. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 10% of our outstanding common stock. We have approximately $1.7 billion remaining in Board authorization for future share repurchases. For the fourth quarter, our average share count is expected to be approximately 855 million shares outstanding, which reflects the full benefit of our share buyback to-date. Additionally, due to our recent $3 billion debt offering, we expect interest expense to average approximately $100 million per quarter going forward. Now moving on to our near-term outlook. For our Eastern Hemisphere business, we currently expect fourth quarter year-over-year revenue to increase by low double digits with a meaningful sequential improvement in margins into the high teens. As mentioned earlier, Latin America's sequential growth in margins are expected to be significantly impacted by activity levels in Mexico. For the fourth quarter, we now anticipate Latin America revenue to be flat sequentially and do not expect the material change in margins relative to the third quarter. Finally, for North America, we anticipate the typical weather and holiday-related seasonal declined in revenue and margins in the fourth quarter. With the transitory issues Dave outlined earlier weighing on the number a little more than usual. As a result, we believe North America will be down sequentially although we are not expecting as sharp of a decline as we had in 2012. As we move into 2014, we anticipate North America margins to recover as customer activity resumes and we see the pay off of our strategic efficiency programs in recent cost optimization efforts. Now, I will turn the call back over to Dave for some closing comments. Dave?
Dave Lesar: Thanks, Mark. Just a quick summary, Eastern Hemisphere continues to deliver top-tier growth, leading the industry year-to-date and we expect a strong fourth quarter with margins in the high teens. Latin America will be flattish, but expect strong growth in 2014. For North America, we anticipate typical seasonality in the fourth quarter with some pricing pressure and lingering effects of the Colorado floods, but margin improvement as we go into 2014. Finally, as demonstrated by our dividend increase earlier this year, and the repurchase of 10% of our shares, we are very confident in the strength of our business outlook and are focused on delivering leading shareholders returns. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from James West of Barclays. Your line is now open.
James West - Barclays Capital: Congratulations on a continued strong growth this semester. Very impressive. Dave, a question for you about the outlook for 2014, specifically on the international side. Your peers seem to be coalescing around E&P spending growth somewhere in the kind of 10% range with a higher technology content which of course plays into your strength as well as theirs. Is that similar to your thinking initially?
Dave Lesar: Yes. Absolutely. I think based on discussions with customers, sort of contract flow that we have got in hand I would be surprised if it isn’t around that number for next year.
James West - Barclays Capital: Okay. That's very helpful. Then perhaps a little bit of an unrelated follow-up for me. With the Colorado flooding, I know Mark you had mentioned at a presentation that you thought it was $0.02, $0.03 in the third quarter, but that was an initial assessment. Do you have an updated number or some type of sizing of that impact that we could think about?
Jeff Miller: James, this is Jeff. For competitive reasons, we are not going to give you the number other than to say that it is certainly an important part of our business and I guess I would leave you with, absent that, it would have been enough to move our completion margins up for North America.
Jeff Miller: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jud Bailey of ISI Group. Your line is now open.
Jud Bailey - ISI Group: Thank you. Good morning. Question on your Latin America market. Two biggest markets Mexico and Brazil have some different issues going on. I was wondering if you could help us to think about margins beyond the fourth quarter. What has to happen in Brazil in 2014 and in Mexico, to see a nice recovery in margins? There is the simple increasing activity or there's some other things you guys can do to facilitate better margin growth for Latin America in 2014?
Jeff Miller: Hi Jud, Jeff here. I would say that Brazil it’s the combination of activity increase would help as well as rightsizing our investment, which we are in the process of doing now, so there are some things that we can do and others that we need the client to do. With respect to Mexico, I think we really need to see a settling down of all the moving pieces which, right now, we have got incentivized contract to get started which certainly helps us, as well as the turnover in the contracting around these mega tenders also brings some stability. So I think those two things do as much as any to improve margins into next year.
Jud Bailey - ISI Group: And would it be fair to say that the visibility in both those markets is fairly limited near-term? And if you do get some margin improvement, is it going to more backend loaded for the year? Or is there some reason we could see better improvement earlier in the year.
Jeff Miller: Well, I would say, we typically see quite a bit of seasonality in Latin America and so all the moving parts, I don't think, help in Q1. So I would say we tend to be more backend weighted.
Mark McCollum: Our general profitability in Mexico is very strong. So when this activity does kick up and kick back in we expect a fairly good and solid snapback. As Jeff said that we are getting started in these new contracts in Brazil. We need more activity but even starting those, for there will be a period of time when the Brazil margins may be detrimental to our overall Latin America margins, but remember these are very long-term contracts, eight years and longer and there will be significant up sell opportunities as those contracts gain traction. We have ability to introduce new technologies into that marketplace.
Jud Bailey - ISI Group: Thanks, that's good color. Thank you. My second question just relates to the U.S. land market. I know your customers are still going through the budgeting process, but maybe you could share with us anything you are hearing from your customers, in terms of giving us little more color on your thoughts for 2014 in terms of activity levels and what your customers are telling you for next year?
Jeff Miller: Yes. For 2014, the outlook is fairly strong. The discussions we are having now sees confidence in the oil window and continuing to invest. So we certainly have a positive outlook for 2014.
Mark McCollum: It may not necessarily reflect itself in rig count, but certainly in the well count and efficiencies everybody is very, very focused on continuing to drive efficiencies in the marketplace.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Thanks and good morning. Back to North America and the Q4 seasonality. Dave, I think you prophesied a typical seasonality into Q4 and yet what unfolded in the third quarter was largely atypical with regard to the flooding in Colorado. So wouldn't that mute the seasonality in the fourth quarter relative to the third?
Dave Lesar: Well I guess, if we were up and blowing and going in the Niobrara, it might. But as I said, that's sort of lingering into Q4. And I think it's fair to say the visibility on Q4, right now, is not as great as we would like it to be because based on conversations we are having with customers, the holiday work schedule is one of the big unknowns at this point in time with Christmas falling in the middle of the week, and just where various customers are in terms of spending their budgets for the year and those sorts of things. I think we are just, as we sit here today, what we see is a typical Q4 unfolding in front of us and if it changes from that, obviously we will have either a positive or a negative impact from there.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Got it. And with regards to capital allocation, I know you guys are not done with your planning process, but could you just give us some broad parameters with regard to capital spending for '14? And then moreover the mechanics of the dividend implementation, 15% to 20% of net income, when does that get announced and what is that predicated on? Is that an internal view as to what you guys will be generating in terms of net income or what?
Dave Lesar: Okay. So on the capital side, it is still early in the planning process but I think that, right now, as we look ahead while there are - we are pretty excited about the growth trajectory going into 2014 we are driving hard on efficiencies. So that will probably continue to allow us to be more disciplined around how much capital we are putting into the marketplace. So we don't sit here today expecting a significant increase in capital overall. There will be some specific projects, maybe some reorientation within the budget. We will continue to rollout our Q-10s and the Frac of the Future into the North American marketplace and question is how rapidly do we do that vis-à-vis the overall market trajectory, but right now don't see significant changes in the capital overall. The dividend policy, the 15% to 20% of net income, it will always be sort of a moving target. The Board has the discretion to set that dividend target, they do so always in looking not just at the net income, but also our cash flow and looking at our relative investment opportunities that fall ahead of us. I guess the answer is stay tuned and we will be talking with the Board and then making adjustments as necessary, but our cash flow continue to be very, very positive. Even with all the actions that we took this quarter, we are very pleased with the cash flow in the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. My question relates to international service pricing. What are you seeing there? Either the same trends, are you seeing some better pricing now?
Jeff Miller: This is Jeff. As we look out into the Eastern Hemisphere, we have continued to see steady improvement, but no inflection point if that's where that question is leading, so there is a lot of visibility on the growth in the Eastern Hemisphere or internationally and to a large degree we are built into that.
Dave Lesar: Waqar, this is Dave. I would also add to that any tendering on large project still is tending to be very, very competitive.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: What will it take to change that kind of competitive pressure? What do you think the industry needs to see?
Jeff Miller: It would be a dislocation sort of event where there is inadequate capacity to meet demand, but I would say that as Dave said, the majority of the contracts are fairly large and there is a lot of visibility of those contracts, so I don't see kind of any surprises in the Eastern Hemisphere that would create that sort of supply/demand dislocation.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: Then vis-à-vis Brazil, you mentioned about rightsizing and you also mentioned if you need to get customer approval for that, but when do you think you will know one way or other whether you can right size there or not. What's the kind of timeline there?
Jeff Miller: Yes. We expect to see some of those answers into Q1. I would expect.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Hi, so we talked a little about on your last conference call. Can you give us your updated thoughts us on the U.S. pressure pumping markets and maybe we could reach equilibrium in conjunction with that on the Frac of the Future initiative given this competitive environment and the value to rolling out the Frac of the Future program at accelerated pace. As you are rolling out to this program, are you retiring or relocating equipments?
Dave Lesar: Yes. With respect to the Frac of the Future, we are continuing to roll that out and as we rolled it out, we have retired equipment or moved that equipment overseas, so yes we see value in continuing that program and getting the equipment into the market. With respect to attrition sort on the back of current utilization in the North America, as we said there is about a 20%, we believe oversupply in the market now though we do see increasing drilling efficiency sort of the rate that is greater than increasing completion efficiency and because of that, we expect to see attrition continue. You know at what point that is? I expect, certainly out into next year, late next year or beyond though any spiking gas activity will certainly take that out very quickly.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Okay, so you are thinking at this time late this year or late 2014 or potentially even fairly 2015?
Dave Lesar: That's right.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Okay, and then as an unrelated follow up. Can you give us an update on your efforts to enter the artificial lift segment? I know you purchased a small artificial lift company some time ago. Are there other acquisition opportunities out there or do you think you can grow this business internally? And if you do grow it internally, how long do you think it will take to have critical mass in the segment?
Dave Lesar: Angie, this is Dave. Let me handle that one. We have talked over the couple of calls about the entry into artificial lift, especially ESPs. And I can tell you, it's a fantastic business. So it's one of our fastest growing businesses, although it's not big enough to move the needle for us right now but because we like it so much, we are going to look at both driving organic growth as well as bolt-on acquisitions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Thanks, good morning. On the Europe/Africa/CIS side, I notice that the C&P margins spiked this quarter. I was just wondering, is this from point forward product sales into the third quarter and therefore should we expect those margins to kind of head back into the mid-teens in the fourth quarter?
Mark McCollum: No. This is just on the back of the strengthening business, both completions and stimulation.
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Okay, that's great. Okay, and I had one other question that is completely unrelated here, just on your Battle Red and Frac of the Future. I just wondered if you just help us conceptualize how the impact is going to play out here. Can you kind of tell us, if you look and say one of your frac fleet, say two years ago versus one of the new fleets today, where is the biggest difference here in terms of the cost and efficiency? You have talked about reducing labor. I am just wondering, is it the size of the frac spread, is it the reduced maintenance spending? Now you have been into this for a couple of years. Where do you see the biggest impact here?
Dave Lesar: Stay tuned for our Analyst Day, Dave. That's where we are going to lay it all out here in a couple of weeks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Good morning, guys.
Dave Lesar: Hey, Jim.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Your CapEx is significantly above your DD&A and has been for a while and it's significantly higher, on a ratio basis above your peers. Now you are generating fabulous returns on capital. So I am not claiming but can you explain to us why your CapEx versus your DD&A is so much higher than your peers.
Mark McCollum: I don't have enough insight into our peers to understand what they are doing on their capital spending. I know what drives ours. For a long time, we are spending a lot of maintenance cost on old fully depreciated equipment. So when we evaluate what we are doing, we are looking at maintenance cost and depreciation on a combined whole. So, yes, our depreciation is going up as we have new equipment we have relatively fast depreciation rates relative to useful lives of that equipment in terms of what we can do with it long-term and is driving our maintenance cost down on a percentage of revenue basis overall. So it's a zero some gain. The other thing that we, of course, had to do over the last several years has made some fairly substantial investments in manufacturing, technology centers and fixed assets, basis of things around the world to position ourselves for the growth in Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America that we are achieving. So it may not look as productive but the fact is that's handy for being able to be there and to serve those customers in the places around the world. So that's been a fairly large percentage of our overall CapEx and that will probably continue as we continue to expand and in particularly in the unconventional market around the world over the next several years.
Dave Lesar: Yes, Jim, this is Dave. Let me just give you a little perspective on what's Mark saying. If you add up the amount that we have spent on manufacturing our big new facility in Singapore, our big new technology centers in Huston and in Saudi and Brazil, they are probably pushing a $1 billion just for those. Plus you add up the infrastructure we have built out in the U.S. to help our logistics and those are current cash flow, long-term depreciation, but I am telling you long-term payback things for Halliburton. So I think that we have had a spike in the fixed assets side of the business but they will pay off in the long run.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Okay. So I guess the returns you are generating, I am not complaining, but I was curious. My follow-up if I could, Battle Red. When we hear you have record revenues, but that you are laying people off, people get spooked. They think that's foreshadowing. Where's the Battle Red initiative? Where the layoffs being done as this all the U.S. initiative so far? I realize there initiatives, but can you kind of tell us where the targeted goal is in terms of people to where it's occurring, so we can have greater confidence that this isn't foreshadowing for some slowdown?
Dave Lesar: Yes. Jim, the bulk of that was in North America. It was geared around our efficiency drive and it was taking out basically as we have to do things more efficiently, we find that there are people that are excess, we are able to effectively do more efficient work in the back office. Also even at the co-pay, so our ability to relook at how efficiently we do work, so I would say that's not foreshadowing. What that is, is really coming to fruition sort of our confidence and the ability to execute the work either with fewer people or fewer people in the back-office.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: Thanks. Good morning guys. Maybe I will stick with the Western Hemisphere as well, please, and start with a question that may feel little bit more open ended than I like, but let's see how you guys respond to it. I guess I am curious as '14 is shaping up for you. Whether you see the relative opportunity it's looking at things like reduce cluster spacing, higher sand per stage, some of things you have mentioned. I guess I am curious whether the opportunity seems more bent or more shaped by more customers of yours adopting those kinds of measures more aggressively or in other words sort of raising the averages, if you will, across the landscape or if it is a little bit more sort of rig count and well count-driven.
Dave Lesar: That is more customer-driven than that is rig count-driven. I think this is though just a view of how to get better frac propagation, what could be the technologies and so I would say it is a technical view more so than it is sort of the overall averages just moving up.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: Okay, but more of your customers are applying some of those enhanced recovery, if you will, or enhanced techniques.
Dave Lesar: Brad, we have talked about in the past. It's really service intensity and it's sort of service intensity beyond just getting more fracs or more wells down per pad. It's actually now applying some of the new technologies that we have to make better wells, lower cost of BOE and make our customers more money, but also generate additional revenues for us. Then if the rig count kicks up on top of that, that would just the additional plus to the upside.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: Great. Okay that's some fruitful thought. An unrelated follow-up. I just would appreciate some more clarity also on Mexico. If your current activity is declining at least onshore, first of all, is the jack-up market at all an offset here even as you hit early in '14? Then secondly, can you maybe just give us an update on the mega tenders and if there has been any kind of delay in terms of your expectations and in terms of getting those awarded and again trying to place when some of that work might kick in for everybody?
Dave Lesar: Yes. I mean there are offset. That's a big market in Mexico, so there are offsets and there is offshore work that's being done, there is deepwater work that's being done. For example, the incentivized contract, so there are offsets in that market. With that said, the mega tenders are important, because it sort of refreshes budgets and resets the table in terms of work well in to the future. As far as the timing of that goes, no, I am not surprised by where that stands. I mean, knew that that would be a large undertaking and take time for our client to get organized around how to put that out. Again, our view is sort of early Q2 is a realistic sort of startup time for that activity if things proceed as planned.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from of Doug Becker of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Jeff, you mentioned the completion efficiencies are increasing in a slower rate than the drilling efficiencies. Just hoping to get some order of magnitude here and what technologies should we be keeping an eye on that could flip this? In other words what technologies might make completion efficiencies outpace drilling efficiencies going forward in just perpetuating the oversupply in frac?
Jeff Miller: Yes, as we look at that, if we think that the drilling efficiencies up in that 20% range and we look at completion efficiency somewhat less than that, we will see it probably about in that 7%, 8% sort of efficiency in drilling that's outpacing the efficiency in completions. I think one of the things that tempers completion efficiency is going to be the size of jobs and the amount of activity requires completion actually get in some cases bigger rather than smaller and this where the frac purification [ph] happens. So again, my outlook is that we continue to add equipment over time as opposed to the other.
Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, and then Mark, you mentioned that North American margins would be down in the fourth quarter but not as bad as last year. Does this mean, for margins, we should be assuming a normal seasonal decline 50, 100 basis points, just on our numbers?
Mark McCollum: Yes, that's exactly what you should expect.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Hi, good morning.
Dave Lesar: Good morning. Hi, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: I am just curious. You guys have addressed the excess capacity situation. We continue to do this, it seems, on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Just wanted to get an update from you, as to your latest thought as to when you think the supply demand curves may balance? Any guesses on that in 2014?
Jeff Miller: Yes, this is Jeff. I would say, it is like 2014 or early '15 by the time when we start to see that tightening though as I just described, I do think that we are down the path that it consumes more equipment rather than adding more equipment.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, and then you guys referenced some of your contract renewal and repricing and so on. In general what kind of magnitude of pricing pressures are you seeing at this point vis-à-vis your prior contracts?
Mark McCollum: For competitive reasons, that's something we just can't give.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Okay.
Mark McCollum: Sorry.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: No, fair enough. Alright, That's it for me. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question come from Jim Crandell of Cowen. Your line is now open.
Jim Crandell - Cowen: Good morning. You said in, I think, your press release that you had lower profits from Iraq and then you stated on your call about the new contract ending. I thought you had written that down to breakeven anyway? Could you reconcile that for me?
Mark McCollum: Now, Jim, what happened in the second quarter, as we really made a hard push to get that contract done at the end of the second quarter. It's built over a little bit but the reality of that push, it increased our profitability on that contract as we took it across the finish line. Now it's over and while there is a little bit of work left, a very small phase two, we finished that first phase of those big contracts, the initial awarded contracts. So it hasn't impacted in reducing the overall profitability in Iraq overall. But that isn't to say that we are losing money there. Just the opposite. In fact, as we go forward on our new contracts, we are trying to be very, very disciplined about the work that we take on and making sure that it continues to improve our profitability in that region going forward. It is magnitude as always and not the margins.
Jim Crandell - Cowen: Mark, how do you see the overall levels of activity trending for Halliburton in Iraq going forward?
Dave Lesar: Go ahead, Jeff.
Jeff Miller: Yes. I have got a positive outlook on our activity as we go into 2014. So what I would say is, we are much more disciplined around the contracts that we pursue and the terms under which we will accept them, so it's returns and margins first as opposed to top line growth and we have been, as I said very disciplined about that, so I am confident that we will grow that business, but again grow business that we can all be happy with.
Jim Crandell - Cowen: Okay. Just one quick follow-up. Did you say that the price deterioration that you are seeing in the U.S. and that you expect in the U.S. is frac-only and are there any other product lines in the quarter which experienced price deterioration in the U.S.?
Jeff Miller: Jim, this is Jeff. No. I would say that the pricing pressure we see is more widespread than just fracturing.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is now open.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Hi. Good morning. With Q4 a heavier time of the year for contract rollovers in the frac market and spot crews for the industry generally is just not making any money. I think it's obviously contracts will be a bit more competitive. Can you just talk about how your strategy as you go into these rollovers, how you think to differentiate yourselves?
Dave Lesar: From a differentiation standpoint, Jeff, we absolutely believe that in our ability to deliver efficiency with that technology I won't through them with PermStim, but a whole range of chemistry technologies and others that absolutely differentiate Halliburton in the market, so we look at contracts in any sort of environment those are the things that we turn to and that our clients count on Halliburton to do.
Jeff Miller: The competition that varies basin-to-basin and so depending on the amount of capacity that's there, the complexity of the reservoir, we can make a different value proposition with customers on differentiation. In some cases, where they have gone off and the customer has experienced what someone else has done we have been able to take that fork back at a little bit higher price.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt: Then around (inaudible). It's been focused my understanding, mostly North America with the successes you are having there. Any reason to think you won't continue this push globally?
Dave Lesar: No.
Jeff Miller: No. We expect that as we go into '14 and beyond, we will be staging the rollout once we kind of get all the kings out in the North America, the rest of the world is ready to go and so we will be rolling those out over time although probably at a slightly slower space than we used for the North America rollout just given its size and complexity.
Kelly Youngblood: Sam, we believe we have time for one more caller.
Operator: Yes, sir. Our final question comes from Scott Gruber of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein: Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. Back on the domestic frac market, pricing continues to decline, but it appears that the operating margins for the industry is actually up. Is it fair to say that the primary driver of the pricing weakness today is a willingness by the pumpers to actually lower rates to improve asset turns via these 24-hour services? My question is actually would we still be seeing pricing declines if there wasn't a trend toward more 24-hour work?
Dave Lesar: The question was would we see a decline without the 24-hour work. It's an interesting question. Scott, I don't know for sure whether we would know that or not, because obviously you can't ever exactly know what motivates our competitors to sort of come in with the pricing that they do, but I do think that often times what we are seeing is guys really wanting to get equipment to work and willing to take a lower price if that's necessary to do that. The question always is, okay, but are they really creating the value for the customer. In our sort of overall value proposition, we are always focused on. It's not just the cost per stage to the customer, but what are they achieving on an increased production, driving down the overall cost on a per BOE basis, and when customers get focused on that, I think that the results begin to change in our favor.
Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein: Well, are you still seeing declines in pricing for single spot wells? Can you identify contracts, new incremental 24-hour work with the pricing pressure is a lot more severe as pumpers compete for that work? Is the asset turn improvements huge.
Dave Lesar: Well I guess what I will say is we don't typically, I mean we don't pursue that one off market that you just described. And so I would, just from competitive standpoint, I wouldn't walk through our contracts and our pricing on those different contracts. So suffice to say, that we tend to work in a more contracted fashion but we are on a longer period of time.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time I will turn the call back to management for any closing comments.
Dave Lesar: Yes, before closing the call, I just want to remind everybody that on November 6, we will be having our Analyst Day and it will be webcast. You will be able to access the webcast link from the Investor Relations page on halliburton.com. And with that Sam, I will turn it back over to you to close up call.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I’d now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2013 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the first quarter results is also available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Jeff Miller, COO; and Mark McCollum, CFO. Tim Probert, president of strategy and corporate development will also be available today for follow-up calls. I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 and recent current reports on Form 8-K. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Overall I am pleased with our second quarter results. Total company revenue of $7.3 billion was a record quarter for Halliburton and operating income was over $1 billion. We achieved record revenues this quarter in our Baroid, Cementing, Completion Tools, Multi-Chem, and Testing product lines. From an operating income perspective, Baroid, Testing and Artificial also set new records. Turning to the geographies, our international operations grew 8% sequentially which is at the top of our peer group. This growth came from record revenues in both of our eastern hemisphere regions. Compared to our two primary competitors, we have delivered leading year over year international revenue growth over the last five quarters. Also notable for the quarter, our international revenue comprised almost half of our total company revenue, which clearly demonstrates the success on our ongoing strategy to grow our international business and balance our geographic mix. So clearly, we are not just North America pressure pumping company. Our Eastern Hemisphere played out as we expected. Revenue was up 11% sequentially and operating income was up 23%. I want to specifically highlight our Middle East/Asia region, which had an outstanding revenue growth of 20% and operating income growth of 43% relative to the second quarter of last year. This is a very exciting market for Halliburton today and we expect our Middle Asia region to be the highest growth want that we have led by Saudi Arabia, Iraq and all of Asia. For the year, we still fully expect Eastern Hemisphere margins to average in the upper teens, with year-over-year revenue growth in the mid-teens. With pricing improvement opportunities in the Eastern Hemisphere continuing to be somewhat illusive, our current operating bias is toward improving our utilization and efficiency as we address the increase spend from our customers. Jeff will discuss the weaker than expected Latin America performance and the Mexico integrated project market in greater detail. But I want to be clear on one thing, we feel confident that revenue and margins of Latin America will improve in the second half of the year. We expect margins to improve in the third quarter and approach the mid-teens level and expect full year margins to be approximately the same. In summary, our international outlook has not changed. We expect consistently solid year-over-year growth in several key markets. Although, there is still uncertainty around Egypt, Libya and North Mexico activity in the near-term, our deepwater share gains coupled with increase rig count in Saudi Arabia and an anticipated rebound in Latin America during the second half provide us confidence that we will continue to outperform on the relative basis to our peers. North America also delivered results as we expected and I’m pleased with the quarter. Revenue was up 3% despite a sluggish U.S. land rig count and 71% lower Canadian rig count. We also saw 120 basis points sequential improvement in our margins to 17.5%. We are now expecting the rig count to remain relatively flat for the remainder of the year as we absorb a meaningful switch to multi-well pad activity among our customer base. We believe this incremental drilling efficiency gains will provide for higher service intensity. We currently estimate that pad drilling represents as much as 50% of the activity across key U.S. basins and we’ll continue to pick higher. As an example, we’ve seen the Eagle Ford growth of less than 40% pad activity last year to over 60% today. Ultimately, we believe this efficiency trend bodes very well for us in the long run as our scale and expertise allows us to lead the industry in executing factory-type operations. And despite issues around capacity, utilization and pricing for the balance of the year, we do expect North American margins to continue to improve. We believe we have reasonable visibility around North America activities for the third quarter. At this time it’s too early to tell the full extent of customer plan revisions and their impact on activity in the fourth quarter. However, we believe that current commodity prices make budget reloading of more compelling option for our customers, which could help mitigate the risk to our fourth quarter slowdown. I’m optimistic about Halliburton’s relative performance for the remainder of the year and our ability to grow our North America margins and continue to realize revenue and margin expansion in our international business. Our strategy is intact and working well, and we intend to stay the course. We will continue to drive toward expanding our global portfolio in deepwater, mature fields and unconventionals. We have been and will continue to be focused on delivering best-in-class returns. We bought back billion dollars of shares in the second quarter and today announced an additional repurchase of our authorization to total of $5 billion. These actions reflect our growing confidence in the strength of our business outlook and our ability to not only increase our buybacks but our dividends while leaving room for any capital spending or additional acquisitions we may want to do. Now let met turn the call over to Jeff and he’ll provide some additional operating detail.
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Let me begin with an overview of our second quarter results. The Eastern Hemisphere had solid sequential improvement compared to the first quarter of 2013 with revenue growth of 11% and operating income growth of 23%. The improvement was led by seasonal recoveries in Norway and Russia along with the improved activity levels in Angola and across all of Asia. In the Middle East Asia region, compared to the first quarter, revenue and operating income increased 12% and 17% respectively. The growth was driven by higher stimulation, wireline and fluids activity in Malaysia, increased drilling and stimulation activity in China and improved profitability in Iraq. The Middle East Asia is a high growth region for us and Malaysia is a great example where revenue grew 40% year-over-year and profit more than doubled driven by our strategic offshore wins. We continued to build on this success in the second quarter displacing a major competitor to provide offshore cementing services and in addition winning a series of fluids contracts in Malaysia with an aggregate estimated value in excess of $500 million over the next four years. Additionally, continuing our growth in Saudi Arabia, in the second quarter, we were rewarded a three year lump sum turnkey project to provide reentry services in an existing field. This strategic win comes in addition to the recently expanded reward for our multi-rig turnkey project in the kingdom. Turning to Europe, Africa and CIS, relative to the first quarter, revenue and operating income increased 9% and 33% respectively. The improvement was driven by higher fluids and cementing activity in Russia, increased stimulation, fluids and completion tools activity in Norway and higher drilling and completions activity in Angola. A highlight of note in the region, during the second quarter, our Baroid product line partnered with Cobalt International Energy to transfer our supersaturated (inaudible) viscosity fluid technology from the Gulf of Mexico to Deep Water Angola. This as well as the D&E were (inaudible) deepwater drilling and we believe this technology will be instrumental to the future success of Angola’s new subsalt drilling project. Within Europe, Africa and CIS region, we also have been successful in executing several strategically integrated projects. Let me give you a few examples now. In Russia we saw early success with our Em-Yoga integrated tight oil project. The project began earlier this year and by applying unconventional, multistage completion techniques to [this mature field], production has already materially exceeded targets leading to substantially increased activities in those fields. In Norway, we recently completed first phase of an integrated multi-well project. Based on our success in delivering services and accelerating the production cycle, our contract has been renewed to 2015 and was expanded to include two additional fields. And finally, in the Danish sector of the North Sea, we were recently awarded a five year multi product line contract with an estimated value of over $100 million to provide services on a high pressure, high temperature development. This reward was based on our proven track record of delivering integrated services in the Scandinavian market and a recognized expertise with HPHT services. All three of these projects are good examples of how we collaborate internally and with our customers to drive value into a project both with the operator and for Halliburton. Overall, our Eastern Hemisphere performance has been impressive. If we look back to this year last -- this time last year; we’ve grown revenue by 16% and operating income by 22%. In Latin America, we had a disappointing start to the year. Revenues were flat compared to the first quarter and operating income was down 7% as a result of reduced drilling activity in North Mexico, increased mobilization costs in both Brazil and Mexico and lower vessel activity offshore Mexico. Moving into the second half of the year, we’re confident that we will see an uptick in Latin American financial results. Let me touch on the few of the key drivers now. In Columbia, we see second half levels improving as our customers resolve some of the recent permitting delays. In Brazil, during the third quarter, we will complete mobilization of our directional drilling contract and expect the transition to our new market share in the fourth quarter. And finally, in Mexico, we expect to see the largest improvement. In the third quarter, we’re confident we will secure contract approvals related to our consulting and software services and see increased utilization of our stimulation vessels. We also expect to have finished mobilization of equipment for our recent offshore intervention services contract. We anticipate the North Mexico activity will continue to be an issue for the region in 2013. However, I'm pleased to announce that we were recently awarded the Humapa block by Pemex in the [lease round] and incentivized projects. Scheduled to begin in early 2014, this estimated $1.2 million project is for multiyear asset management contract in Chicontepec Basin. This most recent round of incentivized contract differs from the previous round and then it provides 100% cost recovery for our services during the first phase of the project. We expect returns for this project to be generated from our own service revenues and to be accretive to our overall business. We were very selective in targeting the Humapa block. In fact, it was the only one we’re dealing with. Because we believe that this project would generate robust returns at a lowest level of risk and better experience in the nearby Remolino Laboratory gives us a technical advantage in delivering timely productive wells. We’re also currently evaluating a pipeline of large integrated projects in Mexico valued at an estimated $8 billion. We expect this work will be awarded towards the end of the year. With the combination of these integrated projects and the Humapa project, we’re excited about 2014 and beyond for Mexico. Let me give you a few other Latin American highlights for the quarter. In Brazil, we inaugurated our Technology Center in Rio de Janeiro for Halliburton personnel to collaborate with operators and the country's leading university and a global center of expertise for both deepwater and mature fields. Further, in the ultra-deepwater pre-salt market at Brazil, Halliburton successfully performed the deepest wireline fluid sampling and Rotary Sidewall Coring job ever undertaken. Samples were retrieved from depths of over 22,000 feet helping our customer identify the most productive zones of this exploration well. We also see opportunity in the offshore Mexico market. We recently displaced the major competitor to provide open-hole logging services on a deepwater well. Based on a reservoir characterization portfolio including our geo mineralogical tool and our RDT formation tester with fluid indemnification. Now, moving to North America, revenue was sequentially up 3% and operating income was up 10% driven by increased U.S land activity partially offset by reduced seasonal activity in Canada. Consistent with the first quarter, approximately 85% of our crews on the long-term contracts and about three quarters of working 24 hour operations. In spite of relatively flat sequentially U.S. rig count, drilling efficiencies in the trend towards multiwell pads are driving more robust well count. Additionally, in some cases, we’re seeing operators increasing the number of stages on horizontal wells performing as many as 40 stages per lateral in the Marcellus in certain [zones]. It’s our view that the result in increased well count and stage count could absorb the remaining 4 percentage of the excess horsepower and help drive service intensity across all product line. Although we believe excess pressure pumping capacity has diminished since the first quarter due to rising demand, there is still an over supply in the market. As a result, we anticipate the pricing pressure will persist to some degree across many North American basins in 2013. Additionally, as we gauge the utilization of our equipment on a 24x7 basis, we see a significant opportunity to improve and drive the light space, by that I mean the downtime out of the schedule. In this environment, we believe it’s more important than ever to be aligned with most efficient customers where we can create the most value for our customers and deliver the best returns for Halliburton. We’re continuing to execute our strategy around surface efficiencies, subsurface technology and testing chemistry, delivering differentiated services that generate superior returns over the long term. As part of this larger strategy, Frac of the Future and Battle Red are really the platforms that enable surface sufficiency. We expect to see increased performance at the well head, as we incorporate these tools into our processes. Battle Red effectively applies new processes and technologies to standardize and automate integrated workflows across our product line driving improved efficiency across our North American Service Delivery Organization. Although there are some associated cost savings, this initiative is primarily directed in improving working capital and cash flow. We’re targeting a 50% reduction in days to bill our customers and we expect these tools to also be able to help manage inventory level, reduce overtime and optimize low freight deliveries. As an example, we’ve already seen a 15% to 20% reduction in costs around trade and standby charges. We anticipate Battle Red roll out will be completed in the first quarter of 2014. Next is our Frac of the Future program, which is designed to reduce capital and operational costs at the well side. All these data indicates Q10 are running two to three times longer than existing power burden cost and five to six times longer than the industry standard before requiring maintenance, which we anticipate will reduce our fleet maintenance experience 5% to 30% . This efficiency also allows us to reduce the equipments needed on location by an average of 25% decreasing the capital required to deliver Frac fleet and reducing labor and fuel costs. Specific labor to process automation and reduce vehicle counts on the job site. Over the last few years, we’ve indeed reduced our crew charges by close to 30% and believe our crews on location are currently streamlined. When we look at what we’re able to deliver on a stage per head count basis, we’ve seen a 40% rise in executional efficiency over the same time period. By the end of this year, we anticipate that close to 20% of our fleet will be converted to Frac of the Future. The rate at which we deploy going forward will be dependent on three factors; North American natural gas activity, the growth of international oil conventional and our requirements would replace older equipment. We believe our manufacturing capability has a strategic advantage allowing us to manage deployment and quickly take advantage of changing market conditions. Assuming a consistent build schedule of new equipment, we expect to reach the 50% mark on Frac of the Future deployment around 2015. We believe these strategic initiatives will deliver material differentiation and provide a sustainable competitive advantage to Halliburton for the years to come. Turning to the Gulf of Mexico, revenue was impacted by BOP certification related issues that has delayed several of our large completions to the back part of the year. For the remainder of the year, we expect revenue and profit will average higher than the first half, as deepwater arrive and more rigs move to development and completions. We’re optimistic about the Gulf of Mexico deepwater market and are excited about our competitive position in the lower treasury market that we expect maybe double in 2014. We continuously work for ways to better manage our cost structure in the organization. As we migrate towards more efficient, differentiated service platforms, such as Battle Red and Frac of the Future, it will have an impact on support and operational headcount as well as equipment and inventory requirements. We expect to complete an evaluation of these areas and you take action on them in the third quarter, which will result in severance and other charges during the quarter. We’ll be identifying these separately in our third quarter results. So to summarize North America, we’re forecasting rig count to remain stable for the year, but believe that activity levels can improve as a result of drilling efficiencies and further adopting of flat well drilling. In a flat pricing and rig count environment, cost management is going to be more can and be extremely important, so we anticipate better cost optimization will result from our strategic initiatives. We’re maintaining close contact with our customers to better understand their budget plans for the reminder of the year. We want to be clear that we expect North American margins to increase the balance of the year. And finally, we’re committed to growing our international revenues and margins and achieving a better geographic balance in our business going forward. I think our performance this quarter speaks for the progress we’re making on that front. And now, Mark will provide some additional financial commentary. Mark?
Mark McCollum: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. Our corporate and other expense came in at $108 this quarter, slightly lower than expected due to some insurance reimbursements for legal costs, associated with Macondo litigation as well as decrease in costs related to our corporate initiatives. Approximately $34 million of our corporate costs were for continued investments in Battle Red and other strategic initiatives. The cost of these initiatives will be declining over the next few quarters. We anticipate the impact of these investments will be approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per share after tax in the third quarter. In total, we anticipate that corporate expenses will average between a $110 million and $120 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. We continue to benefit from the strategic realignment of our international operations completed last year and the continued expansion of our international business. Our effective tax rate this quarter came in at 29% in line with the low end of previous expectations. We anticipate though that we might see a slight increase to about 29.5% for the third quarter. Our capital expenditure guidance of approximately $3 billion for the full year remains unchanged. Throughout this quarter, we have continued to pursue in our (inaudible) settlement to resolve a substantial portion of the private claims pending in the Macondo multi-district litigation. However, discussions among the parties to the proposed settlement have recently slowed while BP challenges certain provisions of their previous settlement with the plaintiffs' Steering Committee including a current appeal in the Fifth Circuit Court. We continue to believe that a reasonably valued settlement is in the best interest of our shareholders. But given the complexity of the current situation among other parties, it is difficult to estimate when or if a resolution through settlement can be reached. In the meantime, we’ll continue to argue our defense against any liability in the course. No adjustments to the Macondo Reserve was recorded during the second quarter as the MDL trial and other investigations progressed, we’re constantly monitoring and evaluating developments. And it’s possible that we may need to adjust our reserve estimate up or down in the future. At this time, our reserve estimate does not include potential recoveries from our insurers. However, we did a reach favorable agreement with a portion of our insurers during the quarter which among other things, allows us to continue to be reimbursed for our legal cost. As we communicated in our first quarter call, we intended to be more aggressive in our second quarter common stock repurchase activity. During the second quarter, we upsized our revolving credit facility from $2 billion to $3 billion and used the excess liquidity that transaction created to repurchase $23 million shares of common stock. Last week, our Board of Directors approved increase in the authorization for future share repurchases to $5 billion. We are currently evaluating the best available repurchase methods. This increased authorization together with the 39% increase in dividends announced in the first quarter is a reflection of our growing confidence in the Street from our business outlook and our continuing commitment to shareholder distributions. Going forward, we believe that company will generate sufficient cash flows to enable us to grow our business, increase shareholder returns and maintain flexibility to take advantage of any strategic opportunities we see. Now, moving on to our near-term outlook. For our international business, we expect stronger revenues and margins during the second half of the year, but weighted more heavily to the fourth quarter. For the eastern hemisphere, we’re currently expecting third quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the second quarter with a modest sequential improvement in margins. Latin American growth is expected to be muted by the activity curtailment in Mexico but we should see a moderate sequential improvement of revenue with margins approaching the mid teens. And for North America, we anticipate a flat U.S. rig count for the third quarter. However, we expect to see the seasonal rebound from breakup in Canada along with stronger activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico. And we anticipate the net result will be modestly higher sequential revenues and margins. Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing comments. Dave?
Dave Lesar: Okay. I know a lot of people were dialing in late, so let me give you a quick summary of what we said today. The North America based on improving activity levels in Canada and the Gulf and continued efficiency gains for U.S. land, we expect margins to continue to improve for the balance of the year. As Mark said, in Latin America, we feel confident that revenue and margins can improve in the second half with margins approaching the mid-teens in the third quarter. For the Eastern Hemisphere, our outlook remains unchanged. For the full year we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens with margins in the upper teens. And our aggressive buybacks in the second quarter and the increase to our repurchase authorization clearly demonstrate our growing confidence we have in the strength of our entire business outlook. And finally, we have been and will continue to be relentlessly focused on delivering best-in-class returns. So with that let’s open it up for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Thank you. Good morning. Dave, I’m curious and this sort of weaves into Jeff’s narrative with regard to the Frac of the Future and of that Battle Red but the C&P margins in this quarter was actually a pleasant surprise for me. And I’m just curious in a relatively labored D&E capital spending environment, sure with well counts and stage counts increasing, but overall absolutely, relatively flat range of our commodity prices as it were and free cash flow generation is still relatively challenged. How high can C&P margins in North America actually go?
Dave Lesar: I think, Bill, we have always said that we see no reason that in a reasonably robust gas market that we should not be able to achieve normalized margins. And for us normalized margins would be in the mid-20s. And so obviously we’re going to need help in gas from the gas market. But with the liquids market, I think underpinning sort of how low margins can go and you add to that the efficiencies that we see going on with respect to what we’re going to get out of Battle Red and Frac of the Future. I can see a path there. And as I said, we’re going to have to get a little help from gas. And obviously as we go forward into the balance of the year, so we’ll get some help from Canada.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Okay. And with regard to your prophecy for, I believe, full-year margins for Eastern Hemisphere in the high teens, the only part of that equation which looks still somewhat ambitious to me relative to first half margins is Europe, Africa and CIS which given what we did in the first half and plus a relatively vigorous rate of improvement in the second half of the year and what exactly is the road map for margin improvement in Europe, Africa and CIS as the balance of the year unfolds?
Dave Lesar : Bill, I’ll let Jeff handle that one.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company: Okay, thank you.
Jeff Miller:
 :
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Jim Wicklund -: Good morning, guys. The $32 million mark in the quarter was the improvement in supply chain and all, the continued improvements in Battle Red. I think Battle Red was supposed to go loud this quarter and you’re talking about being implemented in Q1. You guys have spent a lot of money doing this and so we assume that’s an investment. And so how long do you think it will take to recruit the investments you made and when does that quarterly investment start to approach zero?
Credit Suisse: Good morning, guys. The $32 million mark in the quarter was the improvement in supply chain and all, the continued improvements in Battle Red. I think Battle Red was supposed to go loud this quarter and you’re talking about being implemented in Q1. You guys have spent a lot of money doing this and so we assume that’s an investment. And so how long do you think it will take to recruit the investments you made and when does that quarterly investment start to approach zero?
Jeff Miller: Well, the Battle Red project, there are various elements of it that are rolling out each quarter as we go. So we talked about that. We expect the whole project to be completed by the first quarter of 2014. But there are some fairly critical elements that have already rolled out, like timekeeping and things of that nature, there are elements that will begin to rollout even this quarter, this next quarter and third quarter that will have an impact. We’ve attracted, we look at the cost very carefully most of -- as just most of battle that is really around working capital and cash. But there is some fairly large savings in terms of headcount as well. We’re going to give more data for all of you when we have our Analyst Day in November along all these projects since just more specific information about the savings that we see. We are just suffice to say, we are pretty excited about what we see right now, believe very much in these projects and what way we’ll deliver and I think you will be pleasantly surprised when we give that data as well.
Jim Wicklund -: I love being pleasantly surprise, it’s is one of my favorite things.
Credit Suisse: I love being pleasantly surprise, it’s is one of my favorite things.
Dave Lesar: Very good.
Jim Wicklund -: The follow-up question, in the U.S. the concern still exist that we all know that rig count isn’t a very good denominator anymore and even that said, we don’t have a lot of confidence in wells and footage because it’s not reported very well. How much is rig efficiency running? How much is service intensity running, with a flat rig count in the second half of the year? How much can you really grow revenues? Is that a 5% number? Is that a 10% number?
Credit Suisse: The follow-up question, in the U.S. the concern still exist that we all know that rig count isn’t a very good denominator anymore and even that said, we don’t have a lot of confidence in wells and footage because it’s not reported very well. How much is rig efficiency running? How much is service intensity running, with a flat rig count in the second half of the year? How much can you really grow revenues? Is that a 5% number? Is that a 10% number?
Mark McCollum: Yeah. I think we’re still kind of at a leading edge, Jim, with respect to the amount we’ve had drilling in fact anecdotally when we talk to operators, they would describe what’s been done until now as drilling holed and arguably better exploration, even some really big operators have said that they were waiting to really go for a long development. So we’ve seen upper single-digit type improvement in terms of efficiency even in the current year that’s on the back of double-digit efficiency gain last year. So, yeah, I expect there is still headroom to grow around that scenario.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Thanks. Good morning.
Dave Lesar: Good morning Angie.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Really very good to see the continuation of the above peer group growth rates, international revenues and operating income. What drove you essentially modestly increasing your Eastern Hemisphere margin guidance from essentially the mid-teens but now the high-teens where specific regions or countries that appeared to be a bit better than you originally expected?
Dave Lesar: Yeah. Thanks Angie. A lot of that still on the back of what we’ve seen in Asia, I mean, we really come on strong in Asia. We’ve seen the kind of growth throughout the region and have no reason to believe that fairly database. Key contract, I mean, last year we’re seeing those get started and grow into their -- grow into the types of margins we were expecting out of those and then we follow those up with few more rents.
Angie Sedita - UBS: So predominantly coming from Asia, fair?
Dave Lesar: Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. Certainly, we’re leading in Asia.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Okay. And then as a follow up, revenue-related follow up on U.S. pressure pumping. I believe you’re essentially the only company that’s there 100% utilization. In prior conversations you indicated that you believe is that the rest of the market could become balanced by early 2014 and absorb this 20% overhang. Do you still believe that timeline or is that beginning to be a bit pushed out?
Mark McCollum: I think that timeline is beginning to push out just a little bit, that’s on the back of what we’ve seen in terms of the overhang that’s still there, though the thesis we stay with in terms of sort of the longer things go, cannibalization starts to occur of equipment in the market. So I still believe there is the ability to consume the overhang readably overtime, but don’t see that as necessarily a Q1 ’14 event.
Dave Lesar: I think when we initially made that forecast our expectations about rig count growth for the year, Angie, were a bit higher and as you get, as you heard, we’re moderating that a bit and sort of assuming that we’re going over flat rig count. Efficiency levels run higher, rig count lower, I think the combination of both sort of says it probably have a little bit more of, a little longer overhang in this pressure pumping market.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Your margins and revenues in the D&E side for North America were actually lower. Is that all primarily Canada or is there some pricing (inaudible) lot and then what’s the outlook for the remainder of the year in D&E?
Dave Lesar: Lot of that is Canada, that’s a good D&E market for us and obviously with the rig count and breakup slowdown, we feel that more or so have we seen some pricing pressure there. There has been some pricing pressure in those other service lines. But again the efficiency of the drilling activity [taken that out]. It’s the again primarily Canada.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: So margin should go back to the 18% kind of level in the second quarter in North America D&E?
Dave Lesar: May be a little bit softer than that but that’s directionally the right way.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: Now in the Bakken, there was some disruption in activity in the second quarter and completion activity was delayed because of the rains. Did you experience that or -- because that’s a pretty large market for you guys or not?
Dave Lesar: Yes, we did. I mean we had a bit of an impact from that. The weather never helps us through the spring in that market and even in Canada there was the follow-up to breakup with the flooding that happened in Calgary. So it was [better this spring] throughout that area. We certainly don’t expect that to repeat in the second half.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James West of Barclays.
James West - Barclays Capital: Jeff, last quarter you had alluded to in North American stimulation that you guys were going to seek some pricing increases, as we negotiate long-term contracts. Now it seems like you're kind of pushing out when the industry here comes back into the balance. But curious if that still is your intention and as we get into your rollover season here what the feedback has been from your customer base?
Dave Lesar: So let me clarify in terms of the discussions we're having with clients, better wells are still very important. And so that plays to our strength in terms of designing, custom chemistry for the best production, the sub-surface insight that allows us to design the best producing wells. So those continue. But as we said we continue to see some pricing pressure certainly variable across different basins. So I guess the pricing pressure doesn't go away as long as there is the overhang out there of excess equipment. But I think our technical ability to sell into those contracts is still very good.
James West - Barclays Capital: And then maybe just a follow up on international pricing from me. Dave, you mentioned in your comments that it was still -- the gains were still elusive but it seems like there’s the bad behaviors out in the market now but your competitors are at least getting somewhat more constructive and I am curious on why you think given the delayed approach that you're seeing and that your companies are seeing that why that pricing pressure -- pricing power is still elusive?
Dave Lesar: Well, I think, James, a couple of reasons. One is that the price in some of these tenders in the international markets is still so large in terms of revenue stream and duration that everyone tends to sharpen their pencil when they tender and price these things. And number two, the ones that were tendered and launched several years ago all had upsell and new technology strategies in them all of which take a while to work their way through. So as I've said, at this point in time, I think our focus is on increasing margins through better utilization, more efficiency, we've not seen a pricing inflection point even with increased spending because customers are really pretty much taking us slow and steady in terms of their increase and typically slow and steady doesn’t lend itself to a major pricing inflection point because all of a sudden a lot of capacity is stripped out in the market. So as I said, the international market is playing out almost exactly as we saw it and we believe we’ve got a pretty good handle on what's going to happen over the next couple of quarters.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you.
Operator: Your line is now open.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you and good morning. Just wanted to clarify, get some clarification on one thing, I think, Dave you mentioned that there is going to be the Eastern Hemisphere going to be driven by Saudi and Asia? And then, I think, there was a question earlier about the margin improvement and I thought I heard that was being driven mainly by Norway, since now in Africa. I guess my question is, can you give us some update on what you are expecting in terms of potential market improvement contribution from the Middle East to that Eastern Hemisphere dynamic is that primarily coming out of improving profitability out of Iraq or is it coming from improved activity in Saudi?
Dave Lesar: I think, Kurt, Jeff was responding to a question specifically on why the, our Europe, Africa, Russia operation was improving its margins and I think discussion on Norway, Continental Europe, North Sea was reflective of that. If you sort of pull all the way back in terms of the Eastern Hemisphere, even though we are proud of our operation in Europe, Africa, CIS, the action really is in the Middle East and Asia right now. And so our Middle East operations will continue to expand. We are really happy with what we have going in Saudi, our operations in Iraq have stabilized. And then as Jeff has mentioned, almost all the way across Asia, we are seeing great success. So, we are really happy with our Eastern Hemisphere portfolio right now. We haven’t mentioned some of the African countries but they continue to do better. So, overall, I think that across the Board we are happy with where we are in Eastern Hemisphere just a summer driving forward a little bit faster.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. And then thanks, Dave, let me follow up to that, with respect to Iraq, you have a general timeframe as the when you think Iraq may become neutral or net neutral to your Middle East/Asia margins?
Dave Lesar: It’s neutral now. In fact it was breakeven last quarter, slightly profitable, it’s more profitable this quarter. We are little positive on the outlook for Iraq, take it will be little slower and more measured as we go forward, but certainly more profitable.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Dave Lesar: Hi. Brad.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: Could you guys just speak a little bit more specifically to what’s happening in Egypt?
Dave Lesar: Yeah.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: From your business perspective.
Dave Lesar: Yeah. The -- obviously it’s not going and hitting on all cylinders at this point in time. The customers have dialed back a little bit. One of the big issues we have is because of the concerns the government have, the ability to move around in the desert has been somewhat hampered, especially the ability to move explosives around and obviously, explosives are key to our business in terms of completing the wells. And so, that’s just made the logistics of doing our operations there a little bit more difficult. But it hasn’t been shutdown but it clearly has been ratcheted back and obviously when you ratchet back and the revenue and add a logistical cost, it really starts to impact your margins more than it impacts your revenue.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: Right. But you, sorry, so you guys, you have kept all the crew and whatever expect crew is in country and…
Dave Lesar: Yeah. We have actually very, very few expects in place like Egypt. But we have maintained our crew, that’s correct.
Brad Handler - Jefferies: Got you. Okay. I don’t really to follow up, Mark, what was the shares outstanding at the end of 2Q?
Mark McCollum: That’s a great question. We had 917 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The part -- when you try to do the averaging to the quarter, right, most of the billion dollar, share buyback happened in May and June, and so the averaging effect had a little bit different effect.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Doug Becker - Bank of America: Thanks. Jeff, I think, you indicated 50% of the frac we will have the [Q2] promise by the end of 2015, which I think implies about 50% conversation of the fleet over 3.5 years give or take? Also just trying to gauge if it’s reasonable to assume that the full fleet will be converted in a total six to seven years, kind of a similar environment to what we’ve seen over the last couple of year. And if everything fell into place, how quickly could you have Q10 pumps in the entire fleet?
Dave Lesar : Yeah Doug, that’s the right pace. We expect to be by ‘15 at about half. But what I would say is castings that we’re doing this sort of ratably as the market allows and as equipment as they’re taken outside the U.S., equipment retirements occur. But we have continued to retire equipment in order to get the equipment into the field. So that’s the right pace, kind of in the five to six year pace, but that would to a certain degree be limited by market. And we wouldn’t get over our skies if the market didn’t allow it.
Doug Becker - Bank of America: How quickly could you -- if 550 gas, international commissions are ramping up, how quickly could you in the perfect scenario…?
Dave Lesar : Very quickly. I mean that’s, my reference to our manufacturing capability allows us really to turn more quickly than probably anyone in the marketplace around bringing equipment forward. So we would love to have the opportunity to do that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Anderson of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Dave Anderson - JP Morgan : Hey Dave, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned something about 50% of drilling in the U.S. is on pad drilling. I was a little surprised by the number. It seems a little higher than I was thinking. Was that a number for Halliburton and if so, can you just tell me where do you think that number goes say by the end of 2014?
Dave Lesar:
 :
Dave Anderson - JP Morgan : And I was just wondering if you can help me quantify this impact. Let's just say you take five wells on pad drilling which is five wells kind of standalone. How would you think that your margins should be different between those two wells or is it going to reduce cost or whatever the best way to measure that impact is?
Dave Lesar: The margins are better on the back -- the number of turns we get on the equipment. So if we’re rigged up on a single location, we have even particular equipment that allows us to move from well to well without having to move the equipment at all. So if we think in terms of start to finish or time between wells, we are just working more on a pad and the larger the pad, the more we work as opposed to rigging down and moving away to somewhere else.
Dave Anderson - JP Morgan : So is that like a 20% to 30% increase in margins, something on those lines?
Dave Lesar: Well, I think, obviously we know what that amount is, but we’re not going to tell the world.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is now open.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering: Hi, good morning.
Dave Lesar: Hi, Jeff.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering: The discussion around Q3 North American outlook top line growth being driven Canada and Gulf of Mexico coming back, but you had implied that the U.S. land business kind of trajectory into the course of Q2 is pretty flattish. Is that correct? And I guess, one of my questions.
Dave Lesar:
 :
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering: I guess so was that improvement April through June that was better than the March [through May]? I guess it was around…
Dave Lesar: Yes, on a state count basis, we’re seeing an improvement. So we’re back kind of consistent with what we saw middle of late last -- middle of sort of third quarter of last year. So I mean we are seeing the activity rebound.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering: Then another question I had is just around Latin America. So in this, we see the revenue improvement in the second half of the year, if that was to kind of bounds around what's reasonable, is it fair to think kind of low side case of revenue growth of 5%...
Dave Lesar: I think they are 5%.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering: … in case of 10% full year in Latin America year-over-year?
Dave Lesar: I think they are 5% numbers per year.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Scott Gruber - Bernstein: Good morning.
Dave Lesar: Good morning.
Mark McCollum: Good morning.
Scott Gruber - Bernstein: Given the more temporary outlook here for rebalancing of the pumping market, I assume you are not considering extending the size of your U.S. pumping fleet during the first half of '14? I assume that's correct because you didn't increase your CapEx for the second half of the year?
Dave Lesar: That would be correct. Our expectation is to kind of stay where we are.
Scott Gruber - Bernstein: Okay. So how do you think over the medium term about that choice between continuing to improve margins which is clearly the goal today and the opportunity to take share in the U.S. market, personally I think that the U.S. market should be a good market over the medium term as the industry moves to monetize cheap natural gas. Are you thinking about a certain margin level that you want to get to before you start adding capacity in your -- above your cost of capital today? Are we getting back to this normalized margin or we should think about before you start increasing your CapEx?
Dave Lesar: Well, we’ll start with returns first. So everything which is in this business is around returns and so as long as we are happy with our returns and we are getting equipments to work, we wouldn't take share at the expense of returns. I really don't know that, I mean, with -- on the back of the things that we are dealing with Battle Red and Frac of the Future, I don't see those few things as mutually explosive. Some of the systemic things we are doing allow us to grow share even with the equipment we have or with the same level of equipment that we have.
Mark McCollum: Yeah. I think there are two things to consider, Scott, one is that with pad drilling in the efficiencies that our equipment is working today. As we look at it, you are creating effective utilizable space on a calendar, as we work faster and more efficiently. The second thing, which is I think, unique to Halliburton, remember we are retiring equipment as we roll out our Frac of the Future. But that equipment was working today, still viable equipment and right now because we don’t see the need for excess equipment, we’re parking it possibly destining that equipment for our international operations along the way. But, if the right opportunity presents itself along the way, we have the ability to redeploy some of that equipment back into the U.S. market or not pull it out of service in order to capture share, while we see that we have an opportunity to continue to give very good returns and work for the right customers and the right basins with the right technologies.
Kelly Youngblood: [Sam], we’ll take one more question?
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Robin Shoemaker of Citi. Your line is now open.
Robin Shoemaker - Citi: Thank you. I want to ask about Mexico, go back to Mexico for a minute, the contract that you won in Chicontepec, I believe, you talked about cost recovery. And then I think there is a fee-per-barrel arrangement after that. So, can you describe exactly how that works and why there was --- why you believe there wasn't a much broader interest among the oil service companies in these Chicontepec blocks?
Dave Lesar: Yeah. The cost per barrel or the fee-per-barrel is really the smaller piece of that type of project. Really, it’s a situation where we provide services into the project and then earn cost of recovery to get paid at what we believe are certainly accretive margins to our business. I think the interest by others, I can't say what others were necessarily interested in or not, but I would say that this is very difficult work. It takes a lot of reservoir inside in order to determine which field and how to produce over time and a full suite of services that it takes to do all of that work. So, we won that -- the Humapa that we won, we are really comfortable with where we are and really the last thing that prevents broad group to really enter that is quite frankly the capital over those processes required to embark on these types of things.
Robin Shoemaker - Citi: I see. Okay. So, on these increased projects that you described that are coming up in Mexico, are some of these projects that will involve, sort of, high-end technologies or are these going to be really very competitive types of tenders?
Dave Lesar: Well, it could be both. I think that a combination over describing our all of the integrated drilling, not like the incentivized rounds that we just finished talking about but drilling wells for [four p-max] and a lump sum type fashion and those range from some more simple to some that are actually quite complex. So I think we’ll see competitive -- it will be competitive just given the size of the activity. But the type of technology required I do think will be important as those projects are with.
Operator: Thank you. And at this time I'd like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.
Kelly Youngblood: Okay, thanks everybody for your participation. We’ll be doing follow up calls over the next couple of days. And Sam with that you can go ahead and close the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions.] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I’d now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Thanks, operator. Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2013 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the first quarter results is available on Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Jeff Miller, COO; and Mark McCollum, CFO. Tim Probert, president of strategy and corporate development will also be available today for follow-up calls. I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release announcing the fourth quarter results, which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items on our financial results unless otherwise noted.  We welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?
David Lesar: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin by saying that our results for the first quarter played out pretty much as we said it would on our last call. Our international operations were impacted by the normal seasonal drop off in the first quarter, but revenues and operating income expanded significantly compared to the prior year as we outgrew our primary competitors. Sequentially, our North America margins improved substantially as we worked through the guar issue and got our equipment back to work as customers refreshed their budgets. Total company revenue of $7 billion was a record for a Halliburton first quarter, and operating income was $902 million. Our Sperry Drilling, Mult-Chem, and Baroid product lines achieved record revenues this quarter and from an operating income perspective, Baroid and drill bits also set new records.  I’m very pleased with our results in North America, where we saw nearly a 400 basis point sequential improvement to our margins as we work through our remaining high-priced guar inventory, saw activity levels rebound from the dramatic drop off seen at the end of the fourth quarter, and began to see cost savings materialize from our Battle Red and Frac of the Future initiatives. The U.S. land rig count averaged 3% lower in the first quarter versus the prior quarter. However, despite reduced overall rig activity, horizontal rigs were up sequentially, and we expect this trend to continue, especially in areas like the Permian Basin. Coupled with the increased adoption of pad drilling and 24-hour operations, we expect to see even higher service intensity.  We believe that the oil directed rig count will grow moderately from current levels as our customers continue to evaluate the pace which they can more efficiently drill in complete wells. We believe this continued shift towards efficiency will bode well for us in the coming years, as no other company has the ability to execute factory type operations as efficiently as Halliburton. Recently, we have seen an uptick in natural gas prices. However, our outlook for gas activity this year has not materially changed. We believe we will need to see sustained pricing improvements before gas activity will meaningfully increase. With the exception of the Marcellus, where we are already very active, our view is that natural gas drilling will not be a major activity driver in 2013 in the U.S.  The availability of associated gas and shut in gas to meet market demand will likely delay a meaningful uptick in new well drilling. If we see improvement in the gas basins, it will be late in the year, although we are becoming increasingly optimistic about gas activity in 2014.  That all being said, let me remind you that we called the fourth quarter as the bottom for North America margins, and our first quarter results bear that out. Even with the spring breakup in Canada, we continue to expect North America margins will expand over the balance of 2013, subject to the usual year-end seasonality.  Turning now to the international markets, we continue to successfully execute our growth strategy. Relative to the first quarter of 2012, we grew revenues by 21%, which is the highest among our primary peers, and is clear evidence of our expanding global market share.  In fact, compared to our two primary competitors, we have delivered leading year over year international growth now for the last four quarters. In addition, eastern hemisphere grew operating income by an outstanding 39% relative to the first quarter of 2012, which is also the highest in our peer group.  We did experience the typical sequential decline in revenue and margins during the first quarter due to the absence of seasonally higher year-end software and product sales as well as the normal first quarter seasonal weakness in the North Sea, Eurasia, and Australia.  Our thinking for the full year internationally remains consistent. We are forecasting year over year international revenue growth in the low teens, and continue to expect our average full year international margins will be in the upper teens. In Latin America, I’m happy to announce that we’ve received a final award approval from Petrobras for both the high tech directional drilling and testing contracts. These four-year contracts with extensions for up to another four years include drilling, logging while drilling, and integrated test and services in both the pre-salt and post-salt formations in the Brazilian offshore market. In both these cases, we won the leading market position in Brazil, and more importantly, in the drilling award, we won the largest package, even though we were not the lowest bidder. Together, the potential estimated value of these hard-fought contracts is more than $2 billion, which is expected to significantly increase our position in the largest deep water market in the world. These wins are a testament to the ongoing success of our strategy to provide long term advanced technology solutions to our customers will increase in a leadership position in the global deep water market.  There’s no doubt Latin America was a disappointment from a margin standpoint in the first quarter. But the issues were one-off in nature as we saw activity delays, incurred increased severance costs in Argentina, cost to mobilize in our new deep water contracts in Brazil, and a significant rate count reduction in our Mexico IPM projects as we wait on our large contracts to retender. I fully expect Latin America margins to improve moderately in the second quarter and to average in the upper teens for the second half of the year.  Our growth strategy going forward remains the same. It is clearly working well, and does not need to be changed. We will continue to focus on strengthening our global position in deep water, unconventionals, and mature fields, and we continue to be relentlessly focused on industry leading returns. I am optimistic about the remainder of the year, our ability to continue rebuilding North American margins, and realizing continued revenue and margin growth in our international business. Now I’ll turn the call over to Jeff to provide operational highlights. 
Jeff Miller: Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. Let me begin with an overview of our first quarter results. Latin America revenues grew 21% compared to the same quarter last year, driven by an expanding revenue base in Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela, and from a product line perspective, the growth was driven by Sperry Drilling, Baroid Fluids, and consulting and project management. Year over year, operating income was down 11%, primarily due to activity delays and higher costs in Argentina and mobilization costs for the recent contract wins in Brazil.  In addition to the deep water Brazil wins David discussed already, we had several highlights with unconventional activity in Latin America this quarter. In Argentina, we provided integrated completion services for an independent operator on the largest volume shale well ever pumped in the country. This quarter also marked the first international application of PermStim, our premium guar alternative, where we designed a customer fluid treatment on a shale well in north Mexico.  The eastern hemisphere headline is that compared to the first quarter of 2012, revenue grew by 21% and operating income increased 39%. And though we experienced the typical sequential decline in revenue and margin during the first quarter, we did not see the severity of weather disruption typically experienced during the first quarter. In the Middle East Asia region, compared to prior year, revenue and operating income increased 25% and 51% respectively. We saw the largest growth in the Australia, China, and Saudi Arabia markets. This improved performance reflects the successful startup and execution of contract awards throughout 2012. Specific to Saudi Arabia, we saw over 30% revenue growth relative to the first quarter of 2012, and it’s expected to be one of our top growth areas in 2013. Notably during the quarter, we received a direct award for two additional rigs on our south guar project, and we deployed the first complete rapid suite sliding sleeve system in the country. To support further unconventional development in the region, we are look forward to opening our [unintelligible] gas technology center in Saudi Arabia later this year  In addition, operations in Iraq posted a profitable quarter, and as we refine our portfolio of projects, we expect operations to remain profitable for the year. Also of note, our Multi-Chem product line took a significant step forward on its eastern hemisphere footprint, expanding operations with the win in India.  This quarter also marked the opening of our completion technology and manufacturing center in Singapore. The center is already delivering high quality completion tools through our eastern hemisphere operations and helping to drive additional revenue growth and cost improvements.  Turning to Europe, Africa, and CIS, relative to the first quarter of 2012, we saw revenue and operating income increase 17% and 25% respectively. The improvement was driven by higher activity levels in the North Sea, Eurasia, Nigeria, and Central Africa markets. In Angola, we recently secured a wireline formation evaluation logging contract on a deep water pre-salt block for a large independent operator and in Norway, we were awarded a multiyear contract with Statoil to improve production through multilateral solutions on a mature offshore field. Across the Europe, Africa, and CIS region, we’re seeing an uptick in the adoption of unconventional technology. For example, we’re seeing increased use of multistage fracturing across the region, and expanded application of rotary steerables and sliding sleeve technology in developing the tight oil fields of Russia. These are markets with terrific potential for unconventional development, and we are excited about further adoption of our technologies to help clients develop their resources. Moving to North America, revenue was down 1% compared to the previous quarter. That’s relative to a 3% sequential drop in the U.S. land rig count. Operating income was up 30% sequentially, driven by lower water cost, increasing service intensity, and early cost savings resulting from our Frac of the Future and Battle Red initiatives. Starting with guar, the quarter shaped up as expected, with large low-cost guar deliveries early in the quarter, significantly reducing our full quarter average cost. Given the first quarter exit rate for completion activity, our average guar cost should be at market rate by the end of the second quarter. At the end of the first quarter, approximately 85% of our crews were under long term contracts, and about three-quarters were working 24-hour operations.  At this point, I’d like to say a few words on stimulation pricing. As we finish the quarter, virtually all of our long term hydraulic fracturing contracts have been renewed. Due to the timing of contract startups, we will see some additional pricing impact on our margins in the second quarter as some recently renegotiated contracts went into effect at the beginning of April. However, we believe the worst of the pricing pressure is behind us.  To support our focus on improving pricing trends, we will continue to execute our stated strategy around surface efficiencies, custom chemistry, and subsurface technology, delivering differentiated services, which generate superior returns over the long term. Our fleets are sold out today, and are aligned with customers where we can create the most value for them and deliver the best returns for Halliburton.  I believe our first quarter performance indicates we’re on the right track, and as a result, I’m not going to comment on any tit for tat reports on pricing because I feel they are normally self-serving and anecdotal, and I expect that you see them the same way. With respect to our other product lines, we’ve experienced some pricing pressure in specific basins, but there has not been a meaningful impact on our margins. The pressure’s been focused on cementing, [unintelligible] wireline, and directional drilling, primarily in areas with lower technology requirements and therefore smaller competitors in the market. However, we believe that as activity levels continue to improve throughout the year, this pricing pressure will subside and our cost optimization initiatives will help offset any further pricing pressures on those service lines.  We’re also beginning to have more meaningful discussions with our clients around the technology to make better wells, which we believe may signal the leading edge of pricing improvement.  We’re increasingly optimistic that even in a market with flat or moderately improved rig count, we will continue to see a shift to pad well activity and more 24-hour operations. It is our view that the resulting increased well count and stage count could absorb a meaningful percentage of the excess horsepower and help drive service intensity across the product lines. In the Gulf of Mexico, first quarter activity was impacted by [bolt] maintenance issues on [BOP stacks]. We expect strong revenue and profit growth for the year, but weighted more to the second half. We believe we will continue to grow our market share as rigs move to a completion cycle on new wells, and we are well-positioned to lead the market and lower tertiary completions. A good example of how we differentiate ourselves is our enhanced single trip multizone system, which can quickly isolate and stimulate multiple zones in a lower tertiary formation, saving operators weeks of rig time and substantially improving the economics of these ultra-deep wells. For a major operator in the Gulf, we’ve already documented an average savings of 18 rig days per well by applying this single-trip technology. I like our position in North America, and believe it’s only going to get better going forward. The guar issue is largely behind us, and we anticipate better cost optimization will result from our strategic initiatives. We anticipate activity levels will improve through a combination of modest rig count growth and continued drilling efficiencies over the course of the year. I want to conclude with our key areas of focus. First, we are committed to improving our North America margins. We’ve seen a dramatic improvement this quarter, but we’re not finished. Second, we’re committed to growing our international revenues and margins and achieving a better geographic balance in our business going forward. And finally, we remain focused on capital discipline and ensuring that we generate the highest returns in our peer group. And now Mark will provide some additional financial commentary. Mark? 
Mark McCollum: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. Our results for the first quarter reflect a $637 million net of tax accrual to increase our contingency reserve related to the Macondo multidistrict litigation. The accrual this quarter is in addition to the $191 million net of tax accrual made in the first quarter of 2012.  Over the past month or so, we’ve participated in court-facilitated settlement discussions with some of the parties included in the multidistrict litigation, with the goal of resolving a substantial portion of the private claims against us in this matter.  These discussions are at an advanced stage, although they’ve not yet resulted in a settlement, and the accrual is based on where we are in the negotiations at the present time. Our most recent offering includes both stock and cash, with the cash components payable over an extended period of time.  We’re pursuing these settlement discussions in earnest, because we believe that an early and reasonably valued resolution is in the best interest of our shareholders. However, a settlement of this magnitude is complex, and requires the other settling parties to be reasonable on their part too.  From a litigation standpoint, we continue to believe that we have substantial legal arguments and defenses against any liability, and that BP is contractually required to indemnify us as described more fully in our public filings. Therefore, if our settlement discussions are not successful, we’re fully prepared to see this matter to conclusion in the courts. As the [MBL] trial and other investigations progress, we’re constantly monitoring and evaluating developments and it’s possible that we may need to adjust our reserve estimate up or down in the future. Our reserve estimate also does not include any potential recoveries from our insurers. Because we’re engaged in ongoing settlement discussions and active trial proceedings, we will not be taking any Macondo related questions today. Excluding the charge related to the Macondo litigation, our corporate and other expense totaled $120 million this quarter and included approximately $37 million for continued investment in our Battle Red, completion tools, manufacturing, and other strategic initiatives. Some of these initiatives will continue throughout 2013, but the related costs should begin to decline in the second half of the year.  We anticipate the impact of these investments will again be approximately $0.03 per share after tax in the second quarter. Our legal costs have also increased during the Macondo trial, so in total, we anticipate that corporate expenses will average between $120 million and $130 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. I’m pleased to say that we’re already beginning to see the payoff of the investments we’ve made over the last few years, such as the recent opening of the Singapore manufacturing center, a material reduction in our effective tax rate, and finally cost optimization related to our Battle Red initiative. Next quarter, we intend to give you a further quantification of the expected savings we can realize from our Battle Red and Frac of the Future programs. During the quarter, we were positively impacted by retroactive federal tax benefits of $50 million, resulting in an adjusted first quarter effective tax rate of approximately 23%, excluding the charge related to the Macondo litigation.  Due to the benefits from the strategic realignment of our international operations we completed last year, and the continued expansion of our international business, for the remaining quarters of the year, we expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 29%, a 300-basis point improvement over our 2012 rate.  Also during the quarter, we announced a 39% increase to our dividend and the commencement of stock repurchases under our existing buyback authorization of $1.7 billion. Going forward, our intention is for the dividend to represent at least 15% to 20% of our net income.  As a result of the Macondo settlement discussions in the first quarter, we were unable to repurchase a significant amount of shares. We plan, however, to be much more aggressive in our second quarter repurchase activity, following the anticipated completion of our SEC filings later this week. Our capital expenditure guidance of approximately $3 billion for the full year 2013 remains unchanged. For our international bus, as we move into the second quarter, we’re anticipating a moderate improvement in revenue as we recover from the first quarter seasonal drop off. And we expect margins to approach the mid teens. For North America, we anticipate a modest improvement in the U.S. rig count in the second quarter. However, given the stronger U.S. activity levels in the first quarter, coupled with the typical second quarter drop off in Canadian activity due to spring break up, we only expect a slight improvement in sequential revenues for the second quarter.  North America margins should be positively impacted by another 100 basis points or so, as our average guar cost continues to decline to market levels. We anticipate also that marginal improvement from U.S. activity levels will be largely offset by pricing from late first quarter contract renewals and by Canadian activity disruptions due to spring breakup. Now I’ll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing comments.
David Lesar: Okay, thanks, Mark. So in summary, we’re very proud of our strong year over year international growth, which was the highest in our peer group and a solid proof point that we are executing well against our strategy. Our overall international outlook for the year has not changed. We expect revenues will grow in the area of the low teens, and expect full year margins will average in the upper teens.  Specifically, for Latin America, we had some temporary activity declines and one-off charges across the region, but it doesn’t change our outlook for the full year. The North America headwinds from last year are largely behind us, and we are optimistic about activity levels and continued margin improvement for the remainder of the year. And lastly, with respect to ongoing Macondo settlement discussions, we are working hard to come to a reasonable settlement that will be in the best interest of our shareholders. So at that point, let’s open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from James West of Barclays. Your line is now open. 
James West - Barclays Capital: Dave, when I saw you back in January and February, there were two things that really stuck out in my mind from our conversations. One was that on the international side you talked about the opportunity set being really the largest you’d ever seen.  And then number two, that this was really the time to test pricing in the international markets. I’m wondering if we could kind of revisit that, if you could talk about that opportunity set. Is it still as large as you thought a couple of months ago? And then really the second is on the pricing side, are you starting to see some more pricing discipline from your competition? Or are you starting to see pricing rise? 
David Lesar : Yeah, I think with respect to the first comment, the opportunity set in the international markets remains as large as it has been, and I think the largest set that we’ve certainly seen within recent history. So those opportunities haven’t gone away.  I think the other point that I should make is that with the Brazil tendering process behind us, the opportunity set is a whole lot of sort of medium-sized types of opportunities. It’s not any big mega types of tenders out there. Which gives us and our competitors, I think, an opportunity to sort of test where we are in terms of pricing.  If you look at where we are bidding today, and where we’re winning work, I think we certainly have hit the bottom in terms of international pricing. Believe me, it’s still competitive. But I believe that we’re seeing that it is starting to turn up.
James West - Barclays Capital : Okay, and then maybe just one follow up on Mexico. We’ve got some contract retendering that has to go through. How long is that process expected to take before you can get back to work there?
Jeff Miller : There are a couple of big things that happen sort of mid year. So I would expect that through the process we’ll see some sorting out of budgets early, at the end of Q1, and then tenders mid year. It’s probably later in the year, before budgets are refreshed and back to work. But I would expect during the balance of this year we’d see that.
David Lesar : I think one other thing I might add is that on these contracts we’ve gotten extensions on a number of them, but it’s been at a rig count that’s less than what we had been working at while we wait on these tenders to come forward. And that’s really part of the reason that the margins have got squeezed. But as I said, we look at that as sort of a one-off issue.
Operator: Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. 
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs: My question relates to North America. It seems the margin improvement was much higher than we expected. It feels better than what you expected as well. Could you provide, Mark, what was the source of the upward surprise in margins in the first quarter?
Mark McCollum : As we look at it, we thought probably just given a lower level of activity expected in Q1 that we would only get a couple hundred basis points from guar savings. I think the Street knows that we had said that we thought we could get 400 to 450 basis points of improvement in our North America margins from the turn in our guar inventories. We, I think in the first quarter, just given the higher activity levels, got about 300 basis points of that savings on guar, which leaves the remaining 100 or so for the second quarter, which I talked about in my prepared comments. The rest of it, really when you look at it, is activity-related. Very strong activity for us. We got our crews back to work much faster than we thought we would on the pressure pumping side. When you look across our drilling and evaluation divisions, they did extremely well. We saw almost 200 basis points of marginal improvement across D&E as well.  So all the activity increase for us just well exceeded the pressure that we saw from continued pricing that we had from rolling some of our pressure pumping contracts in the first quarter. 
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs : And this is the first time that I’ve heard you guys be positive on the pricing front as well. What gives you that confidence that pricing could pick up later in the year?
David Lesar : The conversations that we’re having with clients these days are becoming more geared towards making better wells, which leads very quickly into a discussion around chemistry and chemistry application. And those are applications of our technology, and so maybe not today, but that’s the leading edge of the right discussion to have with a company like Halliburton, because we do make better wells when we use that technology. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor Pickering. Your line is now open. 
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. :  The reported rig counts, we can see activity has trended pretty flattish over the last month in the U.S. Just wanted to hear kind of your discussion, your viewpoint, on activity second and third quarter, and what gives you confidence there will be uptick from here?
David Lesar : A combination of things. We see increases in pad drilling. That obviously drives service intensity for us. You heard my discussion around leading edge of technology application. And those things combined start to take us to more efficient operations where we’re using our equipment.  The second thing is really alignment with the clients that appreciate our efficiency level. And so as we position our equipment in the basins and with the clients that want that sort of efficiency, we expect to see improvement. So in spite of, say, rig count modestly increasing, both our share of it and the speed with which that activity happens can increase. 
Jeff Miller : When you look at the well count, yeah, overall it didn’t look that great, but the horizontal rig count was up. If you look inside of that, the rig count went up with the customers whom we work for. A lot of the majors.  And then thirdly, we focus more dramatically on well count. And when we look at activity across the quarter, well count was up and so was our service intensity around stage counts. And so that drives improved performance, as Jeff said, when you’re aligned with the right customers doing the right type of work with good technology. 
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. : And my second question is just as you look out, if you think about exiting this year, North American margins were quite a bit better than I had thought. We’re going to see international margin improve during the course of the year. I would still expect international margins to exceed North America to exit the year. Do you agree with that?
Jeff Miller : No, I wouldn’t necessarily agree with that. I think it will be a horse race as the year progresses. Certainly North America is getting better, but we’ve still got excess capacity in the North America market that we’ll be dealing with, so there is some pricing pressure that they’re facing. Right now, as the international operations expand and on their base and the improvement that we see, I think that they could actually eclipse the North America margin in the year. But it will be very, very close.
Operator: Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open. 
Angeline Sedita - UBS:  Just to be clear, when you’re talking about North America and modest price increases as customers adopt new technology. Is this specifically in frac? Or in other product lines?
David Lesar : This is all product lines. So this is about making better wells, which is a function of well construction and completions. But I will say these are the leading edge of discussions around how to do it. So very encouraged by the discussions, which means there’s an appreciation for the technology of how better producing wells are made.
Angeline Sedita - UBS : And then on North American frac capacity, assuming that we do see another 6-7% growth in the rig count in 2013, and as we’ve discussed here, growth in the well count and, i.e., rig efficiencies, do you believe that the frac market could actually be balanced by early 2014 or even late 2013? 
David Lesar : Really Q1 played out very close to what we thought it would, maybe a little bit better activity. We always thought, as we looked ahead, that there still would be some excess capacity in the frac market, maybe in the 10-15% level, too much frac capacity. That could get absorbed very, very quickly in the early part of 2014 based on what we’re seeing.
Operator: And our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Co. Your line is now open. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.:  Back to North America here real quickly. You guys have addressed this in some facets, but not necessarily in others. I guess my question is you came into the year with a decent inventory [of drill bit], uncompleted wells. That helped propel better completions activity versus drilling activity in Q1. Drilling activity hasn’t been all that brisk year to date. And yet you guys are waxing confident about the runway remaining for the next quarter or so. At least that’s my interpretation. Can you give us some more granularity as to which markets look better? Which markets look worse? And specific discussions you’re having with customers? Because it sounds like the visibility you see is more nebulous to the market. 
David Lesar : Let me take this one. I think it’s not a matter of geography. It really is a matter of your customer base. And we’ve said for years we only deal with what we call the fair way players in the U.S., North America market. These are the folks that are going to keep rigs up and their budgets up, through thick and thin, but also are those that are dealing with some of the lowest lease cost opportunities there.  So we pride ourselves on our ability to sort of pick and choose who we work for, and we do that. And so it really doesn’t matter where they’re working. And I really wouldn’t get too concentrated and focused on geography. It’s really what our customer base is. And I think has Mark has said, our customers that we’re working for are increasing their rig counts. They’re increasing their budgets, and we sort of know what their plans are for the remainder of this year.  And that’s what gives us the increasing confidence of our position in North America from a margin accretion standpoint, notwithstanding the fact that there are a lot of other companies and customers out there that may not feel so confident. We just happen to feel really strong and really confident about the customer base that we have. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. : And then the follow up is on international. Your guidance sort of low teens for the year. You’ve got a 21% year over year increase for the first quarter in terms of revenue growth, which implies a pretty good slowdown with year over year growth relative to Q1 for the balance of the year. Is that conservatism? Or is that based upon conviction that the year over year rate of growth is actually going to slow that much? It’s still commendable, but slower than Q1.
David Lesar : It is truly slower than Q1, but I think that as we look year over year, Q1 in 2012 was a bit more dramatically down. And so we knew that Q1 probably would be a little bit higher percentage. As we look ahead also we think that particularly in Latin America things are going to move a little bit slower, possibly, than some would forecast. So maybe it has a little bit of conservatism in it, but we think it’s a pretty fair forecast, just based on, historically, what you see customers do from this point forward. And remember, last year we saw some pretty significant growth sequentially in our international markets coming off of Q1. So it really is in comparison to last year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your line is now open. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC: Dave, a question for you. There was a lot of chatter the last couple of days, at least from one of your competitors, getting very optimistic about the acceleration in the international marketplace as you get through the second half of the year. And I think a lot of that is being driven by the prospects of the Saudis to pick up rigs. I know you’re pretty close to the situation out there, very close. I wonder if you can put it into context for us compared to what transpired in Saudi in ‘06/’07 into ’08, how you would compare that to what you see happening now, and then what kind of impact you would expect that to have on capacity and pricing and opportunities going out late ’13 and into ’14?
David Lesar : Well, I think, sort of on a broad scale, as I indicated before, we are very excited about the potential in the eastern hemisphere markets at this point in time. And we are very optimistic, specifically, about opportunities in Saudi Arabia. If you look at the myriad of areas that Aramco was looking at increasing: gas drilling, work over areas, the whole area of lump sum turnkey projects. And we’re embedded with Aramco in all of those.  So I think if you look at the opportunities in the Red Sea, where we recently won some work with Saudi Aramco. So we’re very excited about that market in particular, and obviously we’ll get more than our share of that market as it comes around. We’re in active negotiations with them right now about several projects. Obviously, we can’t talk about them until they’re awarded, but we’re very optimistic about where we stand on them.  So I believe that Saudi is a bit of a microcosm of what we see the whole international market playing out as, which is very positive over the next several years. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC : And maybe in that context, is there a parallel we can draw to what transpired in ’06, ’07 and the acceleration in bus and margins and activity and pricing and everything else that drove the sector for a good two, two and a half year period?
David Lesar : I certainly hope so.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. 
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Jeff, you talk about service intensity. And we all know that rig count is becoming increasingly passé as a metric. And I understand the improvements in technology in your customer base that drive your business. But have you all come up with a number? Is service intensity growing by 5%? 10%? Is there a number that you all are kind of looking to put on that? 
David Lesar : We look at different metrics, so numbers of stages and different things that we see out there. And so when we look at it, we see it improving. I’m not going to give you, necessarily, a particular metric, but we’re forecasting a 9-10% improvement in efficiency of rigs, which gets to what drives the underlying numbers of stages, numbers of activity. 
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse : And I know we talked a little bit about rig count and all, but spending. Do you think that North America spending will go up this year, through the rest of the year? There’s been a great deal of question as to whether the rig count is going to move. And like I said, rig count doesn’t matter. And the number of sources we have for footage and wells are kind of sparse. What do you think spending is going to do for the industry overall for North America for the rest of the year?
David Lesar : I think the actual spending is probably going to be flat, and I think that’s a function of spending the money faster, which our clients will be able to do. So I don’t see a big increase in actual spend, necessarily, across the board.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.  
Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein: We’ve seen Halliburton definitely take the lead here in pushing for more 24-hour work and pumping in the states. It’s obviously great for asset turns and margins. But you can also complete more stages when you work around the clock. Have you guys gone out and looked at the efficiency gain which is being realized by your pumping fleet, or maybe the pumping fleet as a whole here in the U.S., and how that will impact tightening of the market?
David Lesar : You know, our strategy has been to implement our Q10 pump capability. We’ve [feathered] that end of the market, sort of ratably, as we’ve retired equipment. But we believe we will see probably a 20% improvement in our efficiency on the back of our technology. So when I think about capital efficiency and capital required to address our piece of the market, I believe it will be more competitive than others, certainly in that space.
Jeff Miller :  Let me just add one more comment. Obviously the impact of 24-hour operations adds to the efficiency of the industry, but it also eats up your equipment two or three times faster than your traditional way of doing pressure pumping does. So that in itself also will lend to the consumption of any excess capacity that’s in the market, just because the useful life of your equipment tends to require you to have more maintenance and more ongoing cost. But it does grind the equipment up faster and that tends to take some of the equipment out of the market a lot faster than it might historically have.
Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein : And that 20% figure, that’s primarily related to less backup capacity? Or is that a combination of less backup capacity and more stages executed per week, per month?
Jeff Miller : That’s, actually, in our view, the same thing, stages less horsepower.
David Lesar : The Q10 runs at higher rate of horsepower than traditional pumps and so if you just look through it, you just need 20% less, based on what we’re seeing it run in the marketplace. It means fewer trucks.
Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein : If I could ask a quick question on Mexico. You mentioned a little bit slower going here in terms of growth rate in Latin America. What’s your outlook for gas-related activity in Mexico, particularly in the Burgos. You know, Mexico is importing more low-cost gas here from the U.S.
David Lesar : I think it’s still a bit of a science experiment in northern Mexico right now. As we’ve talked about over the last couple of calls, we’ve done some fracs. I think we did the first frac in northern Mexico. And the results have not been made public on that. So we won’t do that today. But I think you can consider it as sort of a prospective science experiment at this point in time. But we are optimistic about what might develop as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. 
David Anderson - JPMorgan: Everyone seems to be downplaying the potential improvement in natural gas activity. You did on this call as well. [unintelligible] price has been down about $4 for over a month, and I’m just kind of wondering, some of your [competitors] are starting to lock in hedges. Why won’t we start to see activity increasing soon. You talk about your customer base. You stuck with those guys. I’m just kind of curious what they’re saying. What do they need to see to start getting out there again.
David Lesar : I think you’re right. For $4 plus gas, where they can lock hedges in, is getting to the point where a lot of these fair way players actually can be quite profitable from a return standpoint on these. I think what we want to convey today is that we’re not counting on that in the projection we’re doing of where we see the market going the balance of the year. Obviously if gas prices do stay in the above-$4 level, I think that only adds to the potential optimism that we have about 2013 and 2014.
David Anderson - JPMorgan : That number could really change in the second half of the year if it stays here and if your customers start coming back. We should see even more [upset] to your margins.
David Lesar : Yes, that would be our feeling, for sure.
David Anderson - JPMorgan : We often hear your competitors complain about your pricing. It also seems a bit like sour grapes considering you guys have a lower cost structure out there. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense as to how much lower you think your costs are compared to your competitors? And also, how far along are you in the Battle Red initiative and some of these other cost initiatives?
David Lesar : We’re not going to comment from a competitive standpoint on where we think we are relative to cost. I think we’re making progress on the two initiatives you describe, Frac of the Future and Battle Red. We’ll plan to give you a better update on that next quarter. But they do drive efficiency for us in the ability to obviously manage our bus. As I said in my prepared comments, I don’t plan to comment on the tit for tat, back and forth around pricing, just because it’s anecdotal. Our commitment is to make a return on the equipment we put in the market and that’s my commitment. And so that’s what we’re doing.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now open. 
Brad Handler - Jefferies: I guess I’ll stay with North America too to start. And this is a bit of a leading question. If you are as committed as you are, and you have a process where the Q10 pump is rolling out, in principal you cannot retire the older pumps as aggressively and build into an opportunity to work with these good customers of yours that might be growing their bus. Is there any change in philosophy, I suppose, about the retirement strategy of your existing equipment?
David Lesar : No. I mean, the new technology is more efficient. It also has better maintenance cycles. So it’s the right thing to do. And so what we plan to do is continue with what we had said in terms of capital discipline throughout the year. And at this point in the year, we’re well into the year.
Brad Handler - Jefferies : I appreciate your spending wouldn’t change. I just don’t know if the retirement intentions might have softened perhaps? I guess just to clarify the question.
Jeff Miller : I think the way that I would characterize it, from the earlier question, if gas activity were to take off dramatically on us, and we recognized that we weren’t putting enough, it would be easier to dial up our manufacturing just a little bit to get more Q10s out. We’ve been trying to be very disciplined in how the Q10s are coming out. We’ve talked about reducing capex, staying with it, and generating some additional cash flow this year. That’s an adjustment that we can make if we felt like the forecast could lend itself to basically turn out more units rather than keeping the old stuff out of the field and deferring those efficiency gains that we’re trying to capture.
Brad Handler - Jefferies : If I could ask an unrelated one on Brazil, so the contracts have been signed. Help us a little bit with the ramp, the incremental revenue ramp. Does that take several quarters? Should we see full run rates only in 2014? Or does that happen relatively more quickly?
David Lesar : I would say to look more to 2014 for the full ramp on that. We will feather equipment in as we sort of go through the year. But don’t expect full on, really, until the equipment’s in place and ready to go.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Crandell from Cowen Securities. Your line is now open. 
Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities: Given your somewhat optimistic view on gas drilling for 2014, and given the lead times involved, are you close to the point, or are you almost at the point, where you might consider new equipment building in domestic pressure pumping?
David Lesar : I think that’s one of the huge advantages we have by manufacturing our own pumping equipment, is we don’t have the real extended lead times that our competitors might have with respect to when they order up and can dial up their spend there. So I think we really have the luxury of waiting until probably the second and third quarter of this year to take a look at the market before we have to make a decision as to whether or not we want to ramp up production that could come on stream in 2014. And I think that’s part of the reason that we have the higher returns, is that we have more granularity around our ability to control manufacturing.
Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities : For follow up, my question is on the formation evaluation, both LWD and wireline bus worldwide. If you just exclude Brazil for a second, I know that increasing penetration in this market has been key to your overall goal of improving margins internationally. Can you comment, and maybe even include the deep water Gulf of Mexico? Do you feel in both LWD and wireline you’ve gained share of the market in the past year?
David Lesar : Yeah, I think in the last year we have gained some share. And I think it’s demonstrated by some of the markets where we’re working today. So with our sort of full [FE] suite of services, we’re working in east Africa today and some of the more challenging environments there. We’re seeing, as I mentioned, progress in Angola. We’ve won some important contracts [unintelligible] to work in Asia. So yes, we’re making the progress that I would expect and partly just demonstrating our capability to deliver in these deep water markets.
Kelly Youngblood: I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our final question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. 
Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch:  Dave, I was hoping to get your last thoughts on Halliburton’s exposure to the artificial lift market. You have a clear focus on mature fields. And particularly just in light of GE’s announced acquisition of Lufkin. 
David Lesar : If you look at our portfolio, artificial lift is one that clearly was a hole in the portfolio that we have. We made the acquisition a year ago of Global, and now have an offering in artificial lift. It actually, I think, as we said in either the Q3 or Q4 call last year, has exceeded beyond our wildest imagination in terms of financial performance. And it sort of gives us a window into what the opportunities in that market will be.  So we’re glad to be in the business, albeit in a small way right now, but I think that what we’ve demonstrated over the years is that when we get focused on a market and put the capital to it, that we basically are going to be a player.  Now, [unintelligible] is going to be basically in [ESP]. At this point in time, rod lift and things like that we don’t view as critical to our ability to compete long run in the mature field area. But I think that having the ESP offering is something that rounds out what we have and was an important acquisition for us to build on. 
Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And Mark, what’s the potential for significantly accelerating the share repurchase program, particularly if a significant portion of the Macondo settlement is paid in stock? Does that alter the thinking?
Mark McCollum : Certainly a settlement on Macondo gives us more certainty as to what we could do with our cash going forward. I think everyone recognizes we’ve had a cash placeholder on the balance sheet as it were to hold in anticipation of what the ultimately exposure on Macondo might be.  I think having an earlier resolution of it, if we are successful in settlement discussions, would give us some certainty, then, as to what we could do. We typically need $750 to $800 million of cash to run the business. And beyond that, everything else creates an opportunity. And so I think you hit it right. If something were to happen, that would create a lot of opportunity for us to do some interesting things. 
Operator: Thank you. And at this time, I’d like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks. 
Kelly Youngblood: No, operator, you can go ahead and close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You can now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’d now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Thank you, Sam. Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the fourth quarter results is available on Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Jeff Miller, COO; and Mark McCollum, CFO. Tim Probert, President of Strategy and Corporate Development will also be available today for follow-up calls. I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release announcing the fourth quarter results, which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website. Our third quarter 2012 results included a $48 million charge, which amounts to $30 million after-tax, or $0.03 per diluted share, for an acquisition-related earn-out adjustment. This charge is reflected in both our North America and Latin America Completion and Production segment results. Additionally, in the third quarter, we recorded a $20 million gain, which amounts to $13 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share, related to a patent infringement settlement that is reflected in our corporate and other expense. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items on our financial results. We welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?
David Lesar: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2012. First, I'm proud to say that we delivered industry leading revenue growth in 2012 on the strength of our international business. Our international operations also delivered industry leading profit growth. The result is a record year for our company with revenue totaling $28.5 billion, despite the challenges we experienced in the North America market. To put this in perspective, our business has nearly doubled in size over the last three years, nearly all of it from organic growth. We set new revenue records this year in all of our regions and in both of our divisions. From an operating income perspective, we achieved new records in our Latin America region and in five of our 12 product lines. At the start of each year, I find it's important to reiterate our basic strategy. Our cornerstones remain unchanged. Leadership in global unconventional development expanding our share within the deepwater markets and helping our customers maximize recovery from mature fields. As the industry leader in unconventional development, this year we elevated our service offerings with the start of the rollout of our Frac of the Future initiative. This provides the most efficient and effective hydraulic fracturing delivery system available in the industry today. Globally, 2012 is a watershed year for the expansion of unconventionals. In addition to providing services on several of the first commercial unconventional wells in Australia, in China, we expanded our service footprint in key market such as Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Argentina. Ultimately, we differentiate ourselves by offering a fit-for-purpose completion coupled with superior frac designed that maximizes well productivity and delivers the lowest cost per BOE for our customers. In the deepwater area, we are seeing the payoff of our recent infrastructure investments with key contract wins and market share gains in areas such as Malaysia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya and Brazil. Our value proposition for deep water remains focused at improving reliability and integrity in well construction and completion activities and helping our customers reduce uncertainty. We believe our deep water technology portfolio expanding market position and service quality reputation will benefit us as new build deepwater rigs live in the market. And lastly we continue to build out our capabilities in servicing mature fields. Over the last year, we’ve seen great success in critical investments we’ve made in the areas of specialty chemicals and artificial lift. These investments along with Boots & Coots have allowed us to more than double the size of our matured field business over the last two years. Our focus here is to share our customer’s production and improved recovery rates, and provide the technology to optimize performance over the life of the field. Underpinning these strategies as a continued significant investment in new technology, we’ve more than doubled our technology spend in the last two years. And this year we will be expanding our R&D spend at a rate faster than our revenue growth as we further globalize our R&D footprint and drive solutions in unconventional deepwater and matured fields. Now let me move on to operations. Internationally 2012 played out the way we told you it would. We exited the year with margins in the upper teens and averaged 15% for the full-year. Let’s look at 2013. There we anticipate international customer spend increase in the high single digits, maybe more, maybe less. Whatever it turns out to be, the market share gains we’ve had, we expect our revenue to outpace the increased spending levels. We also anticipate full-year margins should average in the upper teens for 2013. We believe that this above market growth rate will come from volume increases as we ramp up on recent wins in new projects from continued improvement in those markets where we’ve made strategic investments in the past several years, from the introduction of new technology, and some modest pricing increases and cost recovery on selected contracts. Shifting to North America, 2012 was a very challenging year for the industry. Operations we’re impacted by headwinds such as guar costs, pricing pressures and a significant drop in the natural gas rig activity. However I want to be clear before you listen to the rest of the presentation. We believe that the fourth quarter marked the bottom for U.S. land margins, and Jeff and Mark will tell you why we believe this. Let’s look at how we see 2013 for North America. First, due to the significant post Thanksgiving slowdown we experienced, we closed the year with approximately a one month supply of high-priced guar inventory remaining. We will be taking delivery of lower-priced guar this quarter and by the second quarter we expect our guar inventory cost to be at market rates. Although current guar market prices have reduced from the high as we saw in early 2012, guar prices remain above historical levels. This has had a silver lining as it is making our fast growing PermStim fluid system a compelling economic alternative and more importantly puts a sealing on the prices we will need to pay for guar in the future. In the U.S. we believe the rig count will continue to grow from current levels, but will average down slightly for the year compared to 2012. However we are seeing higher well efficiencies due to increased pad drilling, more 24 hour operations, rig fleet upgrades and significant advancements in drilling and completion technologies. In 2012 we saw the average days per horizontal well drilled drop approximately 15% compared to 2011 and we anticipate continued efficiency improvements in the upper single-digits for 2013. We believe that this continued shift toward efficiency boards very well for us in the coming years, as no company has the ability to execute factory type operations like Halliburton. We’re also beginning to see signs of activity improvements in the first quarter as compared to December. The given the pronounced seasonal decline we saw in the fourth quarter it could take longer for activity levels to fully rebound to second or third quarter levels from 2012. For the remainder of the year we expect activity levels to gradually increase, but we are expecting continued pricing pressure as we renew our last tranche of stimulation contracts. Many of our competitors are operating at breakeven or lost positions which should set a floor on stimulation pricing. However, an improvement in pricing will require a meaningful decrease in excess capacity which can happen of course in two ways, either equipment wears out, it is not replaced or increased activity takes up the slack.  We are expecting the industry to add hardly any capacity this year and over time, we should see a drop in excess horsepower due to normal attrition. Increasing oil activity and rising service intensity will also help to a certain extent. However, we believe that without a significant uptick in natural gas drilling, it is difficult to see a path for pressure pumping equipment to reach equilibrium this year. Our view is that the U.S. natural gas drilling will not be a major activity driver in 2013, although the rig count in that area appears to have flattened. The decline in output from existing natural gas wells will likely be offset by additional volumes generated from new gas wells, the restart of shutting wells and associated gas from new oil wells if we see any meaningful uptick in gas activity that likely will not occur until the second half of the year. That being said, we still strongly believe in the long-term fundamentals of the gas business and are not going to abandon that market. We have stayed with those customers in the natural gas basins even as some of our competitors left to chase work in the oil plays. This strategy has deepened our relationship with these customers and positions us well when gas activity rebounds. In the meantime, we may need in these basins as a focus has a negative ongoing impact on our margins, but we believe this is the right decision for the long run. Our growth strategy going forward remains the same. We'll continue to grow our market share in deepwater, in global unconventionals and in mature assets. I'm optimistic about the coming year and our ability to rebuild our North American margins and realized continued revenue and margin growth in our international business. And lastly, we remain laser-focused on capital and margin discipline when it comes to pressure pumping. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to provide an operational update and come back at the end of the call to summarize. Jeff?
Jeff Miller: Thanks Dave and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results. Overall, I'm pleased with our results for the quarter. Revenue of $7.3 billion was up 3% sequentially and represents the highest quarterly revenue in company history with record revenue from all three of our international regions, our Drilling and Evaluation division and eight of our product lines. From an operating income perspective, our Latin America and Middle East/Asia regions delivered record profit in our completion tool product line which holds the number one global market share position also had record operating income. Consolidated operating income of 981 million was flat to the previous quarter and was driven by strong performance from our international regions where we saw revenue and operating income growth of 20% and 39%, respectively, compared to fourth quarter of 2011. Latin America posted an excellent quarter with revenue up 14% sequentially, despite a 2% drop in the rig count and operating income increases of 25% compared to last quarter and increased drilling fluids activity along with higher software sales in Mexico and Colombia led to the growth for the region. Also contributing to the stellar quarter was project management in Mexico followed by higher stimulation and cementing activity in Argentina. An operational highlight this quarter was our tremendous success with various Turbopower turbine drilling tools in deepwater Brazil, drilling a horizontal pre-salt well the turbine tools surpassed customer expectation achieving a record rate of penetration on its first run in the Campos Basin and saving the operator multiple days of rig time. Moving to the Eastern Hemisphere, revenue grew 11% sequentially and operating income increased 35% driven by year-end sales of software, completion tools and other equipment as well as the ongoing service revenue from key contract wins that have now started up. Now compared to the same period last year, operating income has increased by over 50%, which we would believe as a solid proof point that we’re successfully executing on our international strategy. Sequentially, Middle East, Asia revenue and operating income increased 14% and 46% respectively. Production enhancement led the growth with year-end equipment sales, in China, and increased activity in Australia and Saudi Arabia. Also contributing were completion tool sales in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Indonesia and higher software sales in China and Thailand. As we continue to lead in global unconventionals, there are two items to note in Middle East and Asia market. In the fourth quarter we saw our first CleanStream unit, a mechanical ultraviolet alternative to biocides, and part of our CleanSuite environmental system successfully deployed in the Cooper Basin of Australia. And in the Malay Basin we executed the first high-pressure, high-temperature hydraulic fracturing job, utilizing our Sirocco frac fluid. Faster than indicated, up to 10 times improvement in production against offset wells and we’re optimistic that this advancement will lead to further tight gas development in the area. Our mature assets strategy continues to deliver with several key wins this year. In Malaysia we were selected to provide the services to exploit the remaining reserves in the Bayan Field with the potential total value of $1.2 billion. In the Middle East, we provided production monitoring SmartWell capability. It reduced water production by 2/3s and increased recovery factor by fold. Turning to Europe, Africa and CIS. We saw revenue and operating income increased 8% and 23% respectively compared to the prior quarter. The improvement was driven by the seasonally higher year-end completion tool sales in the North Sea and Angola, followed by improved drilling activity in the North Sea and Russia. Higher end of year software sales in Russia and Nigeria also contributed to the improved profitability. In deepwater East Africa we’re awarded a six-year multi-country, multi-product line contract. This is the single largest contract award in East Africa today and is evidence of our deepwater leadership and service quality that we have been delivering in this market. Also in the third quarter we opened the industry leading advanced perforating flow lab. This state of the art facility allows us to simulate a wide range of downhole condition’s to evaluate perforation solutions in a controlled environment enabling us to maximize our customer’s production. And before we move on to North America, I want to be very clear on one of my top priorities as Chief Operating Officer. While I have not met many of you, you can be certain that I am dead focused on capital discipline, especially in the frac equipment area. Capital discipline to me means two things. First that we won't to increase our horsepower capital until we’re achieving a better return on our deployed fleet and second, we will not put stacked equipment back to work until it's at an acceptable contract rate. If we have to stack more equipment to achieve these results we will do so. Now let’s look at North America results for the fourth quarter, where the market played out consistent with our previous commentary. We saw a significant drop-off in activity in the back-half of the quarter as customers exhausted their budgets. Our North America revenue was down 5% compared to the previous quarter, right inline with the sequential 5% drop in the U.S. land rig count. North America operating income was down 22% sequentially driven mainly by reduced activity levels around the holidays. Increased consumption over higher-priced supply of guar and continued pricing pressure in hydraulic frac ring as we renewed contracts. Fourth quarter margins were also negatively impacted by the tactical decisions we made to position our business for higher future profitability. These impacts include the upfront costs associated with our frac and the future initiative, the margin impact of our continued presence in the North America natural gas basins and costs related to the idling of equipment and crews during the quarter. And on our last call we said that we would park equipment in order to help stabilize the transactions priced market and to avoid setting a new low price point for stimulation. We also said that we would be retiring older equipment as we upgrade to our more efficient Q10 pumps. In keeping with these strategies during the quarter, we temporary stacked 10 fleets and retired two older fleets from service. We continue to incur the personnel costs as we retain those crews from the stack fleets. In addition, we expect that the new Q10s deployed into the North America market will be offset by the retirement of older fleets. Now as an update to the Frac of the Future, we are continuing the multiyear rollout of our Q10 pumps. Where they are deployed, we are seeing a marked improvement in terms of well-side efficiencies. As a result of an improved operating cycle and reduced maintenance profile, our Q10 fleets delivered the same capabilities as our traditional fleet with up to 20% fewer trucks on location and with fewer personnel. In the fourth quarter, we also introduced our first spread of dual-fuel Q10s into the field. These units use both diesel and clean-burning natural gas which is more environmentally friendly than traditional pump trucks and as the infrastructure matures, will position us to use the abundant supply of North American natural gas as our power source. In the second quarter of 2012, we introduced PermStim. And after 2,000 successful stages, it has established itself as a premium fluid system. The proprietary chemistry of this fracturing fluid results in improved well performance. As an alternative to guar-based systems, its cost profile will also protect us against escalating war costs in the future. Regarding stimulation pricing, the bulk of our customer contracts have been renewed and we expect the small remainder to be renegotiated in the early part of this year. There is still risk of further pricing declines, but we believe they are mainly behind us as there will be virtually no incremental equipment entering the market in 2013. With respect to our other product lines, we did experience some pricing pressure in specific basins; notably for those services closer to the frac. We believe this issue is primarily related to the significant drop in activity that occurred in the fourth quarter. And as activity levels return, we would expect to see these product lines follow suit and stabilize as well. In the Gulf of Mexico, we had a record quarter in terms of both revenue and operating income. For the year, our Gulf of Mexico operation grew 37% as we gained market share during the recent activity increases. Given the deepwater rig arrivals in 2012 and those scheduled for the back half of 2013, we anticipate this activity improvement will translate into double-digit revenue growth and higher incremental margins. We also believe we will continue to grow our market share as these rigs move to a completion cycle on the new wells and anticipate that 2013 will be another record year for the Gulf. So to summarize North America, we have seen margin pressure in two major categories. First, the transitory ones which include our higher bar exposure, the cost of our high equipment increase, upfront costs associated with Frac of the Future and our ongoing commitment to operate in the gas basins. These costs should take care of themselves as the year progresses. The second category covers market based issues, specifically around natural gas activity and excess pressure pumping capacity which in turn is affecting stimulation pricing. These will balance out as the broader market corrects. Given the market dynamics, 2013 will be a year where we focus on driving cost out of the system. Frac of the Future initiative will help us get there, but in the meantime we've already made headcount reductions in the quarter and we're looking at areas where we can further optimize our cost structure. As a result, you may see an impact from severance in our first quarter results. And now Mark will provide some additional financial commentary. Mark?
Mark McCollum: Thanks Jeff and good morning, everyone. Our corporate and other expense totaled $106 million this quarter and included approximately $35 million for continued investment in our Battle Red completion tools manufacturing and other strategic initiatives. These activities will continue throughout 2013 but the related costs should begin to decline in the second half of the year. We anticipate the impact of these investments will again be approximately $0.03 per share after-tax in the first quarter. In total, we anticipate that corporate expenses will average between $110 million and $115 million per quarter during 2013, including these strategic costs. Our effective tax rate was 34% for the fourth quarter and 32% for the full-year 2012. As mentioned previously, we’re nearing completion of a strategic project to realign our international operations to better position us for improved delivery of our products and services to our international customers, closer alignment to our international suppliers, more efficient use of our field technology and an overall reduction of cost. Some of the indirect outcomes that we expect out of this transformational initiative will be an increase in our international earnings and a wide reduction of our effective tax rate going forward. As a result, we’re currently forecasting the 2013 effective tax rate will be approximately 29% to 30%. During the fourth quarter, we recorded an $80 million tax benefit in discontinued operations, related to the payment of our liability to Petrobras under a guarantee relating to work perform number of years ago on the Barracuda-Caratinga project by KBR. As we move into 2013, we’re anticipating the typical sequential decline in international revenue and margins during the first quarter due to the absence of year-end seasonal activities as well as weather related weakness in the North Sea and Eurasia and this drop-off could be more pronounced compared to previous years due to our strong fourth quarter performance. Compared to the first quarter of 2012, we’re anticipating a mid teen percentage increase in revenues with a modest improvement in margins, which is evidence of our expanding international market share. Beginning in the second quarter, we expect international activity levels to recover from the seasonal impact and margins to steadily improve over the course of the year with full-year international margins averaging in the upper teens. Moving on to North America, we expect U.S. rig count in the first quarter will be somewhat roughly the mirror image of the fourth quarter, but down slightly on average. Our expectation is that the rig count will improve throughout the year as activity resumes, but the full-year average for 2013 will be down in the low single-digits compared to 2012. In this activity environment we anticipate frac pricing will continue to be somewhat soft. However for Halliburton we’ve got a very beneficial tailwind going into 2013 which is our significantly lower guar input cost. We expect the continued activity improvement in the Gulf of Mexico will also positively contribute to margins as well as cost optimization in our North America land operations as a result of our Frac of the Future and Battle Red initiatives. Therefore as Dave mentioned previously, we are optimistic about the coming year on our ability to improve our North American margins beginning as earliest the first quarter. As you know we've been trying to operate within our cash flows, though we've also been trying to achieve higher investment yields on our excess cash. So, during 2012 we started investing in some longer-term fixed income securities that don’t meet the accounting definition of cash equivalents. During the fourth quarter I’m proud to say our cash and investment securities increased by $779 million. For the full-year we also achieved an increase in cash and investment securities, even as we absorbed a record $3.6 billion of capital expenditures, an additional $200 million of acquisitions. We anticipate a continued reduction in working capital as a result of lower guar inventories and coupled with a lower capital spend we expect to see higher free cash flow in 2013, and we are anticipating that our CapEx for 2013 will be approximately $3 billion which is about 16% lower than our 2012 spend level. We currently intend to direct less capital towards the North American market in our Q10 horsepower build we’ll be focused on fleet replacement. The displaced equipment will be retired from the market and the emphasis will be on the rollout of the Q10 pump and other ancillary equipment design to advance our Frac of the Future goals. Finally we’re expecting depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion during 2013. Now, I’ll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing comments.
David J. Lesar: Okay, thanks Mark. Just real quickly, we are very proud of our record setting fourth quarter international results. This has been an ongoing focus of our growth strategy and I think these results bear that out. So for 2013 we expect international margins will average in the upper teens and as we have discussed we have called the bottom on U.S. land margins for the fourth -- as of the fourth quarter. With our lower capital spend and improved working capital, we expect to generate an even higher level of free cash flow in 2013 and we remain very focused on capital discipline. So with that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now opened. Angie, you're line is now opened.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: All right, thanks. First congratulations on the very strong fourth quarter and clearly for the year as well, particularly in the international markets.
David Lesar: Thank you, Angie. I appreciate it. Some folks have been critical of us chasing the international, especially the deepwater market aggressively over the past few years, but as I said then and I'll say now, I think that it's worth it. These are long-term markets, these are long-term contracts that allow for aggressive use of our technology and aggressive up-selling opportunities. So, I think you're starting to see the payoff now and you certainly will see it for the next several years.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: I agree and even better. I would add to that that you've done it on the top line but you've also shown very strong improvements in margins also above the peer groups, so a double bonus.
David Lesar: Yeah, thank you.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: So, to follow-up with that, your guidance for Eastern Hemisphere margins average in the high-teens slightly higher than our estimates which is obviously a positive, but I assume Middle East is a big driver of that. However, you referenced E&P spending in the high single-digits for 2013. Would it seem reasonable to you that growth for revenues in 2013 could be in the low to mid double-digits, and where do you expect to see the greatest strength?
Mark McCollum: Angie, this is Mark. The answer is yes and we do expect to outgrow the market in line with our strategies of outgrowing the overall increase in the deepwater market which we think will be a particular strength in 2013, on the back of our market share gains in Latin America as well as some of the increased activity in unconventionals and Saudi Arabia and Australia. And of course I should also reference the deepwater market in East Africa, those will probably be areas that will be primary growth areas, but we are expecting growth rate in the low single-digits -- I mean low double digits, even though we're probably a bit more pragmatic about what customer spend rates will increase on a year-over-year basis in the international markets.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: Right now, you mentioned low-double digits for revenue growth based on what you see today?
Mark McCollum: Yes.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: Okay. And then as an unrelated follow-up, I know in the past you've mentioned returning capital to shareholders in 2013 is a priority. I guess the question is, is it still a priority for '13 and is there a preference for share buybacks versus a dividend or could both be considered and does the Macondo timing have any influence on this decision?
Mark McCollum: That's a great question, Angie, and the answer is that yes, it's still a priority. We, as you heard through our comments, have been very focused on trying to not only just achieve a positive cash flow result but improving that cash flow result as we go into 2013. We're in the process of finalizing our discussions with the Board and internally about our strategic initiatives for 2013. We'll have that wrapped up in the coming weeks. And in that discussion I think the answer is that everything is on the table, but dividends, share buyback, I mean we certainly are staying tuned to what happens on the Macondo front, but it's not an issue that will preclude us from consideration of some of those options. And so, I guess the best way that I can say is, is stay tuned.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James West of Barclays. Your line is opened.
James West - Barclays Capital: Good morning, gentlemen.
David Lesar: Hi, James.
James West - Barclays Capital: And congrats again on another good quarter. A question on North America as we look at the progression throughout this year. I mean you've got clearly some tailwinds with guar, the Gulf of Mexico, some improving U.S. land rig count. But you’ve talked in the past, about normalized North American margins, you’re much higher than where they’re today. Is that something that’s possible to get too in this type of environment where we’ve, less slowly growing U.S. rig count or is this more likely when we get back to a better environment in ’14?
Mark A. McCollum: This is Mark again. I think James, the answer to that is that probably in the slower growing environment where we continue to see some pressure around pricing in the broad market and a – its going to be difficult sort of close up the excess capacity situation until we see some meaningful increase in the gas rig activity. I think that’s also going to mean that its going to be difficult to get us back to normalized margins, which we still believe are in the mid 20s for Halliburton.
James West - Barclays Capital: Right.
Mark A. McCollum: And so we – as we said, we’re calling the bottom, we see that at least the things that we perceive this tailwinds to our margin situation sort of trump the continued pressure that we will feel in frac pricing and possibly – peripherally in some of the other product service lines that are little bit – they’re closer to the frac than others. But I think that its just – its going to be difficult to drive them up back to those sort of historic normalized levels without a – what we sort of perceive is a normalized rig count environment, which includes a healthy dose of gas activity.
James West - Barclays Capital: Okay. So, but you would suggest though that healthy margin gains is not getting back to that what you see is normalized?
Mark A. McCollum: Yes. That’s right.
James West - Barclays Capital: Okay. And then just one follow-up for me on the fracture side, obviously a few more contracts to rollover, but some of the initial rollovers of your longer term contracts would have happened when pricing was still above where it is today. Do you – can you give us maybe some help on percentage of contracts that maybe or above what you think pricing is in the market today and how many rollover as we go through the year?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, thanks James. This is Jeff. I think the – those contracts tend to roll each year, so we’re working our way through the bulk of those. So, from a competitive standpoint as we look out we’ve probably 8% of our business under contract and so we don’t see a huge step down that will occur sort of resetting the prices from the first quarter that with last year.
Mark A. McCollum: Yeah, I think James, let me add one thing. Obviously, as Jeff said about 80% of our stuff is under contract and yeah we have some of the stuff that while the year ago at this time rolling over now, but if we don’t see a price that’s acceptable to us we may just roll it on a month-to-month basis, there’s nothing that says you are required to roll it from year-to-year and in some cases we won't do it, because we don’t want to get locked into a price we don’t like, so we’ll just go on more a month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter basis.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now opened.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Thank you very much and congratulations on a great quarter. A couple of things, and first of all on the North American margin front; could you help us little bit understand the trajectory here, could you quantify on the margin front like you know what kind of how guar could provide in the first quarter?
Mark A. McCollum: This is Mark, Waqar. I don’t think we want to give specific margin guidance; we’re trying to step away from that for competitive reasons. But, I think we have been fairly transparent that the guar situation or Halliburton impacted us through the end of the third quarter about 600 basis points. In the fourth quarter that went up because we stepped back our usage of PermStim and tried to drive harder on using some of the higher-priced guar, so the marginal impact in Q4 of guar as compared to the pricing of guar back in January of 2012 was about 650 basis points. And then the difference in margins, I would say roughly from there is split about 50-50 on pricing and activity in the fourth quarter, and so, I guess, if that kind of gives you some roadmap as we then step back, we’ll wrap up this quarter using that higher-priced guar average in, lower sort of market based guar pricing into our inventory averages that should take us down. Now, the difference in – I think I’ve also articulated that we sort of triangulate the difference in our guar pricing and our competitors has been in our view about 400 basis points or so through the third quarter, and I think that that maybe another market you kind of see as we start rolling back that’s the big opportunity that we have vis-à-vis our competitors.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Secondly, just on the pressure pumping revenue growth side, obviously November and December were impacted by the holiday season, but when you compare the month of October, how did that compare with the third quarter?
Mark McCollum: I'm sorry, your question is on our just overall activity?
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Activity on the revenues in pressure pumping or C&P in the month of October, how did that compare to the third quarter? Do you see any uptick or do you see continued decline in October versus the prior…?
Mark McCollum: Yeah, the month of October actually was very strong for us. It was a really good month and in fact, early part of November was really strong too. As we looked at the market overall, we saw a fairly modest step down in the rigs, at least our activity through Thanksgiving and then a more dramatic step between Thanksgiving and December 15th. But we sort of triangulate if you look across the overall rig count, most of the rig count drop happened in the last three weeks of December, and kind of bottom fell out and our triangulation about 80 rigs went out of the market in the last three weeks of the month. And our business tended to follow that and we think that that maybe overall for the entire quarter at least our calculations about 170 rigs went out. So it kind of gives you a sense of 50% on the three weeks. Does that help?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now opened.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Good morning, guys and thank you for making me look smarter than I really am.
David Lesar: You're welcome, Jim.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Jeff, a question, whenever a company management talks about a transformational event my ears perk up. You were talking about the strategic reorganization supply chain. Can you wax poetic for me for a few minutes on that and the implications of that?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, thanks Jim. We call it Battle Red, but it's a combination of rolling out our Q10 technology which is more efficient, it runs at a lower cost point and allows us to take people off-location. So that's part of that. It's broader though because we're also doing things in the back office with smartphone technology which has been rolled out through a large degree. It also allows us to take out a lot of back office costs. So, from a transformational standpoint, it's lower -- it's surface efficiency or lower cost per BOE for our clients, but then also internally to make sure that we're taking advantage of really what's possible today from smartphone sort of computational platform.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: And you mentioned this both internationally and domestically?
Jeff Miller: Starting domestically. At some point, it would move internationally.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thank you very much. And my follow-up question, can you guys give us some help on the magnitude of year-end sales for the international market? Just so we can kind of normalize expectations going forward. I know that Baker Hughes, their end of year sales were double last year. Just give us some idea because obviously you did fabulous in the international markets?
David Lesar: We don't typically try to give that much of detailed information on our direct sales, so I apologize. It certainly was a step up from where we had been on a year-over-year basis. It was a little bit higher. But in terms of our expectation, it was kind of in line. We saw more direct sales in our completion and production division than we had seen in prior years, some equipment and things into China and that probably was sort of year-over-year difference that we had. But clearly -- I mean it's going to be a big step down in Q1 I think in line with what everybody else has said, they will have an impact but in terms of our -- as I said on the call, our growth on a year-over-year basis is still going to be about 16% roughly.
Jeff Miller: Jim, that's what Mark said I think in the call, maybe we weren't as clear as we should have been. If you just compare where we think we'll be Q1 2013 to Q1 2012, we'll be up about 16%. So that's in my view sort of normalizes out the product sales and tells you sort of what -- sort of service revenue increase we're looking at year-over-year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now opened.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Dave, thanks for that clarity. I’m a little bit slow, can you just say that one more time that up 16% was at first quarter – the first quarter or second quarter, the second quarter?
David J. Lesar: No. Its first – its first quarter of 2012 to first quarter of 2013.
Mark A. McCollum: And that should be up 16%.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: International, okay. Great.
Mark A. McCollum: International.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Thanks for clarifying that. Now, in terms of the North American market, you guys indicated some pricing pressures, of some other product lines, but those that were more closely related to frac, so can I take that to mean that you’re really not seeing any pricing pressures for any of your drilling related service lines at this juncture and what would be your perspective on expectation for pricing pressures in those product lines going forward?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, this is Jeff. We look ahead – I mean, look through the fourth quarter and we saw mostly activity declines having an impact, which we think right itself to the degree next year. So, from a pricing pressure perspective we’re not seeing that now. As we look out into next year, we don’t see that, we don’t see the over supply necessarily the same way as we’ve seen in frac, so we’re not seeing it.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then my final one here is just, in the rack you guys indicated the matching new product checked, its been a drag on international margins so on and so forth. I was wondering if you could give us some rough guidelines as to what that impact had been and are you guys still on schedule to – for that project to roll-off, I think with sometime here in the second quarter, right?
David J. Lesar: Yes. In the second quarter of 2013 the project should come to an end. Over the last quarter we had much better rig performance, things have been looking up, the performance in our rack overall was significantly better in Q4 and basically a breakeven. So, we feel good about how things are shaping up. We got some new contract work going into 2013 in that market and scale helps from an absorption standpoint, so we’re continuing to press forward and hopefully once this [launch] – new project behind us, which at this point as long as we’re executing it shouldn’t be an issue. What we’re really trying to do is to move beyond and put ourselves in a firmly profitable standpoint which we believe will happen during 2013, sort of toward the middle of the year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Dahlman Rose. Your line is now opened.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Co.: Thank you, and let me add to the previous comments. Great job Dave in the quarter and for the year as a whole.
David J. Lesar: Thanks.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Co.: My question has to do with – with Russia and you highlighted a contract with BP-TNK in the quarter; could you one, give us some ideas to the significance of that contract win and then secondly, your market position in Russia let’s just say well below your normal market share especially given this and I would imagine that that’s – that this is a real area of emphasis for you because of the size of the Russian market given it's the second largest market in the world. Can you talk about your strategy in Russia and whether you think you can get up to your desired market position through internal development or do you think acquisitions of maybe existing Russian companies have to play a part in that?
David J. Lesar: Yeah, thanks Jim. The contract we referred to is Em-Yoga which is our mature field type activity if we’re able to go in and prove really the breadth of our technology, so in fact rediscovering reservoirs and then adding to those, so we are excited about that, it's the leading edge of what we think could be more to come. So, I won't give you numbers in terms of significance but it's, I think consistent with our strategy to use our consulting capability, to not just pull through our services, but actually develop new thoughts and new applications of existing technology as well, more broadly with respect to Russia, it's a place where we are excited about the outlook. We think we’ve got the right team on the ground. We think we’re – have the right technology as that market moves more into what I’d say is our sweet spot around multistage fracturing and some other types of mature field activity. We would expect that to grow with respect to M&A. I mean, we always consider those things but I don't think it's a requirement.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Co.: Are you saying that you think you can get up to what's a normal or are you saying you can get up to what you would consider to be an acceptable or normal market share position just by internal growth. I mean you’re like one-fourth the size of (indiscernible), maybe half the size of Weatherford in Russia?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, Jim, let me handle this. Yeah, there's no doubt that our market share in Russia is not consistent with the market share that we would like or we experience in other parts of the world, but my view is we got to be smart about this. And there are certainly organic growth opportunities to grow in Russia and we are growing our business there. But for us to get up to the size of some of our competitors, we would have to look at some major M&A. And as you know, we've talked about this many times with you and sort of with a broader group, we are focused on returns and focused on capital discipline. So, my view is that the need to be larger in Russia does not trump the need to continue to be focused on capital discipline. So, I'm not going to go out and do a major M&A deal in Russia just to get a revenue base that's the same size as our competitors, but really never generates the kind of returns that we want to see off of that. So, I would say that the book is still open on it, but we don't feel any particular corporate need to go out and get a lot bigger in Russia because we're not going to do it and sacrifice margins and returns.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jud Bailey of ISI Group. Your line is now opened.
Jud Bailey - ISI Group: Thanks. Good morning. And again, congratulations on good results. I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail on Brazil as you guys kind of get ramped up down there with some of your recent gains and just help us think about how we think about revenues growing as the drilling contract kicks in and maybe margins and startup costs there that you may incur?
Mark McCollum: The interesting thing is there's still some of the contracts that have not been completely approved or signed. And so we've been in a transitional period for a number of months on things like drilling that's actually allowed us to -- we've been mobilizing but that actually allowed us to kind of spread the cost sum to take off some of the brunt that what otherwise might appear more difficult in terms of a margin environment. But from an activity standpoint, the activity is beginning to pick up. Brazil grew very dramatically for us in 2012. We expect that to continue to grow. We'll be putting the infrastructure capital to work in that area. We have a new technology center that has continued to expand and working with some very specific projects with Petrobras down there we're pretty excited about and those are going to begin to show themselves. So, I guess from our standpoint, we feel very, very good about what Brazil will do in 2013. This sort of the challenge is on. We also feel great about Mexico, some pretty exciting things happening in Mexico. In the Latin American environment, we've kind of got a horse race going on in that market as to who's going to sort of get the revenue poll and growth crown there. I think you should stay tuned for a very good 2013 coming on Latin America again just like 2012.
Jud Bailey - ISI Group: All right. So just to make sure I'm clear. So it sounds like in terms of Brazil any way, you've already incurred some of the start-up costs and mobilization costs, but haven't really felt the impact of the revenue yet and that will probably come in, in 1Q, 2Q. Is that fair to say?
Mark McCollum: I think that's fair to say, yes.
Jud Bailey - ISI Group: Okay.
Mark McCollum: But again, as we look at it and plan and kind of in our margin forecast, the great thing that's happened as a result of the expansion of our share there is while yeah, there's some pricing impacts of that new revenue, the higher level of activity is allowing absorption of fixed cost base that's sort of blunting the impact of that lower price. And so on a marginal basis, our margins in Brazil have continued to improve over this point of time even though some of the contracts have already kicked in at lower pricing.
Jud Bailey - ISI Group: Okay, that's good color. Thank you. And if I could, just my follow-up would just be one more on North America. You guys have done a pretty good job of kind of articulating how you see that market evolving over the course of the year. I'm just curious – I know the month isn't over yet, but I'm just curious how has activity or customer enquiries been so far in January maybe relative to your expectations 60 days ago?
Jeff Miller: Yeah, we’re seeing it, not the way we thought it would roll out last quarter which is, we saw the – seasonal declines kind of between Thanksgiving and New Year’s and then, but then I’ve seen as customer budgets were exhausted and towards the end of the year we’re seeing the mild – the uptick that we were expecting to see kind of end of January as kind of our key customers get back to work.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now opened.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Thanks, good morning guys.
David J. Lesar: Hi, how are you doing?
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Good, thanks. Maybe, I guess, to the degree that you feel that you can’t speak about it, maybe you can give us an update on the MDL process here in front of the trial start data in late February. Any comments you can make on potential negotiations with the class action group et cetera.
David J. Lesar: I think that probably the easiest thing to say, the trial is still scheduled to start in late February, we’re moving forward hard towards that process, the lawyers have been sort of furiously working through all of the discovery actions in preparation for the trial. That is our course at this point. I know there’s been some other activities with the other participants in the trial but at this data I’d say nothing, there’s been no discussions on our side or our path and so our general view is we’re moving to litigation and that’s what our preparations are set to do.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Okay, got it. That’s helpful. Maybe just an unrelated follow-up, maybe helps to [cheers] up even though it's at some level I appreciate that this can be a bit misleading, but the last couple of years have been marked to maybe more so the I guess the ’11 and ’12 but they’ve been marked by some very sizable tenders, particularly in the offshore environments and that’s a lot of due to grab very significant market share as you guys have discussed. Are there as ’13 emerges, are there -- sort of how many significant kind of tender’s are you looking at? Should we expect to see that that’s another chance to seize more market share or have some degree of those large tenders sort of – do they wind down now?
Jeff Miller: Now without being specific with respect to tenders, our backlog as we look out into the next year or so it’s probably bigger than it’s ever been in terms of opportunities [set] so, those tend to be out there quite often and yes some big ones occurred last year, but we’re pretty confident that there will be opportunities to win. I was saying that it's always very competitive in those large tender situations, and so if we go out at those carefully with always a solid plan on how we make the returns that we want to make, just look back to last year kind of putting the eastern hemisphere numbers together as evidence of that.
David J. Lesar: Now I would, let me just add a little color to it. I think as, Jeff has said the opportunities at our pipeline as we call it is probably as big as it's ever been, but what's not there either big, mega, must win kinds of tenders it's just – it's a lot of small to medium sized tenders that are out there and that add up to the biggest pipeline that we’ve ever seen. So, we think that’s a good thing, because with the infrastructure we put down and some of the track record we still have developed off of some of these prior tenders, I think that it's put us on the map in some of the customers eyes of looking at us as a real alternative on some of these which again is why we’re so excited about what we see going forward in the international and especially the offshore and deepwater markets.
Kelly Youngblood: And with that I think we’ve went past our time. So I wanted to, on behalf of the Halliburton management team, thank you for your participation today and Sam you can go ahead and close the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days. The press release announcing the third quarter results is also available on Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development. Jeff Miller, our new COO, will not be a speaker today, but will be a key participant on future calls and investor events going forward. I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release announcing the third quarter results, which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website. During the quarter, we recorded a $48 million charge, which amounts to $30 million after tax, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to an earnout adjustment due to significantly better-than-expected performance of our Global Oilfield Services' Artificial Lift acquisition. These charges are reflected in our North America and Latin America Completion and Production segment results. Additionally, we recorded a $20 million gain, which amounts to $13 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share, related to a recent patent infringement settlement that is reflected in our Corporate and Other expense. As a reminder, our third quarter 2011 results included an asset impairment charge of $25 million, or $19 million after tax, in our Europe/Africa/CIS region. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items on our financial results. Also, for better comparability when discussing year-over-year rig activity, we will be excluding Iraq as certain historical data is not available. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Now I'll turn the call over to Dave.
David J. Lesar: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin with a summary of our overall results for the quarter. Total revenue of $7.1 billion was down 2% sequentially, driven by a 5% reduction in our North America revenues. Our international revenue was up 2% this quarter compared to a 2% rig count decline as a result of solid sequential growth in our Latin America, Middle East and Asia regions, where both had revenue records. Our Drilling and Evaluation division also posted record revenue in the quarter. From a product service line perspective, we had record revenues this quarter for Boots & Coots, Wireline and Perforating, Consulting and Project Management and Baroid, which also had a record quarter from operating income. Operating income of $982 million decreased 18% sequentially, primarily due to pricing pressures and guar costs in our North America Production Enhancement business. International operating income was up 5%, and we are very pleased with the continued strengthening of our market position in key international geographies and product lines where we envision continued growth in the coming years. We believe our strategy is playing out as planned as evidenced by solid activity improvements this quarter in key geographies, such as Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Malaysia and Australia. We continue to be very optimistic about our Latin America business, where we posted another excellent quarter. Revenue was up 8% sequentially despite a 5% drop in the rig count. Operating income increased 12% sequentially, led by solid performance in Mexico and Brazil. We saw a significant ramp-up in unconventional activity across all of Latin America during the quarter as we won new work with IOCs and independents in Brazil, Colombia and Argentina, where we recently completed the country's first microseismic analysis. In Mexico, we continue to introduce new unconventional completions techniques for horizontal wells. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect margins for Latin America to continue to expand, aided by the end-of-year software sales. Our Eastern Hemisphere revenues grew 19% and operating income almost 70% compared to the third quarter of last year relative to a rig count growth of only 5%. We continue to see steady margin improvement and are optimistic about activity levels expanding in the fourth quarter and into the coming year. Overall, for the Eastern Hemisphere margins, we expect to exit the year with margins in the mid to upper teens and anticipate continued year-over-year margin improvement as we go into 2013. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue and operating income increased 3% and 9%, respectively, compared to the second quarter. The improvement was driven by strong activity this quarter in Malaysia and Australia, along with improved results in Iraq. During the quarter, Halliburton provided integrated drilling and completion services for horizontal shale gas wells in both China and Australia. And in Saudi Arabia, we deployed the Stim Star Arabian Gulf, Halliburton's latest stimulation vessel providing state-of-the-art services for the Saudi market. Europe/Africa/CIS had a slight decline in revenue and operating income compared to the previous quarter. Increased profitability in Russia and Libya was more than offset by activity delays resulting from election time shutdowns in Angola, strikes in Norway and reduced activity across continental Europe. Compared to the third quarter of last year, we achieved double-digit revenue growth in this region, and operating income grew 66% as we addressed underperforming markets. We are optimistic about the continued improvement in this region as we are currently pursuing price increases on a number of our contracts. And our deepwater growth strategy remains on track. In the third quarter, we successfully executed our first complete well testing and subsea job in West Africa and expanded operations in East Africa with the addition of drilling fluid services on an exploration well for a large independent, offshore Kenya. Overall, our outlook for the international markets has not changed. We continue to be faced with a series of macroeconomic headwinds: the European debt crisis, lower GDP expectations in China and Brazil and renewed tensions in the Middle East. Despite these factors, there is a tightness in global oil supply today and natural gas is expected to be the single, largest component of future energy demand growth. As a result, we remain very optimistic about the outlook for international services activity and our ability to outperform in that market. As I stated earlier, we expect that fourth quarter margins will exit in the mid to upper teens, and 2013 will improve upon that year-over-year. Going forward, we believe margin expansion internationally will come from 4 key areas: volume increases as we ramp up on our recent wins and new projects, continued improvement in those markets where we have made strategic investments, the introduction of new technology and increased pricing and cost recovery on certain contracts. Now let's turn to North America. Our North America revenues were down 5% compared to the prior quarter as a result of the lower U.S. land rig count, contract renewals that result in lower stimulation pricing and activity disruptions associated with Hurricane Isaac. U.S. land rig count declined sequentially by 68 rigs, or approximately 4%, as operators continued to decrease their gas-directed activity. The oil-directed rig count was up 44, or 3%, this quarter as customers continued to shift their budgets toward basins with better economics. However, this increase was insufficient to offset the 18% reduction in gas rig count. In Canada, the rebound in rig activity from the spring breakup was significantly less than industry expectations. Compared to third quarter 2011 levels, Canada's rig count was down 116, or 26%, and we expect activity levels to remain subdued into the fourth quarter. Across the North American market, we have seen customers curtail spending compared to the first half of the year and believe they will continue to decrease activities to operate within their capital budgets for the remainder of 2012. Couple this with expectations that our customers will take significantly more holiday downtime than prior years, this could have an even more-than-normal negative impact on the rig count as we approach year end. Our North American operating income was down 30% sequentially, driven by guar cost inflations and pricing pressures in hydraulic fracturing. As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to work through our higher-priced guar inventory, and we expect our guar costs in the fourth quarter to be similar to this quarter, but we have made no additional purchases of guar. Moving into next year, we expect reduction in guar costs as we take deliveries of new lower-cost inventory, which we believe will translate into a tailwind to our PE margins in 2013. We've also seen increased pricing pressures in the oil and liquids markets as we renew existing stimulation contracts and win new work. The continued migration of hydraulic horsepower into the oil basins has resulted in these areas being in especially crowded place for stimulation equipment today, with the natural outcome being overcapacity and pricing pressure. We expect this pricing pressure to persist through early 2013 as we renew our existing contracts. But in response to giving fracturing price concessions, we have negotiated pull-through of additional product lines. Several smaller stimulation companies have recently reported losses or breakeven levels of profitability. This has historically been a good indicator that the market is close to or at the bottom of spot pricing deterioration. We remain focused on maintaining our leadership position in North America. Our stimulation fleet remains highly utilized today as we negotiate fracture contract renewals, and we've been able to increase our percentage of 24-hour crews. Many of our competitors simply do not have the infrastructure in place to meaningfully grow their 24-hour operations. This provides us with a unique opportunity to maintain superior asset utilization. And despite the 4% sequential decline in U.S. rig count, North American D&E revenue held relatively flat sequentially, while our operating income grew 5%. Going forward, the successful company will be the one who could help lower our customers cost per BOE for drilling and completing unconventional wells. This is going to require 3 capabilities: an efficient pumping fleet, which we clearly have, especially as we expand our Frac of the Future footprint; 2, better well engineering and fracture design to drill more efficient wells, to only fracture the most productive zones; and 3, fluid systems that maximize reservoir response. To address the second item, we have recently released the industry's most advanced software model called Knoesis. To address the third item, we have developed PermStim. I believe that both of these technologies will be game changers and differentiate us from those companies that have only pumping capability. Tim will discuss them more in a few minutes. Turning to the Gulf of Mexico. Although there was some impact from Hurricane Isaac, the timing of certain projects was the primary driver of profitability this quarter. We are optimistic about the work that we have secured for new deepwater rigs arriving in the Gulf and expect that this will translate into higher market share relative to our historical levels. We're also optimistic about anticipated fourth quarter activity and believe we are well positioned to continue with strong growth in the Gulf in 2013. So to summarize North America, we expect the next couple of quarters to be pretty bumpy. While we have an understanding of the price impact of our contract renewals, there remains significant uncertainty around customer activity levels throughout the fourth quarter, both in terms of rig programs and extended holiday downtime. Activity may be further impacted by the muted recovery in Canada by typical weather-related delays and by customers' decisions to drill but not complete wells. At this point, we believe the downside pressure to the fourth quarter outweigh in the upside, and we will take the necessary steps to adjust our operations. Now we've been running our people and equipment flat-out for the past several years. So if this short-term drop in activity happens, we will not chase the lower price transactional work to keep our crews busy or to gain market share. This is something we traditionally would have done. We will instead stack our equipment and reduce labor costs by working with our employees to minimize the temporary impact of these disruptions. The reason we are taking a different approach this time is because we believe these issues are transitory and we do not want to take the risk of lowering the pricing baseline for a problem that we will expect to go away in a couple of quarters, or to have our customers believe that such pricing would be the new normal going forward. I'm confident that our North America management team is up to this challenge. We're forecasting modest rig growth in oil for 2013, assuming that commodity prices continue to support that. However, to return to the utilization levels we saw in 2010 and 2011, the industry will require some degree of recovery in the natural gas market. We continue to be very confident in the long-term fundamentals of our business and our growth strategy growing forward. We will continue to focus on maintaining our leadership position in North America, continuing to strengthen our international margins and grow our market share in deepwater and in global unconventionals and underserved international markets. Now let me turn it over to Mark for a few minutes.
Mark A. McCollum: Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Our revenue in the third quarter was $7.1 billion, down 2% sequentially from the second quarter. Total operating income for the third quarter was $982 million, down 18% sequentially, after normalizing for the acquisition-related charge and litigation settlement gain this quarter. North America revenue and operating income decreased 5% and 30%, respectively, compared to the previous quarter with margins coming in slightly above 15%. As Dave mentioned, the lower U.S. land rig count, hydraulic fracturing pricing pressure and guar cost inflation were the most significant drivers, combined with lower customer activity and the impact of Hurricane Isaac. Canada had sequential improvement but the rebound from spring breakup was significantly less than we've seen historically. In North America, we typically expect to see a drop in activity in margins due to holiday downtime and winter seasonality as we move from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. This year, we're anticipating this sequential decline will be exacerbated by widespread activity reductions across the U.S. land market as a number of our customers work to maintain spending levels within their 2012 budgets. These activity reductions, along with the additional pricing pressure related to contract renewals, will most likely result in lower revenues and incrementally lower margins in the fourth quarter. For international, we expect the usual sequential improvement in the fourth quarter, driven by landmark software sales, increased completion tool deliveries and end-of-year equipment sales. Typically, international revenues have increased on a percentage basis by low single digits from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, carrying higher margins as a result of these year-end activities. Similarly, we would then expect to see a sequential decline in international revenues and margins in the first quarter of 2013 as these activities subside, coupled with weather-related seasonality. Now looking at our third quarter results sequentially by division. Completion and Production revenue and operating income decreased 4% and 30%, respectively. North America stimulation pricing pressure and guar cost issues drove the lower profitability but were partially offset by stronger results in our Middle East/Asia region. On a geographic basis, Completion and Production North America revenue and operating income were down sequentially by 6% and 39%, respectively, as increased activity in Canada was offset by the transitory U.S. land headwinds already discussed. The Gulf of Mexico was also down sequentially due to the timing of completion tool sales and certain projects, as well as the impact of Hurricane Isaac. However, we're optimistic about higher activity in margins in the Gulf in the fourth quarter and going into next year. In Latin America, Completion and Production posted a 10% sequential increase in revenue due to improved activity across most product lines in Mexico and higher completion tool sales in Brazil. Operating income, however, decreased due to lower overall profitability in Argentina and Venezuela and reduced cementing activity in Brazil and Colombia. In Europe/Africa/CIS, Completion and Production revenue decreased by 5% and operating income decreased by 7%. Higher activity in Russia and increased Boots & Coots activity in the North Sea were offset by depressed North Sea activity in completion tools, cementing and lower stimulation vessel activity. Additionally, activity declines in Angola across most product lines contributed to the sequential decline. In Middle East/Asia, Completion and Production revenue and operating income increased by 4% and 8%, respectively. The growth was driven primarily by strong stimulation activity in Australia, strong completion tool sales in Malaysia, growth in all product lines in China and increased cementing activity in India. Partially offsetting this growth were declines in completion tool sales in Indonesia and Brunei and lower Boots & Coots activity in Saudi Arabia. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income increased 2% and 9%, respectively, led by higher software and consulting services in Latin America and increased activity in the Middle East/Asia region, where we had strong sequential growth in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia and improved profitability in Iraq. In North America, Drilling and Evaluation revenue remained relatively flat while operating income increased 5%, primarily due to higher drilling activity in Canada and improved Wireline and Perforating profitability in U.S. land. Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income increased 7% and 26%, respectively, due to improved activity in Mexico and increased software sales across the region. Additionally, Brazil had higher wireline and testing activity contributing to this growth. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced profitability in Columbia and lower testing and subsea activity in Mexico. In the Europe/Africa/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income both came in basically flat with the previous quarter. Improved drilling fluids activity in Norway and Russia, increased Wireline profitability in Libya and higher activity and software sales in Angola were offset by lower directional drilling activity in Nigeria and the Caspian, along with reduced wireline activity across continental Europe. And finally, Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East/Asia revenue and operating income increased by 2% and 10%, respectively. Malaysia had strong results during the quarter in our directional drilling, wireline and perforating and testing and subsea product lines. Also contributing to the growth this quarter was increased wireline and perforating and directional drilling activity in Saudi Arabia and China, along with better performance in Iraq. Partially offsetting this growth was lower testing and subsea sales in China. Our Corporate and Other expense was $87 million this quarter, excluding the patent litigation settlement gain and includes cost for our continued investment in various strategic initiatives. The expenses related to these initiatives during the quarter totaled approximately $32 billion, slightly more than Q2 but less than we were expecting for the third quarter. We anticipate the quarterly impact for these investments will increase in the fourth quarter to approximately $0.03 per share after tax. And in total, and combined with those initiative costs, we anticipate that corporate expenses will range between $100 million and $105 million during the fourth quarter of 2012. Our effective tax rate, including the nonrecurring adjustments mentioned earlier, was 30.5% for the third quarter, which is significantly less than previously anticipated. And we currently expect the full year 2012 effective tax rate will be approximately 32%, which is, again, lower than past guidance. As mentioned last quarter, one of the key strategic initiatives that we've been focused on is a realignment of our international operations to better position us for improved delivery of our products and services to our international customers, closer alignment to our international supply base, more efficient use of our technology and an overall reduction in cost. Going forward, we expect to see an increase in our international earnings and a related reduction of our effective tax rate in future years. Specifically looking ahead to 2013, we expect to see a 200 to 300 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate as compared to the current full year 2012 rate. We now anticipate that our capital expenditures for the full year will be approximately $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. We'll be presenting our 2013 capital expenditure plan to our Board of Directors at the end of the year and will provide formal guidance on next year's capital plan during our fourth quarter call. However, our current expectation is that our overall capital budget will be lower in 2013 than 2012. We currently intend to direct less capital toward the North America pressure pumping market. Our North American horsepower build will be aimed toward fleet replacement. The displaced equipment will be retired from the market, and the emphasis will be on the rollout of the Q10 pump and other ancillary equipment designed to advance our Frac of the Future goals. Now I'll turn it over to Tim.
Timothy J. Probert: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide a bit more color on Dave's comments regarding factors impacting our return to prior activity levels and normalized margins in North America. First the impact of guar. As discussed previously, the rising cost of guar resulted in a headwind of approximately 600 basis points in our North America business in the third quarter. The current crop is anticipated to be 25% to 50% larger than last year, and we foresee a significant improvement in guar costs in 2013 and a restorative tailwind to margins, notwithstanding the fourth quarter activity challenges Dave described earlier. We've seen rapid adoption of PermStim, one of the game-changing technologies Dave mentioned, which is our high-performance guar replacement. PermStim not only provides an economic alternative to guar, but also provides a vastly improved post-frac cleanup, enabling better flow rates and production when compared with guar systems. On the same Williston pad, for example, production was 20% higher, 150 days post frac, compared with a similar well frac with a guar-based fluid system. In terms of economics, PermStim is highly competitive with guar at current prices, and we believe will offer us a compelling alternative in the event of future guar cost escalation. The second key factor is customer spending. Our customers have reined in their spending in the back half of the year, resulting in a decline of 172 rigs since the beginning of the year. Spending reductions have been more concentrated in large-cap public companies since the end of the second quarter. And as Dave discussed, this group of customers are indicating to us a return to historical levels of activity in the first quarter as 2013 budgets get underway. Thirdly, a more favorable balance in the terms of horsepower supply and demand. Some industry horsepower has been parked, and indications are that horsepower additions have slowed dramatically. We retired 2 fleets in the second quarter and a third this quarter and anticipate further fleet retirements in the fourth quarter. As Mark mentioned, any incremental horsepower builds will be directed towards fleet replacement and focus on our Q10 pumps, which are designed to more efficiently handle continuous pumping operations associated with horizontal activity. Q10s have demonstrated an ability to pump twice as many stages as existing pumps before requiring regular maintenance on a spread that requires 25% less horsepower on location. They're a core component for us of our Frac of the Future. Finally, in a flat-rig count environment, we believe that continued drilling efficiency gains and a rising integration will be key components of improving North America margins. So this suggests to us that excelling at delivering integrated completion services will increasingly become a differentiator in work selection. Earlier this month, at the SPE Annual Conference, we introduced our industry changing family of software called Knoesis. Designed to improve reservoir knowledge and stimulation characteristics, Knoesis is the industry's first comprehensive and ground-up solution to the challenge of modeling fracture behavior in complex, unconventional reservoirs. This enables our customers to add a further layer of science to the fracture completion portfolio. We're now able to design and forward model fracture completions using 3-dimensional propagation methodologies, which provide previously unavailable insight on fracture planes and the extent of reservoir contact. The Knoesis suite gives us unparalleled subsurface visualization and design capabilities. So paired with our industry-leading well-site delivery, we believe we're uniquely positioned to provide improved knowledge of the reservoir and its stimulation characteristics to our customers with the singular goal of making better wells. So while the extent of the North America cycle in 2013 is uncertain, we believe our Frac of the Future initiatives will continue to provide cost benefits and that Knoesis will enable us to materially improve our service intensity, coupled with moderating horseback capacity, reported commodity prices and a guar cost tailwind to our operations, we see these as supportive factors in our goal to return to normalized margins over the course of 2013. Dave?
David J. Lesar: Thank you, Tim. Let me just quickly summarize. We're very proud of our third quarter international results. We continue to gain market share in key markets and expect our Eastern Hemisphere margins to be in the upper teens as we exit the year and are optimistic about continued improvement in 2013. In North America, we will not chase the transnational market as we would typically have done but will instead idle our equipment. And overall, we remain very laser-focused on providing industry-leading returns. So we will reduce capital spending as we go into 2013. But our strategy remains intact. We are focused on maintaining our leadership position in North America, continuing to strengthen international margins and grow our market share in deepwater, unconventionals and underserved international markets. So let's open it up for questions at this point.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies & Company.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: I guess in light of going first, let me try to just make sure I understand some of what you're trying to guide us to. First, maybe a clarification of what you consider to be normalized margins in the U.S. If we're working towards that, how would you think about 2013 evolving? I recognize, of course, in that there are elements to the revenue side you don't see, but let's just -- if you could clarify the normalized margin comment, that would be helpful.
Mark A. McCollum: Well, without giving -- trying to give specific guidance as to when this might happen because that's not what we're doing, we continue to hold that we think normalized margins are in the mid-20s that's -- as we look at the business historically and sort of a balanced market, balanced cost structure, that those mid-20s margins seem to be appropriate to us and that's what we're targeting internally to drive our business forward.
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. It makes sense. And the follow-up in the same vein, maybe it's a bit more fourth quarter focused, you all helped us in saying, okay, traditionally, internationally now, you see a modest, what did you say, low-single-digit revenue increase. I actually thought it might have been higher traditionally and then some margin increase. Are you suggesting that from what you can see, the fourth quarter of '12 would be a traditional year? In other words, is that what you're encouraging us to think about for the fourth quarter in non-North America? Or there are some elements that change that?
Mark A. McCollum: Well, no. I think the way that we're looking at it right now and based on our forecast, we're seeing it as a fairly traditional year maybe with a slight bias to the lower end. I mean, obviously, some of the macro headwinds that Dave discussed have continued to be out there. We're watching them very carefully. There seem to be more headwinds than tailwinds in the broad market itself. But as our business is performing and particularly with regard to the share gains that we've had as some of those contracts come in, we think that those things, coupled together, will allow us to post a revenue gain that's in line with what we have traditionally seen. Does that make sense?
Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division: It does.
Mark A. McCollum: In other words, that the broad market may not be up. But with regard to our revenues, because of our share gains, we think that it will look fairly typical.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund [ph] of Crédit Suisse.
Unknown Analyst: A question. I understand that CapEx being down in 2013 because the current overcapacity in U.S. pressure pumping. But you make comments about unconventional work in China and Australia and, of course, the big deepwater projects that you won and that you're changing. Is CapEx going to continue to be a high number? I mean, are we going to have to continue to invest in this market at the levels close to what we've seen this year? Do we have enough capacity for the international shale boom and the deepwater boom?
Mark A. McCollum: Well, I mean, part of the reason we didn't give specific guidance, Jim, is because it’s something that we're working on. We got to have input from our customers as to what the -- not only the amount, but the timing of their capital spending will be. But -- and I think the other sort of data point to always consider is that we don't build speculative capital. So as we address our capital budget for next year, I mean, I think it is fair to say that there are going to be capital being placed in international markets around unconventionals, around some of the deepwater markets to -- for us to be able to satisfy what our customers are doing on the share wins that we've got and on the projects that we -- they will be doing. We're -- as Dave said, we are focused like lasers on returns right now. We're going to be trying to drive that as carefully as we possibly can. But we do continue to be encouraged about the pace of the development in international and deepwater and unconventionals. The industry as a whole is undercapitalized. I think it's fair to say particularly around unconventionals, we're undercapitalized. And we're going to continue to be working to try to make sure that we have assets on the ground to do that work on a realtime basis.
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And the second follow-up, if I could. The international strategic initiative that you talk about, better delivery of technology, closer to supply bases, can you kind of give us a more layman's term as to what it is you're doing to accomplish this? I mean, what the $32 million this quarter was actually spent on so we can better understand what that is?
Mark A. McCollum: There are several different initiatives, Jim, that we're working on. One is we've been completing a fairly significant manufacturing plant in Singapore for our Completion Tools product service line. Our Completion Tools product service line management now resides in Singapore. We're operating that business internationally. And so that's been a fairly significant change and it also, because of the way that we procure, has required subsistent changes to back that up. Secondarily, we still are continuing to work on a project we internally call Battle Red that is associated with our Frac of the Future initiative but really is designed to look at our back office operations, the ordering cash process, the use of mobility, mobile technologies in the field itself to allow our business development, our operations people to be better connected, to move our paper flows more -- to expedite that flow so that we can build faster, be more responsive to customer changes when their -- when work moves as it always does. And that's a fairly significant rollout that requires some changes to SAP, some reorientation of our business support centers. And that change will probably be sort of come to full fruition in the middle part of next year but something that we're spending some ongoing cost around. We're pretty excited about the opportunities that it will hold to reduce our working capital in terms of day sales outstanding and to allow us to improve our service quality as we work with customers. And then the final step really is around other changes that we see, particularly in our Drilling and Evaluation business orients to be more international. We are taking steps with our legal entity organization and other things to be able to expedite that work. And a lot of that relates to moving IP and other things offshore that allows to better utilize that in some of our foreign jurisdictions.
Operator: Our next question comes from James West of Barclays.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: If I could shift back to North America quickly here. Tim you went into some detail, but I want to make sure I caught everything correctly. In your discussions with your customer base, who admittingly is being very disciplined right now and living within their stated 2012 CapEx budgets, as you talked to them about '13, it sounds like they all plan to get back to where they were kind of starting 2012, which is 175 rigs or so higher. Was that -- am I correct to have assumption? And is that what your customers are kind of implying to you at this point?
Timothy J. Probert: I think a couple of points, James. I think -- number one, I think the rate of drilling efficiency in the second half of the year have probably exceeded expectations. And as a result of that, we've seen essentially this construct of many companies essentially running at a budget as we glide in towards the end of the year. And I think as Dave mentioned as well, the combination of that fact plus it's really easy take a little extra time around holiday period as we've seen in past cycles. That, clearly, is contributing to the slowdown. I think the indications we are getting clearly is that we will see that increase as we get into 2013. I don't think we're naïve enough to think that it happens on -- in the first week of January because it won't. So it will be a spaced event as we go through the first quarter. And that's the best year that we have at the moment.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just a follow-up specifically to pressure pumping, and kind of the pricing dynamics today is market pricing. I understand that you're still rolling over to kind of your new pricing on your contracts, which is still, I believe, at a premium to the market price. Is the market price still going down at this point? Or have we started to stabilize?
Timothy J. Probert: I think that's pretty basin specific. When you sort of break things out a little bit, I mean, if you just kind of look at, say, the Permian, the Eagle Ford and the Bakken together, those 3 basins now represent about 50% of the total rig count in the U.S. And you look at the Marcellus, the Barnett, the Haynesville, they're only about 10% of the total rig count today and down about 50% since the beginning of the year. So you can see where the greatest pressures come from that. It's not to say that any basin is immune right now, but basin by basin, there are different pressures. Dry gas, the rig count declines have stabilized there in fact. Wet gas is still coming down and so if you kind of look at the wet gas, dry gas and liquids, the former are the most impacted. So I think I would say that we're starting to see some signs of a bottom. As Dave mentioned, the best sign that you ever see is when you see people, smaller firms operating at EBITDA breakeven. We've certainly seen some indications of that. That usually is the best indicator that pricing is starting to stabilize. And I think you'll gather more information on that over the coming week or so in terms of whether or not that thesis continues from last quarter to this quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I just wanted to shift from rig count to more to a well count level as you mentioned that rigs are becoming more efficient. So maybe it's probably more useful to be focusing on well count now. As you focus on that, on the horizontal well count, how do you see that progressing in the first half of next year versus the second half of this year?
Timothy J. Probert: When we sort of look at the overall sort of rig contracting picture, I mean, clearly, there are a lot of mechanical and SCR rigs that are getting sort of dropped and put on the sideline. The efficiency gains have been quite substantial during the course of this year, but not just in terms of drilling times but also in terms of move times as well. And that, obviously, contributions to, as you mentioned, the higher well count. We've also seen, I think, an increase in the wells and inventory. Dave touched on that a little bit earlier. So it's a little hard to triangulate exactly what the picture looks like at this moment. But I don't see any change next year in terms of the drive towards drilling efficiency. I think the biggest gains have probably been realized. But we're a very innovative industry and we'll keep pushing for -- to reduce days to debt. So as we get back into next year, I think we'd kind of start where we left off and then we'll continue to see incremental gains that are arguably not quite as significant as we saw this year.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then secondly on service intensity, do you see service intensity still increasing? Or has it now become kind of leveled off or even falling as we look forward in 2013?
Timothy J. Probert: Yes, I think we do see service intensity increasing. As we've said a couple of times, the first battle here has been all around service efficiency. I feel that as a company, we've got that well positioned and as a -- from the example I was giving you regarding our new pumping systems some significant benefits. They are not just in terms of operating cost but in terms of capital deployment, too, which is very important to us. But the next inning really is all about subsurface efficiency. It's about making better wells. And we've been in a scramble as an industry to get work done for a couple of years. Now it's about applying the science to the subsurface, making better wells and becoming a lot more efficient not just in the oily basins, but in the gassy basins too.
Mark A. McCollum: Just a follow-up on that, I mean, I think as we look ahead, we're not trying to build our plan just around service intensity growth and sort of relying on that. As Dave said, we think that the ultimate differentiator is going to be those guys that can be the lowest cost service provider. So we're very, very keenly focused on reducing our footprint, our operating cost, bringing down our internal cost so that ultimately, our realization on a per stage or per well goes up regardless of what happens on the service intensity side.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So to that point, the Frac of the Future, where are you in that the implementation phase? And when do we start to see the benefits of the lower cost?
Timothy J. Probert: We're in the rollout phase today. And obviously, we have a large existing fleet. And so we have to implement enough Frac of the Future fleets to ensure that we sort of impact the overall balance. So we'll start to see some impacts during 2013. The bulk of the impacts though probably will be more felt in 2014.
Mark A. McCollum: We do have some of the Frac of the Future fleets that are out there operating, and the early results are quite dramatic. We've got -- we were very pleased.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan.
David Anderson: So we've been hearing a lot of talk about E&Ps using up their 2012 CapEx budgets and I guess on the one hand, I guess there's a first for everything. But it's pretty unusual, considering these guys are cash flow driven and WTI is above $90. So I'm just wondering. It seems to take a lot of the weaker activity levels. It's really about looking to drive down cost through lower service pricing. Now obviously, in mind, Dave you just made a pretty big change there in your strategies and you're not seeking full utilization anymore. So should I be reading this? Or should we be reading this as basically you guys drawing a line in the sand and saying this is as far as we're going to go on pricing and we're not going to the devalue our services anymore compared to one-dimensional players?
David J. Lesar: I guess that's a great way to summarize it, Dave. As I indicated, one of the lessons we learned coming out of the last dip is that chasing the transactional market essentially sets the lowest common denominator for pricing. And it's that point that you have to then battle uphill on getting prices increases out of. And so our view is that, that is a relatively transitory market for us to chase into given the percentage of 24-hour crews we have. Therefore, we are not going to chase into it this time. We're not going to lower our prices to get that work, therefore, giving us a higher baseline to move forward when some of these other issues get out of the way. So yes, that is a strategy change and one that ultimately, I think, will be successful and it's just a lesson that we learned from the past.
David Anderson: Okay. Now you're talking about transitory weakness in North America and it's going to last only a few quarters. What are some of the signs or at least what are some of the drivers that you're looking for? I mean, are you kind of looking at kind of 3 or 4 things talking about pressure pumping fleet attrition, you talked kind of some of the laying down, but do you need to see industry attrition levels, higher? Is it improvement of national gas rig count? Is it E&P cost coming down? Or is it kind of these emerging basins absorbing capacity? What do you think are kind of the couple of the key drivers? Or at least a couple of the signs that you're going to -- that you're pointing towards?
Mark A. McCollum: David, remember that about 80% to 85% of our fleet is contracted, right? So the key thing that we're looking for is customer budgets, an announcement that they're getting back to work. As we're looking we think about this transitory issue, we're talking about in Q4, they use up their budget and they're basically taking time off to coast into the end of the year. And so the key thing we'll be looking for is when are they are going to be starting backup and when could we get our crews back to work? And that takes up a -- the vast majority of the issue around what we're looking for. The second thing, obviously, will be then watching the rig count overall as it begins to leak up. As you commented, I think it's not the commodity price. The commodity price environment, particularly on the oil side, has been supportive. And we've seen near -- on an absolute basis a 6% reduction in the U.S. land rig count since the end of June in spite of that. And so that's why this feels so transitory and really budget related. And going into next year, many of the contract rollovers, customers have all suggested at least in their initial indicators that they're going to do want -- they're going to do more work, they’ll be running more rigs and asking for more equipment on our side. And so we feel, on a long-term basis, pretty good about what 2013 might hold.
David Anderson: And when do you start having those conversations? Is that kind of a December conversation for January, is that how we think about it?
Mark A. McCollum: Happening now.
David J. Lesar: Still happening right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: A question I would have, you guys indicated here that you're able to maybe offset some of the reduction in frac activity by pulling through other services. That seems like a very familiar refrain from other downturns that typically tend to be transitory. Can you talk a little bit about what kind of product launch you're able to pull through and whether or not that pull-through on a go-forward basis is going to be a substantial factor in helping you get back to that normalized margin? Or is that normalized margin one thing -- I’m coming back to what you said earlier, is that primarily just frac utilization? Can you just give us some color around that?
Timothy J. Probert: Yes, I think the first comment there probably, Kurt, is around pricing in general. I think just to sort of clarify a little bit. I mean, the pricing issues that we have today are primarily around stimulation. So you saw the D&E results. They were good for North America improvement in margins off the Q. And I think as we've touched on, there is clearly -- anything that directly touches frac may have a little more pressure than those things that don't touch frac. So I think the first point is that there is a real opportunity to pull through elements which do not today have significant pricing pressure. I think that's point number one. And with respect to the pull-through, obviously, anytime that you renegotiate, you're looking for some opportunity to improve your longer-term position. You've heard it from us before. It's something that we tend to focus, on and those product lines typically would be around completions, would be around wireline, would be around coil, just to give a few examples of areas where we would really sort of push to, to try and improve the pull through.
Mark A. McCollum: Okay. Let me just add. Kurt, as you're thinking about the normalized margins, as we think about our North America margins or at least our U.S. margins right now, they're not us as far off as I think that the average margin indicates, right? We've described that guar is about 600 basis points of margin impact on us. When you eliminate that, that comes back to us substantially. We're back above 20%. We also think that we probably lost a little under 100 basis points of margin this quarter just on activity and mix as a result of the declining rig count over the course of the quarter. And so it doesn't take that much movement for us to sort of begin to threaten those normalized margins as we've talked about them with some repair on the market.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Great. I was wondering, David, if you can make -- give us an update on how you think things are progressing in Iraq and what you think the outlook is in general for Saudi and Iraq heading out into 2013.
David J. Lesar: I think first with Saudi, I think it's a good news story. We like our position there. We've had additional rigs added to our south guar project. That one is going very, very well, Manitha [ph] the rig count is up on that project. As I indicated, we've just added a stimulation vessel into the market. We have been assigned a geographic area in Saudi to try to demonstrate that we can make unconventionals work there in some of their tight gas area. So that market is very good for us right now and potentially even better as we go into the next couple of years. Iraq is certainly, for us, a lot better than it was last year, where we were struggling with some contracts. We are getting through those at this point in time. And as I indicated and Mark indicated, the financial results are better. It is still a very difficult market to operate in. And the size of projects and the contract structure basically creates a bidding frenzy around them, which means that everybody is bidding those things fairly thinly. But we've got good infrastructure on the ground. We're committed to that marketplace. We just have to work our way through some of the contracts that we did have some issues with. But we're very optimistic about that market also.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Mark, could you just review with us exactly how the mechanics of the guar cost recovery work? I mean, I understand the fact that you guys are turning very some high cost inventory and haven't necessarily been able to pass that through. On a guar cost markdown, with regard to raw material cost input into the job, will the client expect to receive some of that? Or because they didn't get it, they didn't have to pay for it in the first place? You get to keep it? How does that work, I mean, mechanically?
Mark A. McCollum: Yes, essentially, guar is our cost, right. It's an input cost into the work that we do. As our guys have been in the market bidding, we know that we have a higher cost average -- higher average cost of guar. They have substantially tried to ignore that. So that they remain competitive. And as a result of that, to the extent that our inflation is above the market, we've just taken that straight on the chin. And as we look ahead, with the crop yield being 20% to 50% higher next year, we're already beginning to see sort of current pricing of guar in the market beginning to fall, the success of the PermStim rollout and what it's being able to achieve for customers and the demand that we're seeing in terms of its growth, we feel like that will not only be able to kind of get ourselves back to as we normally would on supply chain side, be it sort of the most favored nations price that's out there in the market, but also probably have some ability to value price the PermStim offering going into next year as we get more and better results from its use.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: But on the lower cost guar is like getting contractually to your customers.
Mark A. McCollum: Is that [indiscernible]?
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Yes.
Mark A. McCollum: Let me kind of give you an example. Our stimulation pricing is generally on a per stage basis. Let's say, we charge $100 first day. I mean, it's obviously a lot more than that. But let's say $100 as an example, of which, let's say, $0.50 of that -- there are $50 of that $100 is materials that are consumed and that includes our guar cost today. As Tim said, there's about 600 basis points in that. So what we would expect is our $50 of material to go down to $44 of material or whatever the math would work out. So therefore, the customer doesn't see the increase as they came through and won't see the decline as it goes out.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Okay. That makes sense. And then with regard to, again, timing, we would expect to see the headwind become a tailwind when? Q2 of next year?
Mark A. McCollum: Well, I mean I think our hope is that we're going to be really working through a lot of our inventories, getting it down in normalized levels toward the end of this year or early next. I mean, the variable in this is to what extent activity falters in Q4 because we've sort of known fairly closely what our usage is and where that's going, and then also how much PermStim. PermStim has been growing significantly as a substitute product that can also cost some of the guar inventory leak over into Q1 if we don't use it. But having done that, we think that really, we're going to start new purchases of the new crop year at the end of the year and that will begin to influence the average cost in our inventories quite dramatically. And so hopefully, by the time we get out of Q1, no matter what happens, we'll have this guar issue behind us, back to market levels.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kelly Youngblood. Sir, you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days. The press release announcing the second quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development. I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risk are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release announcing the second quarter results which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website. Please note that our sequential comparisons today will exclude the $300 million charge reported in the first quarter of 2012 for estimated loss contingencies related to the Macondo well incident. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. We ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 related follow-up to allow more time for others who have questions. Dave?
David J. Lesar: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. We certainly had a lot of moving parts in the second quarter, but I was pleased with the overall final outcome. Total revenues of $7.2 billion were a new company record for us. This represented a 5% growth sequentially and was the direct result of all 3 of our international regions achieving record revenues as well as us being able to leverage our #1 market position in North America to outperform the competition once again in terms of total revenue growth. Before we go into the details of the quarter, I would like to remind everyone of our ongoing global strategy: to maintain our market-leading position in the U.S.; gain market share in the international markets; and deliver industry-leading revenue growth and returns. By any measure, whether sequentially, year-to-date or year-on-year, we are successfully executing on this strategy. Now let's look at our performance. From a global product line perspective, we achieved record revenues during the quarter in 8 of our 12 product lines, and in Cementing, Completion Tools, Multi-Chem, Testing and Subsea, we achieved new records in both revenue and operating income. Operating income of $1.2 billion declined 9% sequentially, primarily due to cost issues in our North American production-enhancement business, which we expect to work through by the end of the year as I will discuss shortly. International operating income was up 31% sequentially from activity and pricing improvements in all regions. Let's look first at our North American results for the quarter. Compared to a rig count decline of 17%, our sequential revenues were essentially flat. The Canadian rig count dropped 70% sequentially due to the seasonal spring breakup. The U.S. rig count declined 1%, but our U.S. revenue actually grew 3% sequentially. As you know, we saw a continued shift from natural gas to oil-directed activity during the quarter. The U.S. natural gas rig count declined 18% from the first quarter and is currently down 42% from its high in October of 2011. This represents a low point in the natural gas rig count over the last decade. However, the majority of the drop in gas rigs to date has been offset by an increase in oil and liquids-driven activity as our customers had shifted their budgets toward basins with better economics. Our North American operating income was down 19% sequentially, driven by 4 factors. In descending order of impact, these factors were guar cost inflation, which I'll talk about a few minutes; the Canadian spring breakup; pricing pressures that are isolated to our production-enhancement product line; and efficiency disruptions associated with ongoing equipment locations. The impact of guar cost inflation was dramatic this quarter and we expect it to continue to impact our production-enhancement results throughout the rest of this year. Our U.S. business is a well-functioning machine and we did not want that machine to miss a beat. We are recognized as having a reputation for the best execution reliability in the industry and are the largest 24-hour operation of any supplier in the industry. Since we were unwilling to compromise this reputation, we made a strategic decision that on top of our normal guar purchases, that we would procure a large reserve of guar based on the demand we saw in the market coming out of the first quarter. At that time, rising customer requirements in the oil and gas basins was driving up demand for gel-based systems and the elevated commodity prices at that time supported our ability to push price increases to our customers in order to counter the incremental higher input costs of our guar. For us, the equation was a simple one. Having the frac spread that made a 20% margin using higher-priced guar was better than the one that made no margin because we had no guar to pump. So during the quarter, we were able to meet all of our customer needs and in a number of cases, we were able to catch jobs our competitors could not get to because they lacked the supply of guar. This enabled us to take market share while demonstrating to these customers why they can rely on Halliburton when supply chains get stretched. Today, supply concerns around guar have eased and spot prices have declined, but costs remain high relative to historical levels. Furthermore, the decline in oil and gas prices in the second quarter have made our customers more reluctant to accept price increases to cover our incremental guar costs. Because of the large reserve of extra guar inventory we have on hand, our results will reflect an even higher average cost of sales impact over the remainder of this year as we work through our supply of this higher-than-average cost guar. At this point, there is no shortage of guar, but most of the industry will have to work down their inventories of their higher-priced product. So with 20-20 hindsight, simply put, we made the wrong decision. The result is we bought too much guar too early and paid too much for it. We should not have purchased the extra inventory. The impact was dramatic in the second quarter as we absorbed these higher prices and even more so in the third and fourth quarter as we work off the inventory. I want to be clear with you, I supported and agreed with the decision to secure the strategic guar reserve and I will take the heat for it. Now let me give you some additional data on the impact guar will have in 2012. In the second quarter, about 2/3 of our North America margin compression was due to the impact of escalating guar costs, which rose approximately 75% from the first quarter. As we go into the third quarter, traditionally our busiest quarter in North America, we expect our total guar costs will rise an additional 25% over the second quarter as we work off our high-cost reserve and then costs should reduce as we close the year. Keep in mind that while the market price for guar has dropped and supply is readily available, spot purchases made today could not be delivered to the industry for nearly 2.5 months due to grinding and shipping times. We currently anticipate future guar pricing will decline, but the situation is still volatile. Spot prices for unprocessed guar splits fluctuated more than 30% just last week alone as the market reacted to the monsoon weather outlook. And depending on how the monsoon season plays out, our current excess guar supply may, in fact, become a strategic asset for us in North America if this year's crop falls short. But to help protect us against these issues in the future, we are actively developing alternatives to guar, which Tim will talk about later. Moving on to pricing pressures. We saw some impact to frac pricing in the quarter. While spot frac pricing in the dry natural gas basins was under siege in the second quarter, it now appears to be leveling off, in many cases, because there are so few competitors left in these basins today. We are also seeing increasing pressure in the oil and liquids markets as we negotiate the renewals of existing stimulation contracts and win new market share. In contrast, the majority of our other product lines continue to maintain relatively stable pricing. Now we continue to add new equipment in North America to support our Frac of the Future initiative. This quarter marked the first of our new Q10 fleets being deployed and they are already surpassing expectations in terms of well site performance, efficiency and maintenance. In the event that the market does deteriorate to where we are not earning our cost of capital, we would likely idle or retire older fleets and continue to bring new fleets out and build up our Q10 operations. Most importantly, I believe, for you to note, is that today, our total frac fleet remains fully utilized. Every truck we build is committed to a customer before it comes off the line. And where an existing customer has reduced demand for our services in a particular basin, we have been successful at displacing the competitor on other work for either that same customer or for a new customer we could not get to in the past. Our strategy in this environment has been and will continue to be to take advantage of our market position, differentiated technology, a more complete set of product offerings and the general flight to quality, which appears to be underway. Historically, this has resulted in market share gains during the downturn, which we have positively then leveraged during the ensuing up cycle. We see no reason for it to be different this time, and our second quarter versus our competitors certainly bears that out. The continued migration of equipment from the gas to oil basins also means we continue to incur some lost revenue opportunities and mobilization costs with these moves. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we still expect to see a modest reduction in the gas rig count as operators focus on basins with better economics. We believe that despite recent improvements in natural gas spot prices, downward pressure will continue throughout the injection season. Oil and liquids-rich drilling has mostly offset recent reductions in gas rigs, and the majority of our customer base remains committed to previously stated activity levels. However, we believe that recent volatility in oil and softness in natural gas liquids may prompt certain customers to adopt a more cautious tone toward the timing of their drilling and completion activities. As we look to 2013 for U.S. land, we are optimistic that land activity will continue to strengthen, led by a growth in unconventional developments in oil basins such as the Eagle Ford and the Bakken where we are very well aligned with the long-term asset owners. In addition, we will have worked the higher-priced guar out of our inventory and expect to be replacing it with more normally priced inventories. In this environment, our North American margins can return to their normalized levels. Turning now to the Gulf of Mexico. We continue to see activity recover and our 2Q margins are now at pre-moratorium levels. We are optimistic about the work that we have won in directional drilling, fluids, wireline, completions and other product service lines for the new deepwater rigs arriving in the Gulf over the next few quarters. We expect that this will translate into a higher market share relative to our historical level and also believe that margins will continue to strengthen as our customers adapt to new regulations and industry efficiency improves. Moving on to our international results. We are very pleased with the market share gains that we have made. We continue to outperform our competition in terms of revenue growth and we are now seeing margins begin to climb as we execute our strategy around economies of scale, new market entries and selective price increases, and of course, the introduction of new technology. I think it's important to note that while North America market share can fluctuate more rapidly, the market share that we have captured internationally is longer term in nature as it provides a strong incumbent position for many years to come. This is why we have been so focused on gaining international share. We continue to be very optimistic about our Latin America business where we posted another solid quarter. Revenue was up 13% sequentially compared to a 1% gain in the rig count. In Brazil and, therefore, for Latin America, our margins were impacted as we incurred cost to mobilize for our recent award of the wireline package. We also believe we are well-positioned to win significant incremental work on the recent bids for both directional drilling and testing in Brazil, which should position us well in the future. Additionally, we expect our margins for consulting and software services in Latin America to expand in the second half of the year just as they've done in prior years. Our consistent strategy in the Eastern Hemisphere is playing out positively as well as evidenced by the record revenues achieved this quarter and by our improving margins. Eastern Hemisphere revenue was up 15% sequentially relative to a rig count gain of 5%. If you look back a year, our revenues are up 23% from the second quarter of 2011, on only an 8% increase in rig count. We continue to make progress in markets that had previously been negatively impacting our results and are optimistic about activity levels expanding in the second half of 2012. Europe/Africa/CIS had a strong recovery from the first quarter. The Europe and Eurasia areas, as a whole, are now generating margins higher than our current Eastern Hemisphere average. Libya continues to recover while the investment and restructuring efforts made last year in other parts of Africa continue to pay off. We are particularly pleased with the rapid ramp-up of our East Africa operations where margins are also above our Eastern Hemisphere averages. Across the region, our service quality and technology are being recognized by our customers. In the U.K., our exceptional performance with Sperry geosteering has led to takeaways from a competitor. And based on relative performance against 2 of our large peers, another customer singled out Halliburton for our superior wireline technology. And in Tanzania, our formation evaluation team was recognized by a customer for their performance. And in Russia, we were awarded team of the year by another large IOC customer, recognizing our ongoing commitment to safety and service quality. In the Middle East/Asia, we recovered well from the seasonal weather experienced by Australia in the prior quarter, and China activity rebounded sharply from seasonably low levels in the first quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, operating income across the region is up 59%, highlighted by a 72% improvement in Asia Pac countries. During the quarter, we completed our second multistage frac operation onshore in Australia and are optimistic about this growing unconventional market. Overall, our outlook for the international markets has not changed. We have always believed it would be slow and steady and now that seems to be the consensus among our peers. We believe international activity will continue to grow steadily, which is beginning to translate into longer-term pricing improvement. Near term, we expect that overall margin expansion will result from volume increases as our new projects ramp up, new technologies are introduced and as we continue to improve results in those markets where we have made strategic investments. We are increasingly confident that our 2012 Eastern Hemisphere exit margins will be in the upper teens and that we will average around 15% for the year. We remain optimistic about the long-term global demand picture in commodity prices despite the various economic uncertainties that are weighing on the global hydrocarbon demand picture in the short run. Supply disruptions, including Iranian sanctions and lower-than-anticipated production levels in Iraq, Libya and Brazil, continue to pressure supply levels and the capacity in the global liquids market is still relatively tight. Continued demand growth in non-OECD countries, the declining production in mature fields and rising marginal cost of production all support the long-term fundamentals of our service business. So going forward, we will continue to focus on maintaining our leadership position in North America, strengthen our international margins and growing our market share in deepwater in underserved international markets. Additionally, we believe we are well positioned to capture market share in the expanding international unconventional business by leveraging our technology and expertise that we developed in North America. I believe our revenue growth on a relative basis has proved that strategy out for this quarter. Now let me turn it over to Mark for some more color on the financial results.
Mark A. McCollum: Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Our revenue in the second quarter was $7.2 billion, up 5% sequentially from the first quarter. Total operating income for the second quarter was $1.2 billion, down 9% from the previous quarter after normalizing for the first quarter Macondo-related charge. North America revenue remained flat and operating income decreased 19% compared to the previous quarter. As Dave mentioned, guar cost inflation was the most significant driver, combined with the impact of Canadian breakup, frac pricing pressures and equipment relocation. Excluding Canada, we expect these challenges will contribute to incrementally lower margins for the remainder of the year. We believe the majority of the margin impact will result from working through our higher-cost guar inventory and additional pricing pressure for hydraulic fracturing. Internationally, revenue and operating income increased 15% and 31%, respectively, compared to the previous quarter, driven by the seasonal recovery of our international business, market share gains, and to a lesser extent, improved pricing. Looking at our second quarter results sequentially by division. Completion and Production revenue increased 4% while operating income fell 12%. North America cost issues drove the lower profitability, but were partially offset by stronger results in our international regions. On a geographic basis, Completion and Production revenue in North America was flat sequentially as increased activity in the Gulf of Mexico and U.S. land oil and liquids basins was offset by lower revenues in Canada due to the seasonal breakup. Operating income declined by 21%, primarily due to the cost and pricing issues that are currently impacting our production-enhancement product line. The decline in U.S. land was partially offset by the Gulf of Mexico where operating income more than doubled from the first quarter. In Latin America, Completion and Production posted an 11% sequential increase in revenue due to additional production-enhancement activity in Argentina and Mexico and increased cementing activity in Mexico and Venezuela. Operating income remained relatively flat, however. The increased activity was offset by higher costs for Boots & Coots in Mexico and Cementing in Argentina during the quarter. In Europe/Africa/CIS, Completion and Production revenue increased 21% and operating income increased 67%, primarily related to the rebound of activity following seasonal weather issues in the first quarter. All product lines had improved revenue and the majority had decreased profitability compared to the preceding quarter. The operating income increase was led by improved Completion Tool sales across the region, increased Boots & Coots profitability in Angola and improved Eurasia production-enhancement and cementing activity. In Middle East/Asia, Completion and Production revenue and operating income increased by 16% and 40%, respectively. Australia had increased -- increases across all product lines as activity recovered from seasonal weather issues in the first quarter, and we saw a healthy increase in activity across all product lines in Saudi Arabia. Also contributing to the sequential increase was higher Completion Tools sales in Indonesia, Brunei and the U.A.E. and increases in production-enhancement activity in Malaysia and Qatar. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income increased 8% and 7%, respectively, led by record revenue in our Baroid, Testing and Subsea and Wireline and Perforating product lines. From a geographic perspective, performance was driven by increased Testing and Subsea activity and sales in Mexico and China as well as increased directional drilling activity in Venezuela. In North America, Drilling and Evaluation revenue remained relatively flat while operating income decreased 13% primarily due to lower directional drilling in Wireline and Perforating services in Canada due to the seasonal breakup and the migration of drilling activity from gas to oil and liquids-rich basins in U.S. land. This decrease was partially offset by improved fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income increased 14% and 25%, respectively due to higher Wireline and Perforating activity in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil; additional Testing and Subsea work in Mexico; as well as increased directional drilling activity in Venezuela and Ecuador. In the Europe/Africa/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income increased 9% and 60%, respectively, due to increased directional drilling throughout most of the region, higher demand for fluids in Norway and some wireline direct sales into Poland. Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East/Asia revenue and operating income increased by 17% and 11%, respectively. China led the increase across multiple products -- product lines. We were also -- we also had improved performance in Australia, Brunei, India, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher costs related to our Majnoon project in Iraq. Our Corporate and Other expense was $106 million this quarter and includes cost for our continued investment in various strategic initiatives. The expense related to these initiatives during the quarter totaled approximately $29 million. We anticipate the quarterly impact of these investments will increase slightly in the second half of the year to approximately $0.03 per share after-tax. In total, we anticipate that corporate expenses will range between $105 million and $110 million per quarter for the remainder of 2012. In response to the increased globalization of our business, one of the key strategic initiatives that we've been focused on is a realignment of our international operations to better position us for improved delivery of our products and services to our international customers, closer alignment to our international supply base, more efficient use of our technology and an overall reduction of our costs. Some of the indirect outcomes that we expect out of this transformational initiative will be an increase in our international earnings and the related reduction of our effective tax rate in future years. We expect to complete the first stage of this realignment in the second half of the year. Our effective tax rate was 32% for the second quarter. And including the impact of this realignment initiative, we currently expect the full year 2012 effective tax rate will be approximately 32% to 33%. During the quarter, our cash balance was reduced by approximately $500 million, driven in part by the increase in cost and volume of our guar inventory. Our higher level of revenues also contributed to increased receivables. We currently expect this working capital increase to turn during the back half of the year, and maintaining our cash flow discipline continues to be an important part of our strategy. We anticipate that our capital expenditures for the year will now be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. We're directing more of our CapEx spend toward international projects due to recent and expected contract wins. Based on the strength of the long-term fundamentals of our business, we feel very comfortable maintaining investments at this level. Tim?
Timothy J. Probert: Well, thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. To begin with, I want to follow up on the guar alternative Dave mentioned earlier. We successfully introduced a new product during the quarter in response to the escalating costs and the uncertainty of supply associated with guar. Our newly introduced PermStim fluid system follows in the footsteps of CleanStim, our frac fluid sourced entirely from the food industry. PermStim delivers the proppant carrying capacity of a guar-based gel but with the advantage that it's engineered to provide a residue-free channel when the gel's broken, enhancing the hydrocarbon flow. We pumped well over 500 stages in the Rockies, Mid-Con and South Texas during the quarter and believe we've confirmed its premium performance characteristics relative to native guar-based gels. We are working to ramp up production to establish it as a permanent part of our product lineup, increasing the performance and the reliability of our delivery platform. We're pleased with the execution of our international strategy and the record revenues seen in all 3 international regions this quarter. In Middle East/Asia, we've significantly expanded our offshore and deepwater position with a series of major Pan-Malaysian contract awards and extensions. These contracts are valued at more than $700 million with services across our portfolio, including drilling, wireline, perforating, testing and completions. In Australia, as the unconventional market unfolds there, operators are looking for empirical knowledge and a proven track record to help them develop their assets. Our Pinnacle microseismic and tiltmeter technologies were successfully utilized to characterized unconventional assets for our customers in Queensland and South Australia in the quarter. In Europe/Africa, our deepwater activity in East Africa continues to grow and we're currently providing services on all deepwater rigs there with a leading position in fluid services, cementing, completions and drilling. I should add that our entry into East Africa wireline markets has been successful, too. The position we've established in East Africa deepwater has provided us a platform for recent contract awards for onshore exploration areas in Ethiopia and Uganda. In the Latin America region, we reported last quarter on the delivery of the record-setting PA-1565 well in Mexico's Chicontepec basin, the Remolino lab, which had outstanding performance. We followed this success, completing 6 additional wells all exceeding initial production estimates as well. During the quarter, a zipper frac, a stimulation of 2 separate and parallel unconventional wells was performed with Halliburton's RapidFrac sleeve technology, a first in Latin America and with excellent production results. Now as you know, we are committed to growing our share internationally without sacrificing long-term margins and returns. The latest market report from Spears and Associates indicates our share position grew last year in all major product lines except for pressure pumping. Our Completion Tools product line is a notable success and has just taken the #1 global market share position. This is a culmination of a multiyear effort focused on new technology development and cost and efficiency gains through an aggressive supply chain strategy. This incorporates new roofline in Singapore and Malaysia to serve the needs of our international customers. One highlight of the completion's growth story is our expandable liner hanger system, VersaFlex, which has shown 40%-plus annual growth rates over the last 3 years as it displaces standard systems and becomes our customers' preferred method of delivering liner top pressure integrity. New completions technology is playing a part, too. We've also just deployed our new enhanced single-trip multistage completion system in the Gulf of Mexico. Designed for use in deep and ultra deepwater, the system enables several intervals within a well to be isolated and treated with a high-rate frac pack during a single trip of the workstring. This unique technology saved this deepwater operator 18 days of rig time. Dave?
David J. Lesar: Thanks, Tim. Let me just summarize. I know there -- a lot of people got on the call late today. We're very proud of our second quarter results. We've set new record -- revenue record totals for the company, and in all 3 of our international regions and for 8 of our product lines. North America. We expect our frac margins will be compressed by higher-cost guar and additional pricing pressures. But our other product lines, however, remain stable. Internationally, the story is playing out as expected. We continue to gain share and fully expect our Eastern Hemisphere margins to be in the upper teens in the second half of the year with a full year average in the mid-teens. And finally, we intend to deliver industry-leading revenue growth and returns. So let's open it up for questions now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Is there a way to quantify some of the margin impact in North America for pressure pumping and how we could be in, maybe by the end of the year, where could margins be? Do you see fourth quarter, could the benefit from guar price declines maybe start to offset some of the seasonal declines and pricing pressures?
Mark A. McCollum: Waqar, this is Mark. In the comments, we tried to give you a little bit of color. There's going to be a fairly significant impact for guar inventory costs as we move through the year. As Dave said, about 2/3 of our margin delta in the second quarter is related to guar costs as we look and that inflated about 75% over first quarter levels. We expect guar to inflate another 25% in the third quarter. And so in probably sort of relative terms, that's going to end up being about 2/3 of the impact as we look forward. That should abate as we go into Q4. There will be some pricing impact. We are expecting, as long as there's risk to the gas rig count which we expect will continue to be pressured through the end of the injection season, there will be pressure on hydraulic fracturing margins. But there will be some benefit for Canada getting back to work as well to offset that. So it's difficult to say exactly where that will be. We're not going to give specific margin guidance sort of beyond that, but I think that, that ought to be sufficient to kind of help you find where we are. But all of those things should be relatively transitory. As we go into 2013, we're expecting the rig count to begin to grow again, the guar cost issues to be behind us and normalized based on sort of what ought to be market industry averages. And from there, then we also should start seeing the benefits of our Frac of the Future initiative, all of the things that we've been doing to try to transform the business to reduce our costs, will to continue to provide some uplift to our margins as we go into 2013.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: In the past, you've said that you normalized margins around 25%, 26% for North America. Has anything changed in your view that at some point in 2013, you could not get back to that kind of level?
Mark A. McCollum: No, nothing's changed from that front. We still believe that, sort of that mid-20s range is our normalized area of margins.
Operator: Our next question comes from James West of Barclays.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just to follow up little bit on the North America simulation topic, curious as to when you roll over contracts now, are you still able to achieve pretty significant pricing, I guess, premiums versus your competitors? So if the market's down 20, you're only down, call it 10, just to throw a number out there? And then second, are your customers still asking for the same level of term contracts as they were, say, 3 or 6 months ago?
Timothy J. Probert: So 2 parts to that question, James. I think first of all, obviously, contracts are renewing throughout the year. That's a bit in contrast to the way it was 3 or 4 years ago when we kind of had the big renegotiations at the end of the year. And the answer is, yes, we believe that we're continuing to get a premium as we renew those contracts. That's quite clear. And secondly, in terms of the term, I would say they're getting shorter. Obviously, you're in an environment when there is more uncertainty than it was when the original contracts were undertaken, so it's reasonable to assume that those terms will be shorter than they were previously.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then, Mark, maybe...
Timothy J. Probert: That's not necessarily a bad thing either because if we see some recovery, we have an opportunity to move things.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Sure, absolutely. That makes sense. And then Mark, I'm going to come ask a question on North American margins. Again, the gap down we saw from 1Q to 2Q was pretty significant. There are a lot of moving parts in there, but is it safe to say as we think about the rest of this year that, that we've already seen kind of the biggest gap down. Margins, of course, will go down as you've said, but have we seen the biggest kind of at least sequential drop?
Mark A. McCollum: Yes, definitely.
Operator: Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Could you, Tim, talk a little about what you're seeing in frac pricing today? Are you seeing some areas that have starting to stabilizing -- starting to stabilize or they're still declining? And then, of your term contracts on percentage terms, can you say generally how much has actually rolled over at least to today's spot market prices versus still has yet to roll over? And then as you roll over your contracts, has any of the terms changed besides pricing?
Timothy J. Probert: Okay, just a couple of comments on the sort of sequencing of pricing, I guess. As Dave mentioned, the dry basins have been the most challenging to this point, but they appear to be stabilizing. And secondly, the next in the sequence was the more accessible oily basins, which received the greatest pressure like the Eagle Ford, for example. But I think that, really, the changing terms that we see, I think, are solely restricted at this point to pricing and term as we just referenced on the question with James. And I do want to sort of reinforce the fact here that we tend to not talk about this too much. But outside pressure pumping, really, all -- pretty much all other product lines are very stable in their pricing outlook, so we're dealing with a single product line here. Did I miss anything from your question?
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Yes, and then one more. You did a great job. But one more is that on your term contracts, how many of the contracts, as a percentage terms, have rolled over to today's spot rates or have yet to roll over?
Timothy J. Probert: We're still on a sort of 80% to 85% contract basis. And as I mentioned before that we're much more evenly oriented through the year in terms of our renewals these days than we were several years ago. So it's hard for me to give you an exact percentage, but clearly we're a ways through the conversion process.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: All right. And then as a follow-up or unrelated follow-up. On the international markets, obviously congratulations on the record results there on the revenue side. You've had very impressive market share gains. Are you going to start -- from here going forward, will you start to put international margins as a priority over additional market share gains, or is market share gains still your #1 priority?
Timothy J. Probert: No, we think we can do both. And the reason we say that is, as Dave referred to, we're focused on a couple of things. We're focused on the economies of scale and that is being large enough in a given market to be able to be as efficient as we can be, which we can't say in all markets has been the case historically; and secondly, the issue around underserved markets, markets which we have had a very, very limited presence in; and thirdly, the repair of certain markets, which have been damaged through time. So are we going to focus on margins, are we focusing on margins? Absolutely, but this is not a binary equation. We're going to do both.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just stick on the international side. Question on the margin expansion you had talked about in Eastern Hemisphere in second half of the year. Is this all going to be volume-driven on basically this cost absorption at this point? And how soon can we start thinking about the impact of pricing and technology upside? Are we like a couple of quarters away, I guess I'm just trying to hone in, a little bit more specific on that question.
Timothy J. Probert: So I think that clearly, there is a volume effect. We're starting to see -- finally see the rig count activity move, which is encouraging. It's been really, it's been slow-growing to this point in terms of the move of rig count. So volume is an element. We're clearly seeing sort of a bifurcation in terms of contract structure; the very, very large contracts are still quite challenging from a pricing standpoint. But we're pushing pricing where we can on smaller contracts and I think we have some good examples from each of our operating regions where pricing has actually moved. So it's going to be a combination of both those elements.
Mark A. McCollum: Part of the situation, David, is we'll still have some mobilization cost during the, really the next 2 quarters as we mobilize on some of the new contract wins that we've had. But that's -- we still think our overall forecast at the margin targets that we set are very, very achievable. And it's based on a lot of deepwater activity we're seeing coming into the market, as well as the repair of these markets that we've been working on quite a bit that's sort of within our control to manage the cost side.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then I guess just switching over or switching back to North America. Dave, you had mentioned getting back to normalized margins levels in North America. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of a peek into your playbook there. I mean, how does that play out under your base case scenario? I don't know if you're assuming oil prices hold here? You had talked about rig count kind of modestly declining the rest of the year. How does this all kind of play out in terms of the way you're looking at this? And particularly in light of limited capacity additions, kind of trying to figure out kind of as this market tightens, I mean how are you guys thinking about the different mechanisms that have to happen here to get back to normalized margins?
David J. Lesar: I think, obviously, Dave, the big one is to get the sort of guar pig through the python, as we call it, sort of here internally. That's actually will have the most impact on moving margins back up. Second is the playbook says that as the gas rig count comes down, oil continues to go up. You have the issue around the liquids plays today. But for us, it's a pretty simple strategy: use our economies of scale, number one; pull through additional product lines with the products we have and even in a looser market from a frac equipment standpoint, the execution reliability and the ability to demonstrate that we have a better response in terms of production to our PE activities does allow us to pull through other product lines; and then I think is letting the dust settle around a lot of these equipment moves that we've had to make, as we've moved not only frac equipment now but also other product line equipment out of the gas plays into the liquids and oil plays. So we have a lot of equipment on the move right now. We've got a lot of people on the move, but I think those would be the elements that, as the dust settles on them, should allow our margins to basically get back to where they would be considered normal, actually without a tremendous amount, if any, ability to increase prices.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Mark and Dave, you provided us with a margin target for Eastern Hemisphere and looks like you're well on your way to doing that, upper teens by year-end and mid-teens for the year. Any thoughts with regard to how Latin America margins progress from this point forward with the thought in mind that it sounds like you guys have won this big tender in Brazil on the MWD or LWD front or are well positioned to do so? Mark, you've talked about increased mob costs the next couple of quarters, I assume that relates in part to that. How do Latin America margins unfold from this point?
Mark A. McCollum: Well, one of the larger drivers of margins for the back half of the year will not only be the playing out of that mob cost, which a big chunk of that will be finished toward the end of the third quarter but also, as Dave mentioned, we've got some other work that we know is coming on the Landmark, the software sales and service consulting work that typically shows itself across-the-board in Latin America, particularly in Mexico. That is just now getting underway. It's very high-margin business and if you look at over the last couple of years, our Latin America margins were relatively benign coming out of the first quarter recovery sort of activity levels and then jumped significantly in the back part of the year. And so as we look at the volume of activity that we're doing, particularly across not only Brazil but Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador and then Mexico, this pickup of activity in Mexico around the Remolino lab, the -- our southern alliance project and then this Landmark pop that we get at the end of the year, we feel pretty good about where that will move and it should meet or exceed our levels that we had achieved last year, which were, at that point in time, sort of back to sort of normalized record levels of Latin America margins.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Okay, great. And then secondly, Dave, you talked about sort of a recipe, if you will, for North American margin recovery. Oil rig count moving higher was one of your stipulations. Assuming that basically WTI doesn't have significant uplift from here, the E&P industry continues to be somewhat cash flow-constrained and the oil rig count is basically flattish from this point forward, can margins get back to target levels in a relatively flattish environment?
Mark A. McCollum: Well, I -- this is Mark. I think that the ultimate issue is that probably in a relatively flattish market, the answer would be no other than the recovery of the loss that we've had around the guar inventory. Once that flushes through, we've given you a roadmap as to what that should add back. But I think as we look ahead, it's difficult to see a relatively flat rig count environment if commodity prices hold at this level for a significant period of time. I mean, we think at some point here in the next quarter or 2, the gas rig count is going to basically bottom out. And once that does, the oil rig count should be able to grow unfettered, which should provide some upside to it. The other side of it that we see also is the Gulf of Mexico recovery, which, again, is counting, as we look at the end of the year, should be approaching 40 deepwater rigs. We think our share is higher in this type of market than it was in the previous upturn and that provides some fairly significant margin uplift as well to the numbers that should help.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Dahlman Rose.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Back to North American pressure pumping, my question is not on new contracts but on existing term contracts that you have. Are you, in any cases, willing to renegotiate an existing contract down to keep, let's say, all the associated work that you have with it? The fluids, the bits, the wireline completions, et cetera?
Timothy J. Probert: The one thing I think we can say is that the contract -- the sanctity, if you like, of the contract structure has been very, very good. And Jim, in life everything is negotiable. I mean, if there is a quid pro quo which makes sense for us, then a renegotiation may well take place. So I think suffice to say that we -- as Dave had said, we're very focused on maximizing the pull-through for our operations from our hydraulic fracturing footprint. And if that were, for example, to be an opportunity for us to negotiate, then that would be a good example of something we'd probably go for.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: So you're -- so if we're looking at sort of the percentage of fleet -- frac fleets that you have under, let's just say, old pricing, it seems that at least it's a possibility that the prices could come down a bit just for the frac piece of it earlier than, I guess, than what the original contracts would suggest?
David J. Lesar: Yes, I guess, Jim, this is Dave, it's possible but as Tim said, there's a quid pro quo with everything. And so we're -- if we trade off some frac pricing early before the contract, we're going to insist on additional market share with that customer or we're going to insist on pull-through of other services. From a customer's perspective, they're going to spend it with us or spend it with somebody else, so that's actually a pretty good conversation to be in with a customer.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery of Tudor Pickering & Company.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: In North America, we spent a lot of time talking about margins, but revenue was quite good this quarter. And what you see from an activity standpoint plus Canadian, albeit kind of weaker seasonal recovery than normal, is revenue able to grow in the third quarter, you think?
Mark A. McCollum: The answer is yes. I mean typically Q3 is our strongest quarter of the year, our highest activity levels across-the-board. Yes, Canada is getting a little bit of a slow start this quarter. Don't know whether that will persist or not. But as Dave mentioned, we're continuing to add equipment. It's going to work. We know it's going to go to work and that's part of what's creating the uplift on our revenue side as well. We also believe that Gulf of Mexico will continue to improve during the third quarter as well. So all in all, revenue is expected to be up.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: And the follow-up question, just on the domestic D&E segment. Given that Gulf of Mexico op income doubled for the company sequentially, I'm surprised that the margins eroded as much as they did. Was that just a really harsh Canada or can you give us some color on what happened?
Timothy J. Probert: Yes, we have particularly high exposure for D&E in Canada and that hit us quite hard during the quarter. Secondly, we also had some sort of end effects associated with some relocations from gas basins into oily plays, which impacted us quite a bit as well. But our expectation for D&E as we move into Q3 is that we will recover and we'll be at or modestly above the Q1 D&E numbers for Q3.
Operator: Our next question will come from Mike Urban of Deutsche Bank.
Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Wanted to talk about Iraq a little bit. Sounds like activity continuing to ramp up there. You did reference some costs in the quarter. Was that above and beyond what you had expected or just a function of the higher activity in some of the bids that we've seen in that market?
Mark A. McCollum: I think the honest answer is yes. It was a little bit above what we have expected that it would be. Across Iraq, we've had some good activity. Our business across almost every single one of our projects has done very, very well. We also have had some issues around getting diesel and things out to some of our sites. The issues, as I referenced, really are isolated to the Majnoon contract and that's been probably -- that's the one field which is sort of the, from a logistic standpoint, is a furthest field that we deal with. And that's where diesel's been an issue. Some of the rigs sort of staying engaged have been an issue. And so we took some additional cost on Majnoon in the quarter that we were not expecting. We're continuing to try to work on that. I think that we feel positive about what else is happening there and we feel positive about Iraq in the long term. This one particular project has been a little bit of an issue and we're trying to get that righted so that overall results -- I mean that sort of what's standing between us and profitability is this particular project, and we're almost there.
Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And could you expand a little bit on the outlook there in terms of where you're going? Again, I think there were some additional work being bid, additional projects, maybe Kurdistan a little bit, and just kind of your path there going forward in terms of potential additional ramp-up versus volume and contracts and the path to profitability there?
Mark A. McCollum: We won a project with Gazprom during the quarter, I think that was publicly announced and so feel good about that. We are doing a little bit of work in Kurdistan and are looking for opportunities to expand our operations to the North as well. So we're continuing to feel pretty good about what's happening there and looking at other various opportunities. It's going to be a slow and measured pace just like the rest of Eastern Hemisphere. But from a long-term perspective, we feel great about that market.
Kelly Youngblood: Operator, you can now close the call. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton First Quarter 2012 Earnings Release Conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kelly Youngblood, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days. The press release announcing the first quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are: Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development.  I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's view about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release announcing the first quarter results which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website.  During the quarter, we recorded a $300 million charge, which amounts to $190 million after tax or $0.20 per diluted share for estimated loss contingencies related to the Macondo well incident. In our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of this charge on our financial results. As always, we will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. Dave?
David J. Lesar: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. I'm very pleased to report the following results that were achieved in the first quarter. Total revenue of $6.9 billion and operating income of $1.3 billion represents growth over the first quarter of 2011 of 30% and 63%, respectively, which I believe demonstrates how well we have executed against our targeted investment strategies. These are very strong results, especially considering the industry disruptions in North America related to rig movements and the harsh weather we experienced in the Eastern Hemisphere in Q1. Despite these challenges, we achieved record revenue during the first quarter in our North America region. Globally, both our cementing and Baroid product lines achieved record revenues in the first quarter, with cementing also setting a record for operating income.  Looking at the North America results for the first quarter. Our revenue grew sequentially by 1% compared to a U.S. rig count decline of 1%. Now while 1% seems small, it's actually the net impact of a significant rig shift that is taking place in the U.S. between natural gas and oil. And operating income was down sequentially by 5%, driven by the inefficiencies associated with equipment relocations, cost inflation and certain pricing pressures in certain basins.  Last quarter, we spoke in detail about the disruptions resulting from rig movements between basins. Depressed natural gas prices have accelerated the shift from natural gas to oil plays during the quarter. In the U.S., the natural gas rig count declined 151 rigs or 19% just since the beginning of the year. And that slightly outpaced the oil-directed rig count increase of 125 rigs or 10% over the same period. So while the total rig count only declined 1%, the shift from natural gas to oil was dramatic and disruptive to operations.  In our fourth quarter call, we talked about 8 frac fleets moving from primarily natural gas plays to liquids plays. We now have an additional 5 fleets that have moved or are in the process of moving this quarter. Due to the stability of oil prices, oils in the liquid-rich plays are generating higher returns for our customers. This shift is very positive for us as completing these wells requires higher levels of service intensity due to the advanced fluid and completion technologies, which creates an additional opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves from our competition. While these moves are beneficial to us in the long run, they do not come without a short-term impact on our margins. With spot natural gas prices down approximately 50% from this time last year due to the resiliency of natural gas productions in a very mild winter, so at the current prices, we expect to see further declines in the natural gas rig count until we begin to see a meaningful decrease in production levels. Over time, we believe any future weakness in natural gas rig count will be offset by an increase in oil and liquids-rich activity, resulting in an overall yearly percentage increase in the U.S. rig count in the mid-single-digits.  Also on our last call, we provided our outlook for North America margins for the first quarter. Our revenue was strong this quarter due to better-than-expected activity levels. But our margins were just below our expectations, given that the drop-off in natural gas rig count was more pronounced than we anticipated. Continued significant cost inflation also negatively impacted our margins. As a reminder, there is often a delay between vendor price increases and when we are able to pass these increases to our customers. In the natural gas basins, in particular, this is becoming more difficult and we are working with our vendors for price relief. However, this will take time and may continue to impact margins throughout the remainder of 2012.  As we renew contracts and win new work, we expect to see frac pricing become more challenging, but the impact will vary by basin. The dry natural gas basins will be the most challenged, followed by those more easily accessible oily basins that are located close to natural gas basins, such as the Eagle Ford. We expect pricing pressure in some of these markets in the near term but believe that these pressures will decline over the remainder of the year. On the other hand, our other product service lines continue to have relatively stable pricing.  I would like to review some of the key differentiators that I believe make us unique and should continue to enable us to outperform our competition in North America. First, I want to recognize our supply chain organization, whose efforts over the past few years have positioned us well for the current industry challenges. In the 2009 downturn, when many of our peers halted new investment, we recognized the structural changes that were incurring in the North American market. We continued to manufacture new equipment, build logistical infrastructure and develop strong relationships with key suppliers and lock in critical supply agreements. In some cases, we actually provided funding to assist our suppliers with their own internal expansion needs so they could meet our supply requirements. Our leading market position and long-term commitment to North America have helped us secure supplies for key commodities in a very tight market, which has enabled us to minimize supply and logistical disruptions to our customers. The shift of rigs from natural gas to oil has amplified supply chain issues for the industry. We recognize that we are not immune to these challenges. However, we believe our supply chain organization gives us a distinct advantage that should allow us to effectively outperform our competition in 2012.  To make our logistics process more efficient, we have been constructing transloading facilities in key basins that transfer materials directly from railcars to truck or storage. This reduces our overall transportation to merge costs and improves our efficiencies and allows us to better serve our customers. We strongly believe we will continue to be able to provide our customers with the proppants, guar and other materials they require to be successful as they expand their activities toward oil. I do not believe that many of our competitors can make this statement. In particular, guar, which is a thickening agent used in certain fracturing treatments, is expected to be in scarce supply this year. And although we believe we have secured enough supply for our customers, there have been significant cost increases in guar which are negatively impacting our margins. We are currently working to recover this increased guar cost from our customers. To give you some idea of the magnitude of this increase, the guar gel system cost alone can now represent more than 30% of the total frac price to our customer in certain basins. Additionally, we expect to see some vendor price relief in the second half of the year on our proppant costs.  Also customer relationships and mix are very important differentiators. Over the past few years, we have carefully aligned ourselves with operators that are running large-scale operations and whose focus is on reliability and value and not just price. We believe we have successfully proven that our superior service quality, reliability and efficiency make us the preferred service company. Price competition today is most pronounced in the transactional market, which we have and will continue to generally avoid. We acknowledge that we are not immune to pricing pressures either. But as contracts renew, we believe we will continue to get superior margins due to our customer mix.  In addition, a high percentage of our crews provide 24/7 operations. This is a win-win scenario for us and our customers. Our customers recognize our ability to provide them with a manufacturing-type efficiency model, which ultimately reduces their overall completion cost. This generally enables us to obtain superior margins compared to our peers. Through this efficiency and incremental capacity, we are now able to provide services to customers that we could not get to in the past, and I believe will actually result in a market share increase without us having to discount price on a relative basis.  And lastly, we continue to expand our capabilities and drive efficiency through technology and redesign of our operations. Our Frac of the Future initiative is a perfect example of how we are staying one step ahead of the competition. We have just rolled out our first series of Q10 pumps, which we believe are the most efficient and lowest-maintenance pumps in the industry. We are also deploying smartphone technology to automate many of the tasks that are now performed manually in the industry today, which we believe will improve efficiency, reduce our operating costs and reduce working capital requirements. We are also working to optimize crew size and centralize functions to be more cost-efficient. As we have highlighted in the past and will continue to highlight, these and other strategic costs have an immediate negative impact on our earnings. However, they are a future investment in continuing to differentiate ourselves in the market.  Turning to the Gulf of Mexico. We remain optimistic about the recovery of activity and believe that margins will continue to increase as our customers adapt to new regulations and industry efficiency improves. The increase in permit approval should lead to additional deepwater rigs arriving throughout 2012. Our first quarter margins in the Gulf were lower than the prior quarter due to a different mix between drilling and completion-related revenue activities, mainly driven by customer delays of certain completions, an area where we hold the highest market share. We are very optimistic about the future work we see in the Gulf and we have secured additional directional drilling, drilling fluids, wireline and completion work on a number of the new deepwater rigs coming into the Gulf and some of the rigs that are going back to work in the next few quarters.  So to summarize North America, we believe increased activity of our customers due to the strong liquids prices, access to capital and increase in service intensity are supportive of a healthy market for us in 2012. However, we expect continued short-term inefficiencies and, therefore, downward pressure on margins in the near term due to the shift in our equipment, commodity price mix and pricing pressure and the spring breakup in Canada. We currently expect these transitory disruptions to decrease the second half of 2012.  Also to be noted, I believe the growing scope of our Canadian business is underestimated due to the size of our U.S. business. I'm pleased to say that Canada is expected to deliver a $1 billion revenue stream for us this year and is a good contributor to our North American profitability. Therefore, we expect to be impacted by the spring breakup in this year's second quarter in Canada more than we have been in the past. So although 2012 will be challenging for North America, I believe it will just be another opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves from our peers and continue to drive our strategy of superior growth, margins and returns.  Now turning to our international results. They were basically in line with our previously stated expectations. We are very optimistic about our Latin America business this year. Latin America posted solid results for the first quarter, taking into consideration the typical first quarter impact of lower consulting and software sales as compared to the fourth quarter. We continue to see shale development opportunities evolving. We are excited about leveraging our expertise in unconventional resources to help our customers unlock the potential of these plays.  We delivered great production results on our Remolino field lab in Mexico, and Tim will cover that in a few minutes. Based on tendered prices that we have seen, we also believe that we are well positioned to win significant incremental work on the recent bids for Brazil in wireline, directional drilling and testing. As a result, we expect to incur mobilization costs in the second half of 2012 that will temporarily impact Latin American profitability. Brazil was the largest contributor to our operating income increase over the first quarter of 2011 in Latin America and we expect it to continue to grow rapidly.  Our strategy in the Eastern Hemisphere is also playing out as expected, as is evident by our revenue growth in excess of the rig count growth. Eastern Hemisphere revenue was up 14% from the first quarter of 2011. We continue to make progress in markets that had been negatively impacting our results and are optimistic about activity levels expanding into the second half of 2012. For instance, in East Africa, we continue to see activity levels increase. While startup costs had a negative impact on margins in 2011, we are now seeing our deepwater investment strategy begin to pay off in this important growth market. We also took action the last few quarters to improve our profitability in our operations in the U.K. Our efforts are now paying off there. Despite weather-related seasonality, we saw stronger operational results and are now generating healthy margins in that market.  In Iraq, we continue to run 5 rigs and expect to add additional rigs and workover rigs in 2012, enabling us to improve our profitability as activity levels increase. Overall, we remain enthusiastic about the future of our Iraq operations and are pleased to be getting the past issues behind us. In Libya, production is also coming back online. However, we are still awaiting well-defined operational plans from our customers. We do not expect to approach pre-2011 activity levels in Libya until late 2012 or 2013. So our view of the international markets has not changed at all. We anticipate international pricing will continue to remain competitive, particular in regard to larger projects being tendered. We continue to expect our margin improvement through 2012 as new projects ramp up. We introduced new technology and continue to improve our results in those markets, where we have made strategic investments and secured key wins over the past few years.  To give you more granularity on the financial results, I'll turn it over to Mark.
Mark A. McCollum: Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our revenue in the first quarter was $6.9 billion, down 3% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Total operating income for the first quarter was $1.3 billion, down 7% sequentially. North America revenue grew 1%, while operating income declined 5% compared with the previous quarter. As Dave mentioned, inefficiencies associated with equipment relocations, continuing cost inflation and pricing pressures in certain basins impacted our margins during the first quarter. We expect disruptions related to rig movements to impact us in the near term. And perhaps with the exception of guar, we anticipate some relief from suppliers in the second half of the year related to high cost of proppants and other materials.  Due to these challenges and the negative impact of the seasonal Canadian spring breakup, we expect to see lower revenues and margins dropping by 200 to 250 basis points in the second quarter. We also now anticipate margins could drift toward the low 20 range by the end of 2012. The market is understandably very dynamic right now. These margin expectations depend on, among other things, our success in recovering inflationary cost increases from our customers and how soon the natural gas rig count levels off. We should have a better feel for this after the second quarter.  Internationally, revenue and operating income declined compared to the previous quarter, driven by the traditional seasonal reduction of our international business. In the first quarter, we also usually see weather-related weakness in the North Sea and Eurasia, and this year was no different. As we look ahead, we anticipate our Eastern Hemisphere margins will reach the mid- to upper-teens in the second half of 2012 and average in the mid-teens for the full year.  Now looking at our first quarter results sequentially by division. Completion and Production revenue declined $38 million or 1%, primarily due to seasonally lower Completion Tool sales and first quarter weather disruptions in the North Sea, Eurasia and Australia. Completion and Production operating income declined 5%, primarily due to North American inefficiencies associated with equipment relocations and other factors that Dave mentioned earlier.  Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis. North America revenue increased by 1%, driven by increased activity in the U.S. oil and liquids-rich basins and Canada. This was partially offset by activity decreases in the U.S. dry gas basins in the Gulf of Mexico. Operating income declined 7% due to equipment relocations, cost inflation and stimulation pricing. In Latin America, Completion and Production posted a 2% sequential decrease in revenue due to reduced submitting activity in Colombia and Mexico and lower Completion Tool sales in Brazil and Trinidad. Operating income grew by 8% as a result of increased Boots & Coots activity in Mexico and Venezuela.  In Europe/Africa/CIS, Completion and Production revenue decreased 8%, primarily related to lower activity in the North Sea and Eurasia due to the normal first quarter seasonal weather impact. Operating income increased 30% due to increased Boots & Coots profitability throughout almost all of Africa, along with higher cementing activity in Mozambique. Also contributing to the profit increase was higher production enhancement and cementing activity in Libya, along with a collection of some of the receivables that were written off there in early 2011. This was partially offset by seasonally lower activity in the North Sea and Russia and lower cementing and production enhancement profitability in Angola. In Middle East/Asia, Completion and Production revenue decreased by 7%, primarily due to seasonally lower Completion Tool sales across the region and seasonal weather issues in Australia. Operating income increased 2% due to increased cementing and production enhancement activity in Oman and additional Boots & Coots activity in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Indonesia.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income decreased primarily due to seasonally lower software and direct product sales in the first quarter as well seasonal weather disruptions in the North Sea, Eurasia and Australia. In North America, Drilling and Evaluation's revenue and operating income were up 2% and 7%, respectively, due to higher activity in drilling fluids, directional drilling and increased drillbit sales in U.S. land, as well as higher wireline activity in Canada. These increases were partially offset by lower software sales and decreased drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico due to scheduling delays that we expect to make up next quarter.  Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income decreased primarily due to seasonally lower software sales and the normal first quarter delay in obtaining contract approvals for consulting services and software sales in Mexico, as well as lower directional drilling activity in the first quarter in Mexico. In the Europe/Africa/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income were down due to the seasonally lower software sales, seasonal weather impacts in the North Sea and Asia and lower drilling activity in Algeria and Angola. This decrease was partially offset by increased drilling activity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East/Asia revenue and operating income decreased due primarily to lower first quarter product sales in Asia that were partially offset by increased drilling activity in Saudi Arabia and higher project management activity in Iraq.  Our results for the first quarter reflect a $300 million accrual in Corporate and Other expense for estimated loss contingencies related to Macondo. At the request of the court, in late February, we participated in a series of discussions with the magistrate judge relating to whether the multidistrict litigation or MDL could be settled. Although those discussions did not result in a settlement, we've accrued $300 million, reflecting our current estimate of the loss contingencies that are probable relating to the MDL. Our decision to take an accrual now in the amount we have recognized are based on our assessment of all of the facts and circumstances regarding the litigation at this point in time. Although we continue to believe that we have substantial legal arguments and defenses against any liability and that BP is required to indemnify us for any losses we may ultimately incur, we've determined that we can no longer conclude that a probable loss associated with the MDL is 0. There are other contingencies related to the Macondo well incident that are reasonably possible and for which a reasonable estimate cannot currently be made. We're constantly monitoring and evaluating developments relating to the MDL and the other Macondo-related lawsuits and investigations. And it's possible that we may adjust our estimate of these loss contingencies in the future as new information becomes known.  Apart from the Macondo-related charge, our Corporate and Other expense came in lower than expected in the first quarter due in large part to the timing of expenses related to our continued investment in our initiative to reinvent our service delivery platform in North America and to reposition our supply chain, manufacturing and technology infrastructure to better support our projected international growth. The expense related to these initiatives during the quarter totaled approximately $23 million, which was slightly less than we had expected. However, the activities behind the cost are on schedule and we continue to ramp up through 2012. We anticipate the impact of these investments will be approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per share after-tax in the second quarter. In total, we anticipate that corporate expenses will range between $110 million and $115 million per quarter for the remainder of 2012, which, for the total year, is in line with our previous guidance.  We anticipate that our CapEx for the year will still be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. But we've decided to defer some of the North American pressure pumping equipment deliveries into 2013 that were originally planned for 2012. In addition, more capital will be allocated to international projects that we've recently secured or expect to win in the next couple of quarters. We're also allocating a significant amount of capital for infrastructure needs throughout the globe and in support of growth of our recent acquisitions. And finally, our effective tax rate was 32.3% for the first quarter, but the average rate was helped by the higher U.S. tax rate that was applied to the Macondo-related charge. We currently expect the full year 2012 effective tax rate will be approximately 33% to 34%, in line with the normalized rate we saw in the first quarter. Tim?
Timothy J. Probert: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Dave outlined earlier on the call, we've been very consistent in our outlook for our international markets, where we continue to expect gradual activity improvement based on meaningful increments in customer spending patterns and corresponding new rig arrivals. Growth drivers for us in the international markets revolve around the execution of our strategy in deepwater, mature assets and unconventionals.  In deepwater, we continue to be pleased with our positioning. And globally, the deepwater services market is expected to grow by approximately 20% per year through 2015, with exploration spending growing 4% annually and development growing by 35% annually. And as this shift gets underway, we feel that Halliburton's well positioned to participate in all established and emerging markets. In East Africa, for example, there are now 5 deepwater rigs running compared to just 1 this time last year. And our new basins in Mozambique and Tanzania are now well established as a platform for long-term development there. Establishing a stronger position in deepwater for our wireline and testing services has been a priority for us, both in terms of technology development and market positioning. In addition to wins in East Africa, the logging package fee win for Petrobras in Brazil is a positive indication of our credibility in this market. We also believe, as Dave mentioned, we're well positioned for the deepwater drilling and testing tenders in Brazil.  In mature assets, our customers continue to look for assistance in evaluating, planning and executing redevelopment programs. In Mexico, for example, our customer PEMEX took a thoughtful approach to redevelopment in Chicontepec. Our Remolino field lab generated an improved understanding of the subsurface, and combined with new technology applications and joint team work, is delivering outstanding results. The PA-1565 well that Halliburton drilled had an initial production above 3,800 barrels a day and delivered cumulative production equivalent to over 20 average wells in the region. This is a model which is being applied in other mature assets in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, and one which we expect to have a positive business impact in the latter half of this year and into 2013. Halliburton's EquiFlow Autonomous Inflow Control Device is a key technology to facilitate mature asset development and has been introduced in several wells in Latin America and the Middle East. It's a 2012 Offshore Technology Conference Spotlight on New Technology Award winner and is a simple, reliable device developed to address problems of unwanted water or gas production and solves the problems of inefficiency in current inflow device designs.  International unconventional development continues to provide increasing levels of encouragement to us. Halliburton has active frac spreads in Poland, Argentina, Mexico, Australia, Saudi and elsewhere, which is allowing us to build the requisite basin and subsurface expertise necessary for successful execution and is building a strong foundation for future growth. We're also pleased with the recently signed Framework Agreement between PETRONAS Carigali and Halliburton for the evaluation and development of global shale resources. This collaboration is expected to leverage our technology and expertise to enable PETRONAS to quickly gain experience in shale development. We plan to work with them to set up a Shale Technical Centre of Excellence in Kuala Lumpur. Dave?
David J. Lesar: Okay, thanks, Tim. Let me just quickly summarize, and then we'll go to questions. We're very proud of the results that we delivered in the first quarter, with double-digit percentage growth in the first quarter of 2012 in all geographies in most product lines. In North America, the impact of inefficiencies from rigs moving from natural gas to oily basins to pricing pressure and cost inflation will impact our profitability in 2012. We plan to mitigate these impacts through continued focus on execution, efficient supply chain management and cost recovery from our customers. We remain very optimistic about our Latin America business and believe recent operational success and contract wins position us well for the future. And we continue to be optimistic about Eastern Hemisphere, where we expect our margins will continue to improve throughout the remainder of 2012.  So let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Well, I'm sure you get a lot of questions about pressure pumping pricing. So I guess, my angle on this is I'm curious about where spot prices are now relative to the pricing on your existing term contracts. Just wondering, are spot prices now in line with term? And how would you expect those contracts to get repriced? I mean, would it be a material change, is it down 10%? And I guess as follow-up to that, are you starting to see E&Ps sign up any term contracts now? Or is it still too early?
Timothy J. Probert: Well, Dave, this is Tim. We're still 80% to 85% long-term contracts. And so our exposure to the spot market is really quite limited. And clearly, there is, as Dave pointed out, a more aggressive stance in those spot markets, but it's one which frankly we're just not exposed to that much.
Mark A. McCollum: And let me also -- Dave, this is Mark. I'd also add, it definitely varies by basin in terms of the, we're still signing up term contracts. We have customers in certain of the liquids basins that are only re-signing up for term contracts, they're extending the contracts that they have and they're still continuing to be at fairly good prices.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: But are they lower than they were before, I guess, is my question. And how much lower? Is it like a 10%, is it material?
Mark A. McCollum: In some of the oil basins, the answer is no, they're not lower.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And I would assume the Eagle Ford is probably the most vulnerable out of all of those?
Timothy J. Probert: Yes. I mean, clearly, its proximity to the Haynesville makes it a much more vulnerable basin.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And as a related question, you were talking about your CapEx, and it looks like you're on track to spend less. But Mark, it sounded like you just kind of reiterated your $3.5 billion to $4 billion number. Just wondering if the North America market doesn't show any signs of tightening, you're saying you think your second half looks a little bit better. But if that doesn't happen, would you expect spending to start -- to cut spending and maybe be below that range? And now you've got Macondo just on the rearview mirror, just wondering what the thoughts are. I mean is there a potential for a buyback here, when you -- considering where your stock is trading now? If you cut CapEx, maybe buy back here at $32 here?
Mark A. McCollum: Well, let me take the questions in order. I think with regard to CapEx, I still feel very confident that we're going to spend in that range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. What I was trying to reiterate, that even though we may slowing down some of the equipment deliveries in North America, there's still quite a bit infrastructure that we're building out related to our facilities, the transloading facilities for sand and other activities here in the U.S., as well as we are winning quite a bit of international tenders that are requiring incremental capital to what we had built into our original plan. And so there is a shift of CapEx fairly immediately for mobilization into some additional international work that we're pretty excited about. So in total, I don't see a big shift and it's difficult for me to see, based on the outlook right now, that we would step down meaningfully from the CapEx number. Now towards your second question. We accrued something on Macondo. It's one of those that based on our evaluation of events that had transpired through the course of the quarter, we felt the need to do that under U.S. GAAP. However, I would say that we're a long way from having Macondo behind us. I mean, right now, we are still in litigation mode. There's still a fairly uncertain calendar as to when events around Macondo will take place. And so until such time as Macondo is dealt with in its entirety, I think it's going to be difficult for us to strategize on what other kind of corporate initiatives we might do with regard to any excess cash that we might have.
Operator: Our next question comes from James West of Barclays.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Mark, quick question for you on North American margins. So we've got another decline in the second quarter, 200, 250 basis points. And then you alluded to margins perhaps dropping into the low 20% range, I think, in the second half. Correct me if I'm wrong on that.
Mark A. McCollum: Yes. It's sort of the trend toward the end of the year is what I'm alluding to.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. So is that -- would that represent the bottom, given what you see currently in North America? I mean, some of that's just a mismatch between vendors, and some of the pricing declines in pressure pumping. And then is this -- are you backing off earlier statements that you guys have made that normalized margins would be more like in the mid-20s? Or is that still achievable after we kind of shake out 2012?
Mark A. McCollum: Well, to the first question that you ask, I think based on what we can see today, yes, that low 20s feels like that, that's a bottom. But again, as I mentioned, there's still a lot of movement out there. It's a very dynamic market, and so we'll continue to try to adjust as we see. I think towards your second question, our comments last quarter about normalizing in the mid-20s, related really to our outlook for the year of 2012. It's difficult at this juncture, given the dramatic decrease in the gas rig count and the current outlook for gas, to say that we would normalize at that point there. I mean, that's – so I am -- we're kind of coming off of that earlier guidance, at least with regard to 2012. I'm not going to try to crystal-ball where we see things going in 2013. But I do think structurally, in our business, when you look long term, through the cycles themselves, that mid-20s range is essentially where our business tends to operate. And we are driving initiatives inside the company to reduce our cost structure in a way that can give us a fighting chance even if the market begins to flatten out toward the end of the year that we can find our way back to those mid-20s range if we execute well against our cost initiatives.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, that's very helpful. And then just one question on the international side of the business. Is there real spare capacity internationally right now? And if not, at what point do you think we do start to see real pricing traction? Or are we just going to let the offshore drillers have all the fun here?
Timothy J. Probert: Yes, James, this is Tim. I think just really following on from one of the remarks that Mark just made now that the shift of capital to the international markets, I think that's, if you like, a proof point really. If there was significant excess capacity, then we wouldn't be needing to move assets to the international market. So no, I would say that our general view is that, obviously, market-to-market, it's going to be slightly different. But in general terms, no, there's not a significant overhang of assets in the international markets today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes. My question relates also to deepwater. You had mentioned a target of growing at a rate above market growth in deepwater. I just wanted to see, as we stand today, where you are versus that growth plan and where do you see it could be a year from now.
Timothy J. Probert: This is Tim again. Obviously, we selected deepwater as an important growth market for us in which to invest because of the significant above-market growth rate of the segment itself. And then we set ourselves a target of growing at above the market growth rate ourselves as a company. So I think point number one is the market is really unfolding as we hoped it would. It's going to be a very strong growth segment. Secondly, we're very pleased with our positioning. And I think we're able to support our thesis that we're growing at a faster-than-market rate.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then in terms of international shale growth, what's your view right now? We've heard some mixed views out of Poland recently. There've been some upheavals in Argentina recently. What's your current view on that? Are you seeing -- are you more positive now on international shale development or less? Could you comment on that?
Timothy J. Probert: Yes, I think we continue to be very encouraged. I think that we've always said that the best thing is for us to have interest in multiple markets because not all markets will be successful. We know that. But having a position in all major markets around the globe allows us to make sure that we're going to participate in those markets that are successful. We continue to feel very good about shales. I think that the truth is, though, to your question, we're probably shifting our emphasis a little bit. Argentina doesn't feel as positive as it probably was 6 months ago. But Saudi Arabia feels a lot more positive than it was 6 months ago. So I think we're starting to see, if you like, the 3 key factors of shales, the combination of the geology, the infrastructure and the pricing and regulatory environment sort of start to come to the fore. And those that have all 3 in the right measure will be the ones that'll move forward the fastest.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So beyond Saudi Arabia, how would you rank like Poland and Australia and some of the other markets?
Timothy J. Probert: Well, certainly, Australia is looking strongly positive. China's looking extremely positive. And I wouldn't count Poland out yet. I mean, there's a relatively small number of wells, primarily vertical wells, I would call the sort of the frac process there to be very modest in terms of trying to establish what potential productivity would be. So I think we still have a long way to go yet in that particular market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Dahlman Rose.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: My first question is in provinces, in frac-ing, where you have seen significant pressure on pricing, is there any pressure by companies that you have long-term contracts in to renegotiate the terms of your contracts at lower prices, even if you have a longer-term contract? And have you done so in any instances?
David J. Lesar: Yes, Jim, this is Dave. Let me answer that one. And the answer is in those oily based areas, the answer is no. In fact, we have gone generally back in because of guar prices or proppant prices to get price increases. But we -- for the most part, we wrote those contracts to be pretty tight. So I suspect that the pressure will come when they start to roll over, and we've got to look at what we can do. But again, we're selling efficiency, we're selling lowest unit cost because of the efficiency. And I think we are having a different kind of conversation with those customers than maybe some of our competitors would have to have.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: And that's in oil provinces, Dave, in the Haynesville, if a long-term contract customer is asking for price relief, have you done so?
David J. Lesar: You know what, Jim, there's hardly anybody left in the Haynesville but Halliburton. So you can read into that comment what you will.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: But David, your comments would relate to any -- to all instances of long-term contracts across the country that they're sacrosanct and you're not lowering prices on any?
David J. Lesar: No, I think that we -- are we rolling pricing back on existing contracts? The answer is no, the contracts that have term left on them. Those that are coming up for tender, we are having discussions about where the market pricing for long-term types of contracts are. We are not going to spot market by any stretch of the imagination.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. David, my second question, sources of mine are still saying that on international tenders, particularly in formation evaluation and particularly in deepwater, there continues to be fierce competition in pricing. Would you concur with that or put some -- what color would you offer on that statement?
David J. Lesar: No. I think as we said in the prepared remarks, any large tenders, deepwater-related that have a big formation evaluation component to them are extraordinarily competitive for a couple of reasons. One, they tend to be big dollars and they tend to be of long duration. And so they are being fiercely fought over. And I guess, I would make an editorial comment that all of the big players are equally competitive in their pricing. But as Tim indicated, I think we're winning more than our fair share of them, which is a strategy we put in front of our shareholders in our Analyst Day a couple of years ago. That was a key part of our strategy. I think it's paying off in places like East Africa, where we did have to make infrastructure and mobilization investments. But if you look at the margins we're making there today, I'm very happy with them. And I expect that, that will continue to play out as we get these projects up and going. So bottom line is I'm very happy with our market penetration in FE and in deepwater and in places where we have not operated before. And we will continue that strategy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber of Bernstein.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I'm curious as to how the activity transition in North America is impacting operational uptime, looking beyond the mobilization issue. When you look out 6 months from now, will you experience an increase in operational uptime, more operations on 24 hours? Or would things be about the same from here?
David J. Lesar: Yes, I think -- this is Dave again. Again, go back to what we said. We are primarily a 24/7 operation, view our frac position in the U.S. as being more one akin to a manufacturing operation. And absent the dislocation of crews, which obviously have an impact on uptime and downtime, we don't move a crew unless we know where it's going, we know what customer it's working for and we know the price that it's going to work at. So we don't incur a cost to basically pick them up and move them somewhere without knowing what the financial impact is going to be. I would say that, that's not true with a lot of our competition who are being chased out of some of these basins, like the Haynesville, and those crews are going basically looking around for work. And that's why the transactional market pricing is so disruptive today. But as we said, that's not a market that we generally play in. So when we say we're moving a fleet, it's not going looking for work. It knows where it's going, knows who it's working for and knows the price that it's going to work at.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Got it. And does the 24-hour uptime extend to the Permian as well?
David J. Lesar: It's just starting to go there. And that's actually a great question because typically the Permian Basin has not been a market where the operators saw the need to have 24-hour operations. But we have actually gone to 24-hour operations with some of the bigger players out there and have demonstrated to them the efficiency of it. Now that's caused some disruption within the operators because they've had to change their work practices, their completion practices. But as it's gotten more competitive out there, they've seen the benefits of it. But even in a market that's traditionally not 24 hours, it's starting to basically embrace it.
Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Great. That's very encouraging. Last question on Canada, appreciate the color. In terms of growth CapEx in North America, I assume Canada's going to continue to be a focus as you build out that position.
Mark A. McCollum: No, absolutely, Scott. We -- not only -- there's some infrastructure capital that we're deploying there. We're focused on the extension of the Bakken into Southern Canada there and building out there but also helping in our infrastructure around sand logistics and things like that. We tend to view Canada -- I mean, even though it's a separate country, we tend to view capital deployed for rolling stock and things like that as a bit fungible between the U.S. and Canada. And so during breakup, oftentimes we'll move things back and forth to make sure that we maintain very high efficiency levels for those crews.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons & Company.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: A question on the cost inflation. Dave, for a couple quarters here, we've been talking about the lead lag here between incurring costs from vendors and being able to pass them through to the customer and with increasing difficulty, I guess, in dry gas plays. But in due course, you seem to foreshadow an ability to do that. I'm curious as to actually with regard to the cost of the raw material itself, guar, proppants, what-have-you. At what point do these headwinds with regard to margins become tailwinds with regard to the raw material itself becoming less expensive with more supply?
David J. Lesar: Yes. I think, certainly on guar, we've not reached that point. And yes, we clearly are able to, on things like guar, with some lag, get that cost passed through to our customer. The problem with guar, it's probably the fastest-moving commodity price that I've ever seen. I mean, basically, we might give a quote today that's 10% higher than a quote we would've got last week on it. So it is such a dynamic that we don't like to and don't want to go back to our customers multiple times to get price increases. So we try to get it stabilized within a certain area then go back to the customer and basically put it through as a pass-through item. But that is the one, because of the scarcity at this moment in time -- and we do believe that it's actually a bit of a spot price scarcity due to sort of the growing season for guar, which is primarily grown in India, and when the new crop will become available which should be in the fall, and then we see maybe see some of the scarcity going away. And also obviously, we, like the rest of industry, are looking for alternatives to guar, and we are having some customers accept either lower-grade guar or alternatives to guar that, while maybe not getting the well response they want, at least they are getting something at a cheaper price.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Got you. And do you think -- I mean, I know it's difficult to sort of foreshadow at this juncture. But do you think it's a reasonable expectation to expect that the guar cost inputs in 2013 will probably be less than what they are today?
Mark A. McCollum: Based on everything we know right now, that's a reasonable expectation.
Timothy J. Probert: Yes. I think also, Bill, the fact of the matter is, is that guar substitutes become attractive at a certain guar price. We're at that price right now. So guar substitutes, whether or not that's Halliburton's CleanStim technology, for example, which is certainly a substitute which has been used effectively in a number of basins, including the Eagle Ford, or other substitutes, will become effective and will essentially create some sort of ceiling on the price of guar.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Got you. Second question, I mean, everybody, I guess, justifiably seems to be focused on what's going wrong as opposed to what can go right in a category of what can go right. With regard to the likely uplift in activity, in the Wolfcamp activity, plus a step change increase in service intensity, coupled with the ongoing evolution of the Utica and other plays, how do you think the industry is positioned today from a capacity standpoint to meet that demand, call it, 2 or 3 years down the road?
Timothy J. Probert: Yes, I think a couple of points there, Bill. I think number one, I mean, clearly, the industry has a history of responding to the need. I don't particularly see that as being a primary concern. And so I think that if you take a look at where we are today as we outlined, what we're planning on is a modest single-digit increase in activity through the year. Now that's the basis for the guidance that we provided. And clearly, there is a scenario where we have a significantly increased volume of activity in oil-based plays. If that takes place, then clearly, we have a much more robust outlook than we currently have. But we provided you a scenario based on our best guess, which is [indiscernible].
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Got it. And then last one, you touched on this, but I didn't get a sense as to order of magnitude. Frac of the Future initiatives, one, are they tracking as expected and targeted? And two, when do you expect those to begin to exert a significant impact with regard to your North American profitability?
Timothy J. Probert: So there are a number of elements to Frac of the Future, all aimed at a variety of elements around reduced personnel, reduced capital deployment, et cetera, and improved efficiency. Probably the largest single element of that is the rollout of our Q10 pump, which is now rolling off the line. And we will make that together with our new blending and storage capacities. And we have a deployment plan which will give us the ability to compare very effectively between existing fleets and our new Frac of the Future fleets, so we can get a real good handle on both capital deployment and people deployment. We'll see those roll out during the course of this year, Bill. And towards the end of this year, we'll have a very -- start to see an impact in key basins, where they're deployed.
Mark A. McCollum: I was also going to say at the back-office initiatives, the mobility plans are all designed to roll out late Q2 and Q3, which really means that you're going to see the meaningful part of the impact in 2013.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: And the leaning out of the frac crews, we still expect to see an overall sort of reduction of about 25% on average with regard to the employees attributable to your frac crews?
Mark A. McCollum: Yes, Bill, that's still the target. Part of that will be achieved through the rollout of these new pumps and the blending units and other things that allow us to do less maintenance out on location. The other thing will also be the mobility plan helps us in achieving more of our remote operations initiative, which again will be later in 2013. But in particular areas such as the gas basins, our guys are very focused on leaning out those crews as we speak as the work provides for it. Other places, we're still scrambling as you might imagine, and it's all hands on deck.
Operator: Our final question comes from Doug Becker of the Bank of America.
Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I'll hit the international side a little bit, but it seems like results are off to good start. What do you think the greatest risk to meeting margin expectations in the high teens by the end of the year are? Is it more mobilization? Is it just more pricing, never picking up? How would you characterize that?
Timothy J. Probert: This is Tim. I would say that one of the things that we have collectively been disappointed with is essentially the growth of rig count and growth of activity during the course of the last 12 months. Year-on-year, we're only up about 2% in terms of rig count. So I would say the biggest single risk probably is more around ensuring -- well, I said not that we can ensure it, but it's more around the continued expected progression of rig count through the balance of the year than any other factor. It looks good right now, but we have been disappointed before by the amount of growth.
Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: And it looks like we saw a relatively modest decline in revenue and margin in Europe/Africa/CIS. Is the first quarter a good base for us to be thinking about a bit of a recovery, a seasonal recovery in the second quarter in that market?
Mark A. McCollum: Well, clearly, there'll be seasonal recovery. You have to recall that the weather in Northern Europe on the North Sea was incredibly bad this year, probably worse than it's been in a long time, the exact total opposite from what we experienced in North America. So I think that the seasonal impacts were larger than we had seen in some prior years, which probably is part of what you've seen and maybe missing your potential -- your particular expectation. But I think in that regard then, we should see a better seasonal recovery from some of those areas as we go into Q2 and Q3.
Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: That's what I was getting at. And then just in Latin America, any quantification of what the mobilization might be in the second half? Are we talking 100, 200 basis point drag or something along those lines?
Timothy J. Probert: I think a little too early to say right now. We can provide some additional guidance on the next call.
Kelly Youngblood: Okay, Sean, we're ready to close out the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Halliburton's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Kelly Youngblood, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2011 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days. The press release announcing the fourth quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development. I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release, announcing the fourth quarter results, which, as I have mentioned, can be found on our website. We'll welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. Dave?
David J. Lesar: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning to everyone. Before discussing our fourth quarter results, let me begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2011. First, I'm very proud to say that this was a record year for our company, with revenues of $24.8 billion, operating income of $4.7 billion and with growth, margins and returns that led our peer group. To put this in perspective, our business has nearly doubled in size over the last 5 years, primarily from organic growth. From a division perspective, we achieved record revenues in both our Completion and Production and Drilling and Evaluation divisions, and I want to thank all our employees for their help in making it happen. The cornerstones of our strategy remain unchanged and include maintaining leadership in unconventional plays, participating in the deepwater expansion and impacting the decline curve in mature fields. This year, we commercialized key technologies consistent with these growth themes, and Tim will discuss them later. As the industry leader in unconventional shale plays, we performed the first shale fracs in numerous countries around the globe, including Argentina, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Poland. We are now starting to invest more heavily in building out our pressure pumping footprint in the international marketplace. We are also continuing to invest in our deepwater business and have secured key contract wins in East Africa, Vietnam, Malaysia, Australia, China, Brazil and other markets and are building infrastructure to support this work. In addition, it's important to note that our service quality continues to be recognized by our customers, as Tim will also discuss. We believe this improving market position and service quality reputation will benefit us as new build deepwater rigs are scheduled to arrive in the coming years. Our customers are looking for deepwater alternatives that have the capability and technology, and increasingly, that company is Halliburton. And lastly, we continue to build our capabilities in servicing mature fields and supported that effort with some critical acquisitions in specialty chemicals and artificial lift in 2011 that enabled us to broaden the scope of our mature field offerings to our customers. The most significant of these was Multi-Chem. We expect that synergies and sales, manufacturing and distribution will enable us to deliver additional value to our customers and shareholders as we expand the global footprint of this product line. I'm very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter as we set new company records in both our North America and international operations. Revenues of $7.1 billion represents the highest quarterly revenue in the company's history, with North America, Latin America and the Middle East/Asia regions all achieving new record levels. Operating income of $1.4 billion was also a company record and was driven by strong performance in North America and the Latin America regions, where we had year-over-year revenue growth of 56% and 46%, respectively. Let me start by providing some commentary on North America. The shift from natural gas to liquids-rich plays continues and was quite apparent in the fourth quarter. The U.S. rig count grew 3% sequentially, with oil-directed rigs up 8% and natural gas rigs down 2%. The shift toward oil and liquids-rich plays are a direct result of the stability of higher -- of oil prices and higher operator returns for these resources. Completing these wells requires higher levels of service intensity due to advanced fluid and completion technologies and creates an additional opportunity for us to otherwise differentiate ourselves from the competition. We have highlighted for some time the dramatic impact that oil-directed horizontal activities has had on the North America market. For instance, in addition to natural gas rigs targeting liquids-rich plays, the oil rig count now represents more than 60% of the total in North America, a level we have not seen in decades. Our customers' sources of revenue has also shifted dramatically toward oil, with the sale of U.S. oil and liquids representing approximately 70% of total upstream revenue today. This compares with an approximate 50-50 split just 5 years ago. And our customer mix continues to shift toward IOCs, NOCs and large independents, who tend to have a more stable spending pattern and more sophisticated supply chain management and away from those customers who might be more financially challenged in the current market. We are also seeing a trend toward higher average footage drilled per well, up to approximately 7,000 feet from 5,000 feet just 5 years ago. And finally, today, reserve development demands 4x as much horsepower per rig as compared to 2004. So clearly, there's been a dramatic shift over the past several years, and all of this bodes well for a continuation of high demand in the North America unconventional markets. So what will that market look like going forward? The last time the breakeven price for oil development was so far below prevailing oil prices was back in the early '80s, when the rig count was more than double what it is today. And despite the vast amount of work we've done in North America in recent years, there's only been a modest increase in net oil production, as new supplies are barely offsetting declines for mature North America basins. As a result, we expect continued liquids-driven activity growth in the coming years, as our customers invest in their resources and optimize their development technologies, and we plan to continue to expand our capability and drive efficiency through technology and logistical improvements to enable this growth. Now looking at the results for the fourth quarter. Our North America revenue grew sequentially by 6% versus a 3% rig count due to strong activity in the Eagle Ford, Permian Basin, Marcellus, Gulf of Mexico and Canada. Despite this strong revenue growth, operating income declined slightly from the third quarter. And let me go over those reasons. First, our recent acquisitions and the associated M&A costs that went with them had an impact of approximately one margin point on our North America margins in the fourth quarter. Second, as you know, the Rockies and the Bakken are 2 areas where we have a particularly high market share, and both markets experienced some seasonal impacts yielding inefficiencies, particularly with our commuter crews. The third quarter is historically our most profitable quarter each year in these 2 particular areas, and this year was no different. The impact of the holidays was more pronounced this year in these areas, as customers chose not to compete -- to complete wells through the Christmas holidays. Thirdly, cost inflation continues to have a negative impact. There is a delay between vendor price increases and when we are able to pass through these increases to our customers. In the natural gas basins, this is becoming more difficult, and we plan to go back to our vendors for price relief in some areas. This will take some time. Fourth, logistics and proppant supply. While we have a very sophisticated logistics group, there are times when issues arrive that are not within our control. We experienced logistical and proppant supply disruptions in several areas in the fourth quarter, and this impacted the Bakken, Rockies, South Texas and the Permian, all of which had a negative impact on margins. And finally, we experienced inefficiencies associated with frac fleet relocations to address the challenges the industry is facing in 2012, and I'll say more about that in a few minutes. Also, spot natural gas prices are down 33% in the last 50 days due to the resiliency of natural gas production in a mild winter. In response, we have seen the U.S. natural gas rig count decline 9% over that same period of time, and this change is clearly impacting the industry as we move into 2012, as service companies' resources relocate to the oil basins. Now we've talked in the past about how we believe it is important to have a balanced portfolio of business in both dry natural gas basins and liquids plays because a large number of our customers have operations in both. Our strategy was to support these customers in the natural gas basins with a hyper-efficiency business model that went beyond just 24-hour operations. We stayed with these customers in the natural gas basins even as other competitors left to chase work in the oil plays. This strategy has worked well and deepened our relationship with these customers. Our understanding with them was that in return for staying with them in the natural gas basins, we would get their work in the liquids-rich plays as equipment became available. This strategy is now playing out to our advantage. As natural gas prices are falling to the sub-250 level, we are proactively working with these customers to now serve them in the oil plays as they shift their capital spend to liquids and away from natural gas. We have moved or are in the process of moving 8 frac fleets from primarily natural gas plays to liquids plays. This requires redeployment of people and equipment. It disrupts a very efficient operation, and as well, it is requiring us to make adjustments to our supply chain. It's important to understand that these fleets that are moving are not looking for work but in each case now are committed to an existing customer or one who we could not serve before and, in each case, has or will deplace a competitor in the liquids plays. So while beneficial to us in the long run, these moves do not come out and do not come about without a short-term impact on our margins. First, we lose the productivity of these hyper-efficient 24-hour crews as they move away from locations with a solid infrastructure and a higher level of expertise. Then when they start in a new location, they're not as efficient as they get used to new operating procedures and how the reservoir responds. And finally, there's a doubling up on some costs, as we generally have to use commuter crews while a local crew is changed -- is trained in the new operation. So we believe that these pressures that come from this on revenues and margins will be limited. The additional benefit we get from these moves is that even more of our revenue will be generated in the liquids plays, while we still have the ability to increase prices, which will help to offset inflation pressure. Furthermore, the shift to the oil basins requires more expensive materials, particularly gels and proppants, which are already in tight supply. Additionally, we believe that the movement of service capacity out of the natural gas basins will eventually help remove the overhang in natural gas supply. So with great success, we dealt with a number of these significant logistical challenges in 2011, and we see them being able to accommodate the tremendous growth that we see as we move into 2011, even though it's created some near-term uncertainty and pressure on margins. The concern about what will happen in the dry gas basins is a real one. However, there are customers who will continue to drill in these basins, as they have a low-cost gas basis, a hedge bought before the collapse of pricing or contracts to send their natural gas to markets where the pricing is better. These are our customers, and they will continue to need our services in the natural gas areas. And in most cases, we have a long-term contract with them that value the efficiencies we bring, so they can continue to make money even at lower prices. We have not yet exhausted the demand for fleets that we can relocate to those customers who want our services in the liquids basins, and we will continue to do that as necessary. We have established a great position in the U.S. market. And in these uncertain times, I believe that will pay off big for us. As we look at the market dynamics today and even apply a downside scenario to how it might play out, based on frac equipment adds as well as reduced gas drilling, which would accelerate the equilibrium in the market for pumping, it is clear to us that the strength of liquids demand will provide a cushion to equipment coming out of the dry gas basins. We also believe that there will be a net overall increase in rig count in 2012. Meaning that in our view, the increase in liquids-directed rigs will more than offset the decline in natural gas rigs. We believe a much more pessimistic scenario is currently priced into our stock, and we do not see that happening. In the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to see a gradual increase in activity levels with our fourth quarter revenue surprisingly now exceeding pre-moratorium levels. We believe we will see an increase in the level of permit approvals in 2012, leading to additional deepwater rigs arriving over the next several quarters. Margins for the Gulf are expected to improve but not to pre-moratorium levels until later this year or into next year as our customers adapt to new regulations. So while we expect some inefficiency and, therefore, a downward pressure on margins in the near term due to the shift in our geographic and commodity mix that I just discussed, we believe that the idea that North American margins will collapse is a ridiculous one. We believe increased activity from our customers due to support of liquid prices, good access to capital and continued increases in service intensity are very supportive of a healthy market in 2012. Keep in mind, we have also been spending money on improving our cost structure, as we outlined in our Analyst Day, to stay ahead of the competition. And finally, we remain focused on providing superior service to ensure that we are the provider of choice and to maximize the value for our customers. So overall, we are very optimistic about 2012 and fully expect that North America revenue and operating income will increase over 2011, although we could see margins normalize somewhat through 2012, and we'll have a better view of this absolutely as the year goes on. Now let's turn to our international results. Latin America had another outstanding quarter, posting sequential revenue growth of 9% compared to a rig count decline of 1%, and their operating income grew 24%. Mexico led the growth with higher drilling activity, consulting services and software sales. Also contributing to the stellar quarter was Colombia, with higher drilling activity, and Brazil. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, these 3 countries combined and grew an impressive 50% year-over-year. Our Eastern Hemisphere experienced 11% sequential revenue growth compared to a rig count growth of 3%, while operating margin improved to 13%, driven by year-end sales of software, completion tools and other equipment. Also contributing to the strong quarter were improved results in Iraq, Algeria and East Africa. We continue to show progress in the markets that have been negatively impacting our margins over the past few quarters. For instance, in Iraq, we are running 5 rigs today, 2 more than at the end of the third quarter. We expect to add additional drilling and workover rigs in 2012, which will enable us to be profitable as activity levels increase. Overall, we remain enthusiastic about the future of our Iraq operations despite the challenges we went through in 2011. Libya's production is coming back online, and although we have performed some minor work in the country, we are still awaiting well-defined operational plans from our customers. In Sub-Saharan Africa, we continue to see improvements in Angola and Nigeria. And while startup costs have negatively impacted operating margins in East Africa, we saw overall sequential improvement in this market. And lastly, we've been taking action over the past few quarters to improve profitability in our Europe/Africa/CIS region, and we've made substantial progress in our restructuring efforts and believe we are now well positioned to deliver improved profitability in these markets in 2012. We have been consistent in our outlook for our international operations. We anticipate international pricing will continue to remain competitive, particular in regard to larger projects. In 2012, we expect to see a gradual improvement, resulting from new rigs entering the market and increased customer budgets, which we believe will be skewed toward deepwater and international unconventional projects. With tight supply and demand fundamentals for oil and international natural gas prices that are often well above North America prices, we believe the drivers of the sustained activity in the Eastern Hemisphere are sound. So in summary, we expect to see our Eastern Hemisphere margins progress through 2012, with a full year average in the mid-teens, as new projects ramp up, new technology’s introduced and the negative impact of the areas we've mentioned previously continue to abate, which means that we should have Eastern Hemisphere margins in the mid- to upper teens by the end of the year. We believe that our growth prospects are so strong across all of our businesses that we are increasing our capital spending to the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion in 2012. However, we do not expect to increase our pressure pumping horsepower additions beyond the 2011 levels, and we plan to spend -- to send more of this horsepower into our international markets. But we will, of course, maintain our ability to flex the capital as the year goes forward. So 2011 was a very successful year for the company with revenue growth of 38% and operating income growth of 57%. We saw record activity levels, and we will continue to expand on our market position. I believe we will continue to build on this success, which should put us in the unique position to continue to achieve our objectives of superior growth, margins and returns versus our competitors. I'll let Mark give you a little bit more detail.
Mark A. McCollum: Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide you with our fourth quarter financial highlights. Our revenue in the fourth quarter was $7.1 billion, up 8% sequentially from the third quarter. Total operating income for the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion, up 7% from the previous quarter. Our results in the fourth quarter included a $24 million charge in Corporate and Other related to an environmental matter. As a reminder, our third quarter results included an asset impairment charge of $25 million in the U.K. sector of the North Sea. Now going forward, I'll be comparing our fourth quarter results sequentially to the third quarter of 2011, excluding the impact of these charges. North America revenue grew 6%, while operating income declined 1% compared to the previous quarter. As Dave mentioned, the impact of seasonality, cost inflation and recent acquisitions negatively impacted our North America margins during the quarter. As a reminder, we historically see our first quarter results affected by weather-related seasonality in the Rockies and the Northeast U.S., where we have a high percentage of 24-hour crews, and it's typical to see a sequential revenue and margin decline in the first quarter. In addition, we're expecting some short-term inefficiencies as a result of rigs and equipment moving from natural gas to oil-directed basins. We're anticipating these issues will result in a sequential margin decline of approximately 100 basis points in the first quarter for North America. Internationally, revenue and operating income grew 11% and 37%, respectively, driven by activity improvements across all our regions and seasonal increases in softwares, completion tools and direct equipment sales at the end of the year. Our international margins improved to 15.2%. About half of the margin increase resulted from our seasonal increase in software and direct sales. The other half of the margin increase was driven by activity improvement in our other operations. Now for the first quarter of 2012, we're anticipating the typical sequential decline in international revenue and margins due to the absence of these year-end seasonal activities, as well as the typical weather-related weakness in the North Sea and Eurasia. As a reminder, this international activity decline has historically impacted our first quarter results by approximately $0.10 per share after tax, and we have no reason to believe it will be materially different in 2012. Now I'll highlight the segment results. Completion and Production revenue increased $303 million or 8% due to activity growth in North America, and operating income was essentially flat as improved international profitability offset a slight decline in North America. Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis, North America revenue increased by 7% from higher U.S. land, offshore and Canadian activity. Operating income declined by 2%, primarily due to the holiday downtime, cost inflation, acquisition impacts and fleet moves that Dave described earlier. In Latin America, Completion and Production posted a 5% sequential increase in revenue, while operating income grew by 19% as a result of increased stimulation work in Mexico and higher cementing activity in Colombia and Mexico. In Europe/Africa/CIS, Completion and Production revenue and operating income increased 15% and 10%, respectively, due to improved vessel utilization in the North Sea, increased cementing work in Angola and higher stimulation activity and completion tools sales in Algeria and Nigeria. In Middle East/Asia, Completion and Production revenue and operating income increased by 8% and 4%, respectively, due to increased work in Iraq, improved stimulation activity in Australia and increased direct sales within the region. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased $213 million or 8%, and operating income was up 30% due to the year-end seasonality of higher software and direct sales, as well as higher activity levels in Mexico, Iraq, Colombia, Brazil and East Africa. In North America, Drilling and Evaluation's revenue and operating income were up 4% and 2%, respectively, due to higher wireline and drill bits activity in both the U.S. land and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as increased software sales in the U.S. and Canada. Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income increased by 11% and 27%, respectively, primarily due to higher activity levels in Mexico and increased testing and subsea work in Brazil. We also benefited from strong project management activity in Mexico on the Alliance 2 and Remolino projects. In the Europe/Africa/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income were up 5% and 27%, respectively, due to increased wireline and directional drilling activity across the region, along with the seasonal year-end increase in software sales. Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East/Asia revenue was up 17%, and operating income was almost 1.5x greater than prior quarter levels due to increased direct sales in Asia and higher drilling activity in Iraq. Now let me address some additional financial items. Our Corporate and Other expense included approximately $23 million for continued investment in our initiative to reinvent our service delivery platform in North America and to reposition our supply chain, manufacturing and technology infrastructure to better support our projected international growth. These activities will continue in 2012, and we anticipate the impact of these investments will be approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per share, after tax, in the first quarter. In total, we anticipate that corporate expenses will range between $95 million and $105 million per quarter during 2012. In November 2011, we issued $1 billion of senior notes. This new debt issuance will increase our interest expense by approximately $10 million per quarter, and we're projecting overall interest expense for 2012 to be approximately $75 million per quarter. Our effective tax rate was 33% for the fourth quarter and 32% for the full year. Looking forward, we currently expect the 2012 effective tax rate will be approximately 33% to 34%. And finally, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.6 billion during 2012. Tim?
Timothy J. Probert: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to provide some additional detail on the accomplishments that Dave alluded to and some of the technologies which not only have made a substantial contribution to our success in 2011 but will, we believe, underpin our focus areas for growth in unconventional, deepwater and mature assets in 2012. In the North America unconventional market, we've made great progress in deploying elements of our frac-of-the-future strategic initiative. We're rolling out our first series of Q10 pumps that have demonstrated significant reliability and maintenance advantages in field testing over our current fleet, already generally considered to be the best in the industry. Aggressive deployment of SandCastle storage and advanced dry polymer blenders in 2011 is expected to also provide ongoing improvements in capital efficiency and environmental performance. We've been particularly pleased with the performance of our GEM wireline analysis tool, which offers rapid evaluation of complex petrophysical properties, called "Shale Expert." It's been widely used in unconventional fields in the U.S. and internationally. We introduced our new RapidFrac sliding sleeve system that provides our customers with a dramatic increase in efficiency for the completion of horizontal unconventional reservoirs. We were also the first to deliver a cemented version of this technology. We realized a 10% reduction in crew size this year, and we expect ongoing improvements as we increase remote job monitoring and complete the deployment of our field mobility program, which will deliver enhanced operations and logistics efficiency. So in total, we believe our frac-of-the-future initiative will make us the most cost-effective service provider in the industry. We expect it to be fully rolled out in North America by the end of 2012 and will serve as a platform for our investment in international unconventional growth too. We continue to feel positive about international unconventionals. Customer consulting agreements have given us an opportunity to screen some 150 worldwide unconventional basins and 60 in detail. We are very encouraged by the properties we see in many of these basins and are responding accordingly with capital investment. Drilling on LWD technology deployment moved rapidly in 2011. Geosteering activity to optimally place wellbores in reservoir sections was up 75% year-on-year, driven by unconventional and deepwater activity. Much of this was based on our award-winning ADR deep-reading resistivity technology. Sampling technology while drilling has had a special emphasis for us. Our recent GeoTap IDS run offshore was used to gather over 50 pressure and multiple-reservoir fluid samples during drilling operations; an industry first. This allowed the customer to save over 80 hours of rig time and eliminated the need for a competitor's wireline run. We also set numerous records in high-pressure, high-temperature applications in 2011, both for our wireline and drilling technologies. And we continue to see new wins based on this differentiated technology, as our customers increasingly exploit deeply buried reservoirs. The exciting worldwide launch of DecisionSpace Desktop in 2011 was very well received in the market and contributed to a record profit year for Landmark. Over 1,600 individual licenses were established in the first year, and 46 of our 50 largest customers have either migrated or are in the process of migrating their data to the DecisionSpace platform. Integrated Project Management activities are on a steep upward trajectory. Despite a slow start in Iraq, revenues for our Project Management segment nearly doubled from 2010. We see this as a major growth platform, and the pipeline in 2012 is strengthening notably in mature assets. So while we've been pleased with the growth of the technology portfolio and its ability to underpin our top line and margin growth in 2012, we're also very focused on execution and service quality. We're pleased with our performance this year. For example, Sperry drilling and wireline rates of nonproductive time continue to strengthen by 24% and 26%, respectively, from 2009 to 2011. And we continue to receive positive customer feedback, including a top performance review from a European IOC for formation evaluation. The combination of fit-for-purpose technology with excellent execution provides us a strong foundation for 2012 growth. Dave?
David J. Lesar: Thanks, Tim. So obviously, a lot of moving parts this quarter. Let me summarize what I think should be the takeaways. One, we do not believe that there will be a collapse in margins in pressure pumping in the U.S. Therefore, our revenues and operating income are expected to increase in 2012 in North America. We expect our revenue growth will be in excess of the rig count growth in both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. We expect our deepwater revenue growth will be in excess of the deepwater rig count growth, while we continue to earn from our customers kudos for our distinctive service quality. And although it will have a short-term impact on our margins, we are proactively moving equipment from dry gas basins to liquids plays, and this equipment is immediately displacing competition. We expect our Eastern Hemisphere margins to return to the mid- to high teens by the end of 2012, as we gain traction on new projects and growing our revenue faster than rig count. And lastly, our positive view of the market supports a capital spending of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. But let me reiterate, pressure pumping horsepower additions are not expected to increase over 2011, and we believe more of those will go to the international markets. So let's turn it over to questions at this point.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James West with Barclays Capital.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A quick question on -- so your North American margins, you mentioned another 100 basis points down in 1Q. Do you expect a -- further, I know you don't expect a collapse but a further deterioration as we go into 2Q, 3Q, or is that where we start to stabilize out? And I guess a follow-up to that is kind of what should normalized margins be in North America?
Mark A. McCollum: I think the answer is at this point, James, that it's too early to tell. Obviously, we said in our comments, we look at the gas market's changes right now with some level of concern. But for the time being, most of those rigs are shifting from dry gas to liquids-rich basins. And as long as the rigs continue to shift, then we should be able to shift equipment. And while there might be some temporary margin impact, we should be able to get back to some level of normalized margins once the cost blip passes. But right now, I think it's still a little bit too early to tell.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then can you just, Mark, remind us what kind of contract coverage you have for the pressure pumping equipment you have in North America today and then for the incremental capacity you have coming in this year?
David J. Lesar: Yes, James, this is Dave. All of our equipment that we have out there today and all that we anticipate bringing out in 2012 is already allocated to a specific set of customers. So none of it will be sort of in the open speculative market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Handler with Crédit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I guess I'll stick with North America as well, please. If the -- is there -- and ultimately that sense of where margins can go, if you're positioning assets more in liquids markets, what does -- what implications does that have on 24/7 operations once they're -- once you're doing what you think they should be doing? And maybe just conceptually then, if you have more pricing leverage than you've had in the last 6 months, just talk to us a little bit about where you think sort of the margins can -- let's strip out a couple of things, if you will, but can margins get back to above levels were you saw, say, in the third quarter?
David J. Lesar: Well, I think, obviously, as we -- as they shift into the oil basins, the opportunity to go toward 24-hour operations improves. Right now, activity is still fairly robust in those markets, and there's a clear shortage of people and equipment, as well as some of the supply chain issues that we find. And based on all the reports that we get from our guys in the field, we're continuing to get some pricing improvements in those oil- or liquids-rich basins. The problem, I think, that we face as we look forward is what will inflation do? As Dave commented, we're going to have continued challenges with logistics, with the supply chain moving proppants and gels and other things into those basins because they're in short supply. And we're fighting back inflation as hard as we can. Most of the price increases that I think that we're being able to achieve right now are serving to basically offset that inflation. We're going to have to work hard, as Dave commented, to really push back and see if we can get some relief from some of our suppliers as things soften in the gas basins. But we'll have to continue to work to make sure that we can get all of that passed through with the price increases that we get. So I think, as I've said, it's a little early to comment as to how much we can move pricing on a net basis, nor -- I just can't speculate at this point whether we'll be able to go back and get them back above those levels that we had in Q3 or even higher.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Understood, and I appreciate the color. As a follow-up, related -- coming back to pricing but maybe touching on a couple of things slightly differently, can you comment on price -- your pricing realizations recently in natural -- in dry gas basins? And then actually, can you give us some color on nonfrac-ing pricing in the U.S. as well?
Timothy J. Probert: This is Tim. Clearly, in the dry gas basins, there has been significantly more pressure than there has in liquids basins. I think that one of the things I tried to sort of outline for you here just on the call is a few of the key technologies, which are giving us an opportunity to extract some pricing realization pretty much across the board from drilling evaluation through to -- Drilling and Evaluation through to Completion. So there's leverage, I think, in North America to do that. That's the technology side. And as Dave and others have alluded to, we're also working hard on the cost efficiency side, investing substantially into an effort to lower our cost of delivery. So I think we've got a couple of tools in our chest here to -- in our war chest here to ensure that we minimize the impact of the transfer from dry gas to liquids basins, and then once there, have the tools to make sure that we get value for what we're delivering.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Fair enough. But absent the -- and I'll let others go. Absent the technology opportunity set, in nonfrac-ing-related activity, say, in -- also in liquids-rich basins, for example, are you seeing -- whether it is in coiled tubing or whether it's in your drilling suite, are you seeing pricing opportunities like-for-like products today?
Timothy J. Probert: There are some pricing opportunities. I think completions would be a bright spot. Obviously, with the introduction of RapidFrac, I would say that. And to use a negative example, obviously, as you move out of some of the deeper, hotter dry gas basins like the Haynesville, where high-temperature, high-pressure tools have been under great demand, there's less demand for those in liquids-rich basins. So there's a couple of pluses and minuses for you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Another question on North America. David, seems like one of the reasons for your success in North America is that you've been able to get your customers to take at least 4 other product lines for new frac spreads when you contract with them for frac equipment. Your competition says this will change when things come back into balance. Do you see it changing? Or do you think this can be a somewhat permanent feature of the business?
David J. Lesar: No, I think it's a -- I think it's more of a permanent feature of where we see the market. We were able to use the leverage of the frac fleet and still continue to use the leverage of the frac fleet -- don't get us wrong that we lost it, it's still there -- to bring some of our other product lines along. What we've been able to do is prove to our customers that by integrating those products together, with a frac, either through an integrated completion or integrated drilling, that there's actually a benefit to doing that. And therefore, our customer gets a well down faster, cheaper, more efficiently or more quickly. So I don't see the world going back to that because I think we've been at this long enough to prove the benefit of that strategy out.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: And my follow-up is an international question. And in your opinion, will increased demand alone start to be the catalyst that gets pricing to improve on large tenders? Or will it take a change in mindset by at least one of the major companies in the business?
Mark A. McCollum: I guess our planning assumption at this point is it's going to take an increase in demand overall. I mean, I think that, clearly, there are situations where service quality and technology can come to bear, that might help us in pricing. But our planning assumption is that the competition -- our competition is continuing to price very, very aggressively to prop up their share positions. And so we're continuing to battle hard on that front, and that means that it's in our -- it's our responsibility to execute well and to continue to roll out technologies to make sure that we can improve our margins and improve our returns over time, at least for the foreseeable future.
James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Got it. Okay, Mark, just one more quick one. Your international contracts, if you have a-year-or-2 contracts for your frac equipment, do they have a clause which allows the customers to suggest a lower price to you or to ask for a lower price and you then consider it?
Mark A. McCollum: No. They typically don't have a clause that allows them to consider a lower price. A number of them have clauses that allow them to step away from the contractual arrangement after some period of time, and there are usually some penalties and make-wholes that are associated with that. What we're seeing in a number -- as Dave alluded to, when they begin to shift equipment, there also is a discussion of them shifting the arrangements to continue to work with them as the rigs move to the liquids-rich basins.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: With regard to your Eastern Hemisphere margins or international in general, if we're looking at a $0.10 hit quarter-on-quarter Q1, due to reasons that you mentioned, which are largely seasonal, are we looking then for the balance of the year in order to hit your mid-teens target on the Eastern Hemisphere front for the year up 200 or 300 basis points per quarter as 2012 unfolds at least?
Mark A. McCollum: I don't want to set specific expectations on that, but yes, I mean, I think when you do the math, that's generally how it's going to need to work.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Okay. And then with regard to your deployment of pressure pumping internationally and that's going to outpace the deployment of the domestic -- of assets -- of frac-ing assets in North America, is there -- or so is that international deployment, is it at this juncture trying to capture growth option value? Or is it specifically correlated with project ramps, which you've been contracted for or you're in sort of a specific dialogue with customers?
David J. Lesar: No, I think, Bill, it's really the latter. I think the -- if you look at the spaces that we enumerated, where we've done shale fracs last year, those -- you got to think of those as really exploration plays still. But we are having enough discussions with enough customers in those geographies to indicate to us that the demand will be there for that equipment. And similar to what we saw in the U.S., the demand for additional horsepower to do these shale fracs is there. So typically, where the investment is going is to augment the horsepower that we already have in place in these countries to basically take advantage of and have adequate horsepower on standby to be able to do the larger shale fracs versus maybe conventional work we've done there in the past.
Mark A. McCollum: Hi, Bill. This is Mark. I want to just make sure we correct a statement that you said. We weren't saying in our comments that we're sending more horsepower to international than we are into North America in 2012. We're just sending more than we -- to international than we sent in 2011. Higher percentage, okay?
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Yes, good. And then one more for me. Mark, I'm not sure if you addressed this with regard to your guidance, but corporate expense for 2012, how should we think about that?
Mark A. McCollum: Well, we should run probably in total about $95 million to $105 million per quarter. And we did say in the first quarter, yes, there's going to be $0.02 to $0.03 of -- on an after-tax basis of cost that will be for these corporate initiatives, and that it probably will run in about the $0.02 range for the remainder of the year on an individual quarter. So that's a large part of why the corporate expenses have stepped up on a year-over-year basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I just want to follow up on the international shales as well. A year ago, when I've asked you a question about how many rigs may be working in international shale, I think at that time, the number was maybe in the 10 to 15 kind of range. How has that number changed now in the last 12 months? And where do you expect that number to go in the coming 12 months?
Timothy J. Probert: Waqar, this is Tim, and I'll use an example to sort of maybe help with that, Latin America, which has got quite a lot of opportunities in the combination of Mexico, Colombia and Argentina. And it seems to us that the opportunity continues to grow. In 2012, it sort of feels to us like there's somewhere between 75 and 100 wells which will be drilled for shale activities in Latin America. And just if we put that in perspective with respect to a Haynesville, for example, which is just sort of about 99 rigs or thereabouts at the moment, I mean, clearly, if you divide that -- or multiply that 99 rigs by 3 or, let's say, 4 to 6 wells per year, we're dealing with a significantly smaller opportunity today. But the opportunity is growing and, as David alluded to, we're in the sort of primarily exploration appraisal phase, low horsepower requirements, primarily vertical, now shifting to horizontal, where horsepower requirements are doubling, as well as an increase in activity. So we think 2012 is a pretty good transition year for unconventionals, and we'll see the most significant uptake in '13 and '14.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And now this is just Latin America. How about some of the other markets, Europe or Asia?
Timothy J. Probert: Well, yes, obviously, similar pictures there, too. We're just using Latin America as an example for you, and there are emerging opportunities around the globe. As I alluded to earlier, we’ve had the opportunity to do some basin evaluation work of some 60 basins in detail, and those evaluations are not escaping our customers either. So we're going to see a very positive trend here.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Now would it be fair to say that when pressure pumping trucks were traditionally being employed internationally for, let's say, cementing and maybe acidization [ph] jobs, as they shift to fracturing, the revenue potential per crew could increase maybe 10 to 15x, is that fair to say? Or 10x or so?
Timothy J. Probert: It's not math that I've necessarily done, Waqar. I don’t know that we could say right now. There clearly is a substantial revenue pop. I mean, the difference normally in a horizontal well in the U.S. that's frac-ed versus a conventional well’s almost 2x. So yes, you think about the entire revenue opportunity, it's going to step up quite dramatically if that becomes the norm outside the U.S. as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with UBS.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Dave or Tim, in the liquid basins on pressure pumping, can you give us an idea today of what you're seeing in wait time for frac crews today versus 3 months ago, versus 6 months ago?
Timothy J. Probert: Obviously, we're dealing specifically with the liquids-rich basins here just to sort of to -- obviously, dry gas is different. But I think that we can -- based on the reports from our field guys, we're still very heavily booked through Q1, which is pretty much as far as we ever look out. So that, to us, is a good indication.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then given that you're mobilizing equipment from your gas basins into the liquid basins, I assume others are doing the same. Could we reach a balanced market in the liquids basins earlier than originally expected?
Timothy J. Probert: I think, as Dave alluded to, we continue to expect to see an increase in rig count. And as you have noted yourself, probably our customer base is striving to balance their dry gas and liquids-rich exposure, and we're seeing a significant shift, if you like, from their dry gas element of their portfolio to the liquids element of their portfolio. So it's not just a function of individual customers stopping activity. It's the transference of activity. And also, we tend to get higher service intensity in liquids-rich basins, which, obviously, is beneficial in terms of the overall revenue picture.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Very, very helpful. And finally, just you talked about mobilization and you were talking -- speaking earlier about the cost and logistic issues, and it seems like you're still getting your head around will that continue through Q1 and into Q2 and the time horizon. But at least on the mobilizing of 8 crews from the gassy plays to the liquid plays, when will that be completed by? And from what regions are you moving equipment from? And what regions are you moving it to?
Timothy J. Probert: Well, that will be completed this quarter.
Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay. And then to what region?
David J. Lesar: Into the -- primarily into the Rockies, the Niobrara, the Bakken, the liquids part of the Marcellus and a couple of other areas that maybe haven't hit the radar screen yet.
Operator: Our final question comes from David Anderson with JPMorgan.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Can I just get a little clarity on your capacity additions in North America on pressure pumping? You're just growing at a slower pace in '12, is that -- or is it going to be flat versus '11?
David J. Lesar: Well, the amount of horsepower that we will be producing is going to be flat on a year-over-year basis. There'll be more going into international than we did in 2011, which then means that there will be a fewer amount of horsepower going into North America. The numbers go up on a year-over-year basis because of the manufacturing of the Q10 pump, which is in full production as we speak, and then as well as the addition of other kit to go along with that, the replacement of blenders and the SandCastle and other equipment, that's part and parcel to our frac-of-the-future strategy.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Now should we interpret this as your views that the market is getting closer to being in balance? Or is this just -- or is this somewhat of a reaction to what's happening in natural gas? How should we interpret that?
Timothy J. Probert: I think one of the things that we should respond to there is the fact that, particularly with the Q10 pump and some of our other capital investments that Mark mentioned here, the SandCastle's ADP blenders, et cetera, much more efficient set of assets. And the Q10 pump, in particular, is going to be very substantially more efficient than the current fleet. So we just -- we'll not need to put as many assets into the marketplace to cover the same territory.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And I guess one last question. People have been asking about artificial lift for the last 5 years, and you finally do an acquisition on Global Oilfield Services. Can you talk a little bit about it? Does this fully address your needs in artificial lift? And can you talk a little bit about kind of the strengths of this business and where you think you need to build out more?
Timothy J. Probert: We certainly have talked about artificial lift for a long time, specifically ESPs. And Global is an opportunity for us to enter that segment, for us to extract knowledge and continue to build that business. It's a relatively small business today and one which we have a long horizon on to build its capability and expand it into other areas of artificial lift, but pleased to have it under our belt.
Kelly Youngblood: Okay. Thanks, everybody, for your participation. And Sean, you can go ahead and close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Call [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Kelly Youngblood, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please begin.
Kelly Youngblood: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Third Quarter 2011 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days. The press release announcing the third quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development. I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 and in recent current reports on Form 8-K. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release announcing the third quarter results, which as I have mentioned, can be found on our website. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. Dave?
David J. Lesar: Thank you, Kelly, and good morning, to everyone. I'm very pleased with the overall performance of our business in the third quarter. Total revenues of $6.5 billion and operating income of $1.3 billion are both company records, representing sequential growth of 10% and 15%, respectively. We achieved record revenue levels in our North America, Latin America and Middle East/Asia regions. In North America, revenue and operating income grew sequentially by 13% and 14%, respectively, compared to a U.S. rig count growth of only 6%, and we exceeded $1 billion in operating income for the first time ever. Our international revenue and operating income grew 7% and 23%, respectively, compared to a rig count growth of 2%, driven by a 17% revenue growth in Latin America and more modest growth in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Let me talk about North America in a little more detail. Strong activity in the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian Basin drove the sequential growth for the quarter, along with the seasonal recovery from the Canadian spring breakup. Sequential incremental operating margin for the third quarter was 32%, which was lower than the elevated level we saw in the second quarter. The second quarter was favorably impacted by the typical spring seasonal rebound, as well as very high level of Gulf of Mexico incrementals. Incremental operating margins in the third quarter were negatively influenced by cost increases for materials, logistics and labor. Incremental margins were also negatively impacted by weather stoppages in the Marcellus due to flooding in Pennsylvania and by water shortages in the Mid-Continent, due to drought restrictions. We anticipate continued inflation on various cost items like labor, freight, chemicals and profits, which we plan to offset through targeted pricing improvements. Historically, the pricing offset of these costs may not be realized in every case and can sometimes have a 1- to 2-month lag before cost increases can be fully recovered. Leveraging our market position, serving the customers we cannot get to at this time and the provision of integrated services offerings to customers will be the primary drivers of revenue growth going forward. We also continue to work on efficiency gains and cost structure improvements as outlined in our Analyst Day in November 2010. We are making good progress on the implementation of our frac-of-the-future, for example, and since January we've seen a 10% reduction in our average crew size. So while gas drilling remained basically flat from the second quarter, we continue to believe that there is a risk of decreased gas directed activity. Gas demand for power generation increased this year due to the substitution of natural gas for coal and the harsh summer temperatures we experienced in various regions in the U.S. However, if this demand were to moderate next year, we would expect that the gas rig count could as well. We anticipate that if there is a decline, at least a portion of the rigs would be redeployed to the liquids-rich place. We've already seen this to a degree, as rigs have left the Haynesville for other liquids basins. Such shifts can impact our efficiency and financial performance. In the Gulf of Mexico, we are pleased to see a higher level of permit approval in recent months and we believe more deepwater rigs will be arriving in the Gulf over the next few quarters. While this is a positive trend, we remain cautiously optimistic as we need to see a sustained, higher level of permit applications and approvals to get us back to pre-Macondo activity levels. We believe that our customers now have a better understanding of how the permitting requirements work and this should help expedite the process moving forward. As activity increases, we believe we will continue to benefit, as our share of new deepwater work awards under rigs that are deploying to the Gulf is approaching 40%. This is higher than our typical historical market share. Now let's look at some of our international results. Latin America had a record revenue quarter and posted excellent sequential revenue and operating income growth of 17% and 69%, respectively, compared to a rig count growth of just 5%. Increases in deepwater activity in Brazil, higher drilling activity in software sales in Colombia, and higher consulting and software sales in Mexico were the primary drivers of the strong sequential results. Compared to the third quarter of 2010, these 3 countries grew significantly, with Brazil registering revenue growth approaching 50%. Operationally, the Eastern Hemisphere also improved, but to a lesser degree. The rig count was flat from the second quarter, but we still achieved modest revenue growth. Last quarter, we discussed 5 specific markets that negatively impacted our margins. We still believe the future potential of these markets is well worth any short-term profit impact. Let me give you a quick update on each of these markets. Iraq continues to weigh on our near-term results, but I'm pleased to say that we started operating 3 rigs near the end of the quarter and expect to be at 6 rigs by year-end. We anticipate that we will return to profitability in Iraq in 2012 as activity increases, but we will continue to incur mobilization costs in Q4. We remain enthusiastic about the future potential of our Iraq operations, and despite current challenges, believe it will be one of the fastest growing countries in our operations going forward. The conflict in Libya appears to be winding down, but we continue to lose a significant amount of money each month, maintaining our local workforce and infrastructure. We have sent staff in the country to work with our local team to survey facilities and equipment, and we have already completed a cement job in the past several weeks. I'm happy to report that most of our facilities did not experience any significant damage and we anticipate being operational over the next few quarters. This will obviously depend on how quickly our customers get reestablished and resume work. Restoring our operations in Libya, however, will require us to incur some recovery costs as activity resumes. In Sub-Saharan Africa, we saw improvements in Angola, Congo and Nigeria, while start up costs continued to negatively impact operating margins in Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. As mentioned last quarter, we continue to take action to improve the profitability of our U.K. North Sea. As part of this effort, we incurred some additional restructuring costs in our U.K. operations this quarter by impairing an asset we are now holding for sale. We expect that these restructuring costs will continue in the fourth quarter, but will be completed by the end of the year. And lastly, in Algeria, it appears that the administrative challenges that impacted the industry in the second quarter are slowly showing signs of improvement. Despite a decline in rig count from the second quarter, our revenue and profitability improved sequentially. So our outlook for the international operations remain unchanged. We expect to see a gradual, near-term margin progression as new project activities continue to ramp up. We introduced new technologies and the negative impact of these 5 areas begins to abate. While we have seen pockets of price improvement, international pricing as a whole remains pressured in several key markets where our competitors continue to be quite aggressive in their bidding. With the continuing competitive environment, we do not expect any significant improvement in pricing this year. However, our margins should continue to gradually improve. Now I'll briefly comment on the recent volatility in the equity and commodity markets. While this, of course, has been very unsettling to investors, it has not yet translated into any meaningful changes in customer behavior. We are monitoring our customers' capital spending plans closely, and while they do not cause us any concern at this point, we will respond appropriately to any changes we see. Despite the current uncertainty, these short-term macroeconomic issues have not dampened our enthusiasm for the long-term prospects of our business. In North America, despite the fact that oil and liquids-rich plays have very robust economics, it is likely that some E&Ps who have been outspending their cash flows could reduce their capital spending, especially among those private operators. If this occurs, the industry could see a moderation of growth or even a decrease in rig count. We do not, however, expect to see a dramatic decline like the levels seen in the 2008 downturn. In fact, I believe it's a big mistake to make any direct comparison between recent market events and the 2008 cycle as there are several significant differences. First, North America is now a 2-commodity market for the first time in well over a decade. During the last few cycles, natural gas was a sole driver of activity. Oil and gas have fundamentally different drivers, and today, our customers have developed balanced portfolios that allows them to shift activity as needed. Second, our customers appear to have broad access to the capital markets with record low good interest rates. In the previous cycle, constrained capital halted investment, which in turn caused the abrupt reduction in activity levels. Third is Halliburton's customer mix in North America. We have aligned ourselves with the larger customers who have more stable activity levels and are not as vulnerable to short-term fluctuations in commodity prices. We believe that this strategy will help temper any impact of a potential slowdown to our business. This is partly driven by the reemergence of the IOCs and NOCs into the U.S. land market. Fourth, contract structures in North America now look more and more like those of the international markets. Today, the majority of our equipment and services are tied to long-term utilization-based contracts, where in the past the majority of our work was performed to pricing agreements without volume commitments. The majority of our frac crews for instance are contracted with minimum volume or efficiency commitments through the duration of the contract, and virtually all of our new fleets are deployed with similar contracts. We are currently engaged in discussions with some customers about a new type of contract that gives them more flexibility but assures us of a contracted volume of work and efficiency level. And finally, looking at pressure pumping specifically, there is still a large undersupply of capacity in the market today, due to the continued increase in rig count that is weighted more towards the service-intensive, oil-directed activity. All of these factors provide me with [Audio Gap] and the resiliency of the North American market. However, if activity were to decline, one significant advantage we have over most of our competitors is that we build our own equipment, and therefore, control its flow into the marketplace. If we see the market tightening to any great extent, we would look at immediately curtailing our build program. We also can't forget about the rapidly growing interest and business opportunities in the development of unconventional resources in the international markets. In contrast to North America, international unconventional resources are highly undercapitalized from an equipment standpoint, and we can accelerate and transfer equipment to these international markets. We believe that Halliburton will meaningfully benefit from the emergence of these resources going forward, and Tim will talk about them in a few minutes. The fundamentals of our industry remain very strong. Despite challenges in various economies around the world, the IEA and others forecast energy demand that have only -- have been modestly impacted. Even with relatively high commodity prices over the past few years, leading to increased capital spending, the industry has not invested sufficiently to impact spare production capacity. This suggests that the industry may struggle to keep pace with demand growth in an environment where development of new -- with new resources, continues to grow more technically complex. Our confidence in the near- and long-term future of our business is reflected in our increasing headcount and the number of jobs that we have created in 2011. We are on track to hire 17,000 people into our organization in 2011, about 12,000 of these jobs will be in the United States. In addition to the people already hired, we currently have 5,000 job openings in the U.S. The fact that we are continuing to hire should be an indication to you of our positive view of the continuation of this cycle. So whether we will experience another major global recession is yet to be seen, but I am confident irregardless of the market environment, we are very well-positioned to outperform our competition in growth and returns, just as we did through the last cycle. As always, we will remain focused on delivering superior quality service and bringing technologies to our customers to enable both us and them to achieve their financial goals. Let me turn it over to Mark now.
Mark A. McCollum: Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide you with our third quarter financial highlights. Revenue and operating income grew 10% and 15%, respectively, from the second quarter. Our results in the third quarter included an impairment charge of $25 million on an asset we're holding for sale as a part of our continuing efforts to right size our business in the U.K. sector of the North Sea. As a reminder, our second quarter results included a charge of approximately $11 million in employee separation costs, which is primarily related to our Europe/Africa/CIS region. And I'll be comparing our third quarter results, sequentially, to the second quarter, excluding both the third quarter asset impairment charge and the second quarter employee separation costs. North America revenue and operating income grew 13% and 14%, respectively, well exceeding the U.S. rig count increase, as we continue to benefit from higher activity levels from capacity additions, increases in service intensity and rig additions, particularly in the oil- and liquids-rich basins. We also saw the usual rebound in this quarter from Canada coming out of their seasonal spring breakup. As Dave mentioned, we continue to expect targeted price increases to help offset cost inflation. As in prior years, we expect to see a moderation of our U.S. land results in the fourth quarter, due to the holidays and lower efficiency levels experienced in the winter months, particularly across the Rockies and Northern U.S. And as a reminder, the third quarter has historically been our strongest quarter of the year, so it's typical to see a slight sequential revenue and margin decline in the fourth quarter. For international operations, our outlook is unchanged. We believe that margins will continue to slowly improve from the third quarter levels due to gradual increases in activity. And while we've seen pockets of price increases, we're not anticipating any material upside in international pricing near-term, given recent competitor behavior and the overall negative market sentiment. We expect the usual sequential improvement in the fourth quarter driven by Landmark Software sales, increased Completion Tool deliveries, and direct sales of wireline and other equipment. Typically, international revenues and margins have increased by low-single digits, from the third to the fourth quarter, related to these year-end activities. Similarly, we would then expect to see a sequential decline in international revenues and margins in the first quarter of 2012 as these activities subside, coupled with weather-related seasonality.  In terms of the segment results, Completion and Production revenue increased $407 million or 11%, while operating income grew by 18%. The sequential incremental operating margin for the division was 42%, primarily driven by higher activity in both North America and Latin America. Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis, North America revenue increased by 14%, while operating income grew by 16%, due primarily to higher activity, especially in oil- and liquids-rich basins. Canada's return from the seasonal spring breakup also contributed to the growth. In Latin America, Completion and Production revenue increased 11%, while operating income grew 48% primarily due to higher activity levels in cementing and Completion Tools sales in Brazil, and overall improved activity in Argentina and Trinidad, partially offset by lower pressure pumping activity in Mexico due to contract mobilization cost and vessel drydock repairs. In Europe/Africa/CIS, Completion and Production revenue increased 4% and operating income doubled, as we saw activity increase in our Boots & Coots product line in Norway, Algeria and Azerbaijan, while production enhancement saw increased activity in Angola and Algeria. These increases were partially offset by lower Completion Tools sales in the North Sea and the shutdown in Libya. In the Middle East/Asia region, Completion and Production revenue was flat sequentially while profit grew by 4% as increases in activity in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the United Arab Emirates was partially offset by declines in Oman, Kuwait, Qatar and China. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income increased by 9% and 12%, respectively, led by activity increases in North America and Latin America. In North America, Drilling and Evaluation revenue increased 8% and operating income improved by 3% as the result of Canada coming out of spring breakup and strong directional drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Incremental margins were negatively impacted by the mix of business and some earnings variability associated with some oil and gas properties we are invested in. Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income increased 21% and 81%, respectively, due to higher drilling and fluid services and software sales in Mexico and Colombia, along with increased testing and subsea activity in Brazil. In the Europe/Africa/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue was flat and operating income decreased by 11% due to reduced directional drilling activity in both the North Sea and Egypt, which was partially offset by increased drilling activity in Eurasia, Angola and Nigeria. Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East/Asia revenue was up 9%, while operating income declined 2% as the project delays in Iraq offset improvements from increased activity in Malaysia, improved results on the Ghawar project in Saudi Arabia and some direct sales to China.  Now let me address some additional financial items. Our corporate and other expense ran higher than we've historically experienced. We incurred some additional costs this quarter for legal and some environmental matters. Additionally, we spent about $18 million for continued investment in our initiative to reinvent our service delivery platform in North America and to reposition our supply chain, manufacturing and technology infrastructure to better support our projected international growth. These activities will continue through the fourth quarter and into 2012. And we currently expect the impact of these investments to be about $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter. In addition, we recorded $163 million charge in discontinued operations related to an indemnity provided as a part of our separation from KBR, for work performed by KBR on the Barracuda/Caratinga project. We're pursuing all possible avenues to appeal the ruling, but at this point, we've reserved the full amount awarded by the arbitration panel. The effective tax rate for the third quarter came in just below 33%, which was in line with our guidance. For the fourth quarter, we're projecting that our effective tax rate will be approximately 33%. We'll be presenting our 2012 capital expenditure plan to the board at the end of the year, and therefore, will be waiting for to provide guidance on next year's capital plan until our fourth quarter call. As Dave said earlier, depending on market demand, we can adjust our capital expenditures as needed. Tim?
Timothy J. Probert: Well, thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, we continue to be bullish on the development of unconventional resources outside North America. We've reported, previously, on exploration and appraisal activities but the pace of transfer of our technology and capabilities from North America is now more aggressively underway. For example, we've just completed the first multistage horizontal shale well for Apache in Argentina. Ongoing unconventional operations are also underway in Poland, Australia, Mexico and Saudi. We're in the process of mobilizing horsepower to our Europe/Africa/CIS, Middle East/Asia and Latin America regions in support of these developments.  Dave also commented on the outstanding growth in Brazil in the third quarter. This underscores our evolving strength in the deepwater segment. With 51 new deepwater rigs scheduled to arrive between now and the end of 2013, we've continued to build infrastructure to support recent wins. Not just in the Golden Triangle, but in emerging frontier markets, with 4 new basins supporting deepwater in East and West Africa, Tanzania, Mozambique, Ivory Coast and Ghana scheduled for completion in the coming quarters. We've also spoken to you about our mature asset strategy and our focus on growth and technology positioning in this segment. The recently closed acquisition of Multi-Chem, a leading provider of oilfield production and completion chemicals, is a key step forward in this effort. Multi-Chem has experienced tremendous growth over the last decade and we're excited to have them as part of the team. As the reservoirs we work in become more complex and improved recovery factors are a stronger focus, our comprehensive approach to production optimization will help us deliver improved well productivity to our customers. Dave?
David J. Lesar: Thanks, Tim. Just a quick summary then. Despite the turmoil in the equity markets, we continue to have confidence in our North America business. And there are key differences in both the market and our business compared to prior cycles. Two, pricing in international markets remains competitive, but we expect that our results will continue to show gradual improvement as a result of volume increases. And 3, we remain focused on the high-growth markets of deepwater, unconventionals and mature assets to enable continued delivery of strong financial results. So with that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brad Handler with Credit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Could you please speak to -- I guess let's -- maybe let's just stick with the quarter in terms of my questioning. Just speak a little bit more to the North American Drilling and Evaluation results, if you would. You mentioned mix and a little bit of variability in your oil and gas properties, but maybe you can help us quantify kind of the impact in the Gulf of Mexico. I'm just trying to get a sense for that operating income results and then try to bleed through for what it may or may not mean for the fourth quarter.
Mark A. McCollum: Okay, Brad, this is Mark. I think -- we're going to not probably get too granular on it. But I think if you think in terms of the Gulf of Mexico, obviously, we had very strong incrementals in the second quarter from the Gulf of Mexico, driven by sort of a return or a large surge in activity between Q1 and Q2. Between Q2 and Q3, not as many rigs came into the market, the margins are already there are fairly strong, and so the incrementals weren't quite as large. But from Drilling and Evaluations results from the Gulf of Mexico, they are actually quite good. We talked about the variability of earnings from some of the oil and gas properties. That was a big factor in the quarter. We do make investments with certain strategic customers and certain strategic properties in a way to not only learn the reservoirs but also test new technologies and techniques, and there are some costs associated with that. If you pulled that out of the numbers, D&E's would have been double-digit in the quarter. The incrementals would have been double-digit. They wouldn't have been as high as C&P's incrementals but they would have been quite nice. Hopefully that helps you.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Yes. No, that does help. Maybe as far as a follow up, maybe I'll just stick with the notion of the third quarter impacts and let people pursue the future. But could you give us a feel for -- I was just a little surprised at some of the commentary about, for example, Libya being an incrementally worse impact and perhaps Iraq, things got incrementally worse as well. Could you go through the problem countries in the quarter and just suggest -- whereas a couple of the sub-Saharan countries look like they got better. But if you could just identify for us, where was there sequential decline still in the Eastern Hemisphere in the third quarter and a little bit of the drivers behind that?
David J. Lesar: I think, looking at -- I don't believe that we -- if you took away that we were saying that Libya was incrementally worse or any of these other markets were incrementally worse, I wouldn't necessarily say that. Probably the one that might have been a little bit deeper was Iraq and that's only because -- with the rigs coming in there, there was more cost, as we mobilized for that activity start up this quarter. But otherwise, I think we're making progress in each of those markets. Algeria was better, Sub-Saharan Africa was better, Libya was no worse, and I think even the U.K. sector, the North Sea, was kind of in line with where it was in the previous quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons and Company.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: Mark, a question for you here with regard to -- what I'm trying to understand here is, there was quite a few moving parts with regard to Marcellus and Mid-Con waters, shortages, et cetera. I'm trying to get to sort of an understanding of normalized North America and incrementals. Dave touched on some of the constraints, not necessarily constraints on a structural basis, but timing issues with regard to passing through cost inflation items, chemical fuel proppants, et cetera. How should we think about normalized incrementals going forward? Had been thinking about those in the 40% to 45% range with regard to your volumetric incrementals plus some ability to capture net pricing. Is that still the way to think about it going forward?
Mark A. McCollum: Well, I don't want to provide too much guidance on this one. I think that your averages on incrementals seems high. The way that I would normally think about it is, when you have capacity additions, those capacity additions come in at the variable margin, which essentially approximates what our gross margin would be, which is probably in the high 30s. But as Dave indicated, we always have working against that delays and the ability to pass through some incremental cost related to increases in chemicals and proppants and other things which, this quarter alone, probably increased in the high-single digits, as well as labor. So we're constantly working against that. And of course, the other factor which I think you're beginning to see with this significant increase that we've seen in 24-hour operations across the U.S. and being essentially sold out and fully utilized, anytime you have any delay whatsoever, whether it's weather-related or the availability of water or a customer delay because their schedule changes a little bit, it has a incrementally negative impact on the margins. And I think that's what you're seeing, experienced. I mean, we're certainly still being able to get price increases to cover cost inflation and our equipment rolling out is going out at higher pricing, then as we re-contract new equipment, it's just not the ability to drive significant net pricing increases, it's probably more muted today than it has been.
William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division: And then Dave, with regard to international pricing, I must say you've been consistent, probably more consistent than any of your peers from day 1, with regard to how international has unfolded, and consistent with regard to your prognosis of pricing and you continue to express that international pricing remains very competitive. Can you amplify on that? Where is it competitive? Is it predominantly deepwater? And what's your prognosis for anything on the improvement front?
David J. Lesar: Well, I think we have been, I would say, very pragmatic about where international pricing is. We live in that world every day, so I see the tender results. And we tried to call it like we see it. I would say that the way to think about international pricing, if it's deepwater or if it's a big project or if it's a multiple year project, then it is very, very competitive today. And so I think, as opposed to -- look across the world geographically, I think if it falls into one of those buckets, it's going to be very sought after and very competitively bid. So I think that as more projects start, and there are a lot of projects on the drawing board that are moving toward being sanctioned, that will absorb some of the capacity that's out there. I think that the pressure to bring margins internationally up, sort of being applied by the management so the various service companies will start to create a bias toward higher pricing. And I think just the general overall, more positive economic outlook, will get people feeling better about their businesses. So at this point in time, like I said, it's still very competitive out there, and I expect that folks' margins, albeit moving up, will move up relatively slowly.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wonder if you could give us some color on what is likely to move the needle for you if you look at Middle East/Asia region on one hand or Europe, West Africa, North Africa on the other hand. I mean, how big of a deal is, let's say the drag of Iraq and what's going on in North Africa? And is the key thing to get these things behind us before we can see a similar kind of progress to what you're now making in Latin America or is this the companies like BP becoming more active again and pulling volumes through? Or how should we think about kind of the big factors that will impact your margins in those 2 regions?
Timothy J. Probert: Let me address Middle East. I think there are couple of things. First thing I'd say is that we, obviously, have been talking about activity increases in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi for some time. So the announcement has been made for some time. But the reality is, is that turning that into activity is only just now starting. So, for example here at the end of the quarter, underneath we're running on 2 rigs, and we won't be up full strength probably until the end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter next year. So I think just sort of thinking about the timing of some of these events would be -- is helpful and we certainly see some activity increases coming, which we like and we feel very positively about. With respect to Iraq, it certainly has weighed heavily on our results. Great potential, I don't think anyone disputes that fact, Ole. But the fact of the matter is there are challenges and have been challenges in terms of getting things up and running on a timely basis for a variety of reasons. And at the end of the quarter, we are operating on 3 rigs. We expect to be operating on 6 rigs by the end of the year, at the end of the fourth quarter, and we will see more activity in 2012. So it's really a question of timing and as I think was mentioned earlier, we've always been fairly pragmatic about it. But we do see these changes being very positive for us as we move into 2012.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: So on the Middle East, just seeing big volume increase in areas like Saudi, and Iraq cleared off but -- not yet at least, starting to happen though. But I'm sensing from some of your competitors, let's say that some of the work that they bid in Iraq was bid at a very tough time of the international cycle and that you sort of need to -- to what extent do the industry need to work through contract that are signed at the bad point in the cycle before you can see real improvement in margins?
Timothy J. Probert: So Ole, I use -- I'm sorry, just to sort of make sure I'm responsive to your question there. I mean, you're saying that -- you're asking the question around the timing of the bidding process and what it means in terms of delivering the targets?
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Yes, I'm asking whether there is a backlog of work that needs to exit the portfolio before margins can move meaningfully higher or whether it's just simply getting going?
Timothy J. Probert: I think it's a combination of both in Iraq, to be honest with you. I think that, clearly, there were some aggressive bids in place, to get up and running, get established, and to really get a better understanding of cost and how efficiencies can be driven in Iraq. And clearly, I think, we're all learning how to do that in Iraq. So I think there's scope for margin improvement, both in terms of the existing portfolio of contracts and also obviously, with the increased training of Iraqis, the lowering of overall cost infrastructure, the ability to generate improved margins, arguably at a slightly lower price on contracts in the future.
David J. Lesar: Let me also remind folks, the nature of some of the contracts that we were awarded had a fairly high component of infrastructure investment that we were responsible for, as well as drilling, because they were greenfield projects. Those are pass-through revenues for us, which we have to record on a gross basis. We record the revenues and the costs, and essentially our margin in the deal relates to our management of the process which is a lower margin. But it's a very, very high return because we're not having to make the investment itself in the capital equipment. And so while it reflects a lower margin for the project itself, as these projects move on, they have a very, very high return component. And as, particularly, we move into the product service line work that we will provide, that those are bid at normalized or close to normalized margins, which are very good returns for us.
Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Yes. And on Europe and North Africa or Northwest Africa, what is the key there to getting margins up?
Timothy J. Probert: I think we talked about the U.K. sector of the North Sea, and at some length, not going to belabor that particular point. I think as we all know, and particularly in West Africa, activity levels have been a little slow to return to Angola as it relates to rig count. That's coming up nicely. I think as we referred to, in the call here, we're installing 4 new bases which we've been incurring costs over the course of the last quarter or so, to support deepwater operations, for work that we won in both East and West Africa. That's stuff that really moves the needle for us. And of course, notwithstanding all of that, we will see some stabilization, we're confident in Libya, over the course of the next 2 quarters. Security's still pretty rough in the West, but as things stabilize, we clearly have almost like a Gulf of Mexico type opportunity there because we're still incurring a significant cost, we have nothing to leverage that against at this point. But when we do -- the incrementals obviously will be very positive.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Mark, could you talk a little bit about Latin America, where software sales were cited a couple of times as contributing to margin strength. Is that something we're going to see back off the next quarter? Just curious how you think about the sustainability of the Q3 profit levels.
Mark A. McCollum: Actually, Landmark's profits are actually a bit lumpy, but the fourth quarter of each year is always their best quarter. Just in the normal customer budgetary cycle, we always see a surge in software and consulting sales as they approach the end of the year, buying license agreements and things of that nature. So we do expect -- if you recall last quarter, we mentioned even on the call, that Latin America's margins had been impacted in Q2 by a couple of one-off events in Argentina and Colombia which did not recur this quarter. And so, we saw not only just an increase in overall activity levels, but a jump to sort of our normalized margins. And so as we look ahead, I think that we do feel that these margins are sustainable. There'll be some seasonality as we go into Q1, but at least for the next quarter, in Q4, we feel pretty good about where they stand right now.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: And my second question. Can you just talk qualitatively about the trend you see in the North America business for both 24-hour operations and integrated services? Kind of where are you, as a rough percentage, of total crews out in the field being appropriately [ph] your 24-hours, your integrated services and how has that trended over the last 6 months?
Timothy J. Probert: We're well over 50% in terms of 24-hour crews in North America. And I think that we've done a very good job in getting to that point. We'll continue to push that up. What is the natural sort of endpoint for that, not really sure, somewhere above 50%, somewhere below 75%. So that's, I think, an expectation you can look at. So we continue to push that. And Jeff, what was your other -- second part of your question?
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division: Same question for integrated services.
Timothy J. Probert: Integrated services, obviously, we -- I guess the thing that I would say is changing about integrated services is that I think that it was said, sometimes with the right smile, that we were in a great position to push integrated services because we had some leverage from -- particularly from pressure pumping. In some cases, from Drilling and Evaluation, but mainly from pressure pumping. But I think the reality is today, that whilst we continue to do an increasing amount of integrated services the response from of our customer base is incrementally positive about the benefits that they're seeing. So what I think we're doing right now is seeing a shift from perhaps, shall I say, contracted-led integrated projects to those projects by which the customers are really seeing some incremental value. That's very positive, because what it means is it will be -- it's a sustainable model which will prevail over any ups and downs in the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Maybe this one's for Tim. Tim, Schlumberger said, at one of our events recently, that there's now some element of performance-based pricing on some 40% or more of integrated and rotary steerable jobs. Can we get your sense on performance-based pricing? How you see it as a differentiator and maybe how much of your work it might account for in those areas?
Timothy J. Probert: Jim, performance-based pricing has been around for, obviously, a long time. Both in terms of using motors or rotary steerables or any kind of drilling technology. It's an important tool in our toolkit. I'm not going to disclose what percentage of our contracts are under some sort of performance arrangement, but quite a few. And really, what the issue is, is you've got to have the confidence, obviously, in these positions to able to stand by your ability to drill a certain footage in a certain time, and we're very confident to do that. We believe we've got the technology to stand behind those kind of commitments, and obviously then, generate the returns and the margins that we need as a company. So yes, it's an important trend. I think, Jim, in general, I would say that we would expect to see greater degrees of performance-related contracting going forward than we have as we kind of look back into the rearview mirror.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And second one, just a follow-up for Mark. Mark, I understand some of the contract position of your U.S. fracturing business. But could you characterize what you think are supply/demand conditions in some of the most important domestic basins in the supply/demand and what you see as the trend in spot prices for frac-ing today?
David J. Lesar: Jim, let me take that one, if you don't mind. Bakken undersupplied; Eagle Ford, undersupplied; Permian, undersupplied; Marcellus, undersupplied; Haynesville, probably oversupplied; Mid-Con, gas, dry gas, probably oversupplied; and Rocky Mountain dry gas, probably at neutral.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division: So, Dave, you hear these, I'm sure you've heard these stories about companies' pricing maybe at small discounts, take it in to range research or Carizzo's, business of in the Marcellus and Goodrich claiming lower frac prices in the Eagle Ford. As far as you're concerned, you really just see these as competitive situations and not really indicative of any sort of balancing or softness in the market?
David J. Lesar: No, absolutely not, Jim. We hear about these things anecdotally and try to turn the anecdote into what are the facts. And in many cases, it's a small, pumping-only service company that has a frac spread that's been cut loose by some other customer and they're going around looking for work. That's one situation you run into. Another is when a company that has decided to take a crew from the spot market to the contract market, typically, you do give a discount if a customer is willing to tie it up for a longer period of time at a guaranteed level of efficiency. And I think, so a lot of what we are seeing is spot-to-contract market or the one-off frac crew that's been cut loose and is just looking for a new home. But in general, no. The customer base we're looking at, and the people that want to use our equipment, we're just not seeing any softening in pricing at all.
Operator: Our next question comes from James West with Barclays Capital.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A quick question about your CapEx, as we think about for 2012. And, Mark, understand that you may not want to talk about the overall size of the budget. But how are you guys thinking about the allocation between North America, where it seems like we still have a pretty robust market, for at least the near term, and in international where volumes are growing. And I know Tim talked about and Dave talked about you're undercapitalized on conventional resources internationally. So how are you guys thinking about the difference between those 2 markets?
Mark A. McCollum: No, James, I think that's fine to answer. Just sort of a reminder, really until this past year, over the last 5 years or so, we had biased our capital spend toward international markets, particularly the Eastern Hemisphere as we were growing our business. And we're talking about shades of -- it's not 90-10, it's been more like 55-45, or 60-40, depending on where, what projects we were invested in. This past year that bias had shifted toward the U.S. As we look ahead to 2012, and it really appears to us right now that we are going to be biasing our spend towards the Eastern Hemisphere again. We do anticipate international growth will be coming, particularly as Dave alluded to, for pressure pumping as we begin to focus on unconventional resource development in earnest. Also, with regard to deepwater spend and some of the activities there for the work that we will do. So as we're thinking about it today, it's going to be internationally flavored. The least a majority of it will be and I would say with a bias toward Eastern Hemisphere. We're maintaining flexibility and of course, being an integrated manufacturer of the significant portion of our equipment, that gives us a lot of flexibility.
James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Sure, fair enough. And is the I guess the bias of the overall budget higher or lower, compared to this year?
Mark A. McCollum: It's not going to be any less than this year, I think. But the question is, do we maintain a line? We have been -- continued to operate within our cash flows, being very return focused, and you're not going to see us abandoning that return and the balancing growth and returns focus that we've maintained as we go into '12.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just a question about your customers in North America. Are they talking about their 2012 plan right now or is it a little bit too early? Are they just kind of focusing on where the oil price is at the end of the year? Obviously, they're going to have their -- oil production is coming up quite a bit. This isn't a credit crisis like you mentioned. I'm just trying to get a sense as to where you think upstream spending, North America, is going to be. Do you see it being up next year, I guess, is the question. And I guess, secondarily, is it basically oil price driven?
Timothy J. Probert: A couple of things. I think, first of all, our customers are obviously in the evaluation phase for their 2012 budgets right now. We're monitoring those very closely, Dave, so we can kind of get as much insight as we can into what they plan to do. There are a couple of, sort of, themes which seems to be running around. Obviously, one theme is the introduction of fresh capital from outside, which is still continuing, we're seeing that to happen. Secondly is the relative balance between drill bit spend and also land acquisition. That seems to be shifting in terms of, probably, a greater allocation towards a drill bit in 2012 and away from land acquisition, at least that's sort of the early returns from some of the inquiries that we've had. And I guess, that based on what we see today, I would say that spend next year in terms of drill bit spend, not necessarily overall CapEx, but drill bit spend, looks to be up. But, obviously, we're going to be monitoring that very carefully between now and the end of the year.
John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then just to dig in a little bit more on your CapEx side, but let me just focus on North America. You talked about your flexibility and your ability -- you're manufacturing yourselves so you can move things around. I guess a couple of questions on that. Have you shifted that spending mix from first half to second half yet? I mean, Mark, you've often talked about investing countercyclically in North America. So I guess what I'm wondering is, are you guys already shifting kind of that spend kind of away from new additions right now? And I guess, secondarily, are you starting to see that more broadly in the market? Everybody's worried about overcapacity in the market, but it seems to me that it's very possible you could see capacity additions slowdown 6 to 12 months from out. Can you talk about that a little bit?
David J. Lesar: Yes, Dave, this is Dave. Let me handle that one again. And the answer to your question, the first part of the question is, yes. We have, in fact, biased our additions outside of the U.S. in the back half of this year. And as I travel the world, there hardly is any place I go today that isn't asking for more horsepower. So we've been able to satisfy the horsepower needs and the horsepower requests by shifting some of our production and sending it into the Eastern Hemisphere markets. Because we're not going to end up in a situation where we don't have the horsepower that's needed in a location at the time that the customers are going to need it to drill the wells or complete the wells. And so that part of it is true. And the second part of your question, with regard to people sort of slowing down, I know what we do and we got basically a volume knob in our production and so we can turn it up, we can turn it down as fast as we can. I think a lot of our competitors, because they have got to put orders in and have long lead times on those, I'm not sure that they can slow it down as fast -- certainly, can't slow it down as fast as we can. But I think that everybody's watching the market, and if the returns, the extraordinary returns we're getting today start to moderate a bit for some of those companies, I suspect that there will be less equipment coming into the market.
Operator: Our final question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: You highlight some of the cost inflation that you're seeing in North America at the same time you're making progress in the efficiency gains and the cost structure improvements. Is it realistic to keep North American margins flat? Maybe with some quarter-to-quarter volatility in the flat rigs count environment in North America.
David J. Lesar: Yes. I think that it depends on whether you're asking short-term or long-term. Obviously, we're coming into the winter months now, and so I think it's important to sort of separate the dynamics of the U.S. market into a couple of buckets. One, if you look at sort of how these cycles play out historically, you have good pricing power for a period of time. You run your margins up and then your input costs start to catch up with you and then you are in, essentially, a leapfrog game. Your labor goes up, your chemicals go up, your inputs go up, and then you turn around and you get those recovered from your customers. Not, as I said, on a one-for-one basis and not always immediately, and then you sort of reach another plateau and then you move on from there. So and then I think we had sort of the one-offs in Q3, of the weather-related items. We will have weather items. I'm not predicting where winter is going to go, other than we are starting to work in more Northern climes, the Marcellus and the Bakken for instance. But at the end of the day, I like the position that we have in North America. If you look at the fact that it is continuing to, much more, bias right now toward a liquids type of a market. And then don't forget that we've got -- the goal out there is our frac-of-the-future. We're reinventing our service platform. I think that, as Mark has indicated, we're spending $0.02 or $0.02-plus a share per quarter, reinventing how we are going to go to market in the U.S. Now that isn't going to pay off for a couple of years. But you take that reinvention of the platform, you take frac-of-the-future, both of which we're making good progress on, and I think any market that gets thrown at us we will do as good as, if not better, than any of our competitors.
Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Fair enough. And actually, you mentioned the reinvention. Just how far along in the process would you say you are? I know costs will continue into 2012, but just how far along are we?
David J. Lesar: I'd say we're probably less than 1/3 of the way into it at this point.
Kelly Youngblood: So before we close, we'd like to announce that our fourth quarter earnings call will be held on Monday, January 23 at 8:00 a.m. Central, 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Sean, you can ahead and close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the conference, you may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Halliburton's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Christian Garcia, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please begin.
Christian Garcia: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton's Second Quarter 2011 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days. The press release announcing the second quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development. I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release announcing the second quarter results, which can be found on our website. Dave?
David Lesar: Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with the overall performance of our business in the second quarter. Total revenues of $5.9 billion, which was a new company record, represents 12% growth sequentially. Our operating income grew 43% sequentially, with our North American and international businesses both registering double-digit growth rates. North America continued to experience strong margin growth while our international business saw a modest seasonal recovery from the first quarter.  Against prior year, revenue and operating income grew 35% and 52%, respectively, with operating income more than doubling in North America. International revenue surged 9% against the rig count growth of 5%, while operating income declined from prior year level due to the disruptions caused by the turmoil in North Africa and international pricing deterioration.  We are now seeing evidence that the international pricing is stabilizing. We believe that steady volume increases should be a precursor for overall international pricing to improve toward the end of the year. We also believe that continued execution of our strategies will lead to margin expansion in both our North America and international businesses and provide us with continued overall strong performance for the remainder of 2011 and beyond. Let me now discuss our operating results in more detail, starting with North America. North America experienced sequential revenue and operating income growth of 16% and 36% in the second quarter compared to a U.S. rig count growth of just 6%. We achieved these results despite weather-related issues in the Bakken and high decrementals we get from the Canadian spring breakup. Sequential incremental operating margin for the quarter was 57%, which is the highest level since the start of the North American recovery in the third quarter of 2009. More importantly, for the first time in many years, incremental margins were consistent between our C&P and D&E divisions, evidence of the continued adoption of our integrated services offerings and that all of our well construction-related PSLs are benefiting from this strong market. Overall, growth in the demand for our services has outpaced capacity additions, and we expect this imbalance to continue going forward. We have always been confident in the strength of this North American cycle even when others have not been, and our results this quarter validate our bullish view of the market. The continued shift to oil and liquids-rich activities has propelled sustained volume growth in our U.S. land business. Even gas drilling, which was down only 2% in the quarter, remained relatively resilient, spurred by the increased demand for power generation due to substitution of natural gas for coal and harsh summer temperatures in various regions. Last year, we discussed the strategy of staying with our dry gas basin customers and not moving equipment elsewhere, and to work with them to find a business model that allowed both of us to achieve our financial goals by driving project efficiencies in the high-quality portions of their gas portfolios. While we did sacrifice some margin opportunities at that time, and some of you were critical of that, I believe the strategy is starting to pay off. Our customers are seeing the returns they need, and we are now seeing only a small difference in operating margin between the gas plays and our liquids-rich shale plays. Despite the success, we remain a bit cautious on natural gas drilling for the rest of the year. We continue to believe, however, that any further curtailment would be outweighed by continued expansion in liquids activity. The changing landscape in North America and the corresponding increase in service intensity are playing to our strengths. Operators are drilling longer laterals that require more complex completions to maximize production. In this regard, we are pleased to announce that we have introduced a great new product for our customers called RapidFrac. We believe RapidFrac is now the best sliding sleeve completion system in the market for horizontal wellbores. RapidFrac technology allows for accurate and efficient stimulation, but most importantly, gives our customers enhanced reservoir contact. RapidFrac is being introduced first in the Bakken with outstanding results. One operator, for instance, experienced a 75% increase in production with a 50% reduction in pumping time compared to an offset well using traditional plug and perforate design. This customer is now looking at switching all of their completion work to using RapidFrac. In addition to this technology, we continue to develop innovations that improve reservoir connectivity to enhance production, and Tim will talk about these in a few minutes. We believe the commercialization of these innovative offerings will continue to enable us to sustain our North America leadership position. Activity in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is continuing to recover due to the resumption of the issuance of permits that took place earlier this year. Current approved permits are heavily weighted towards larger operators, which have traditionally been our core customers. We experienced strong incrementals in the second quarter and are currently delivering drilling and completion services at a market share level that is higher than our historical Gulf activity, including providing cementing services for 8 of the 18 new well permits. While we are pleased with the Gulf of Mexico improvement in the second quarter, the pace of permit issuance has slowed again and the fact that some of the initially permitted wells are nearing completion creates a risk that the Gulf recovery could slow or stall in the second half of 2011. As a result, we don't expect to generate the same level of incrementals from the Gulf of Mexico in the third quarter.  Through 2011, we expect that land activity will remain robust as operators continue to pursue an increase in activity for the liquids portion of their asset portfolios. We believe that we will continue to generate margin expansion, but it will be slowed down by general cost inflation, particularly for labor, chemicals and profits. Now let me talk about our international business for a few minutes. Latin America posted good sequential revenue growth from increased activity across most of the region. But margins were impacted by some unusual costs in Argentina and Colombia. Brazil continues to be a stellar performer in the region with a 21% sequential revenue growth from the first quarter, with improving margins. Due to the rapid growth in our Brazil business over the last several years, we expect Brazil operations should soon surpass Mexico as our largest operation in Latin America. We continue to strengthen our presence in the country and are very pleased with our role in assisting our customers in unlocking the value of their deepwater assets. Mexico had a good quarter, with revenues growing 12% sequentially and there are emerging signs that prospects in the country may be improving. But at this point, it is still too early to say whether this performance will be sustainable. Increased interest from our customer to work on their offshore fields and continuing work on the shale plays in North Mexico are contributing to a more positive view of this market over time.  Now let's turn to the Eastern Hemisphere. I am actually quite pleased with where we are in the Eastern Hemisphere. We experienced a modest recovery in our Eastern Hemisphere business as the seasonal rebound from harsh weather conditions in Russia, North Sea and Australia offset disruptions in some markets. We have been growing our Eastern Hemisphere revenue faster than the market and our revenue per rate has increased. We currently have 5 specific areas that are pulling our Eastern Hemisphere margins down. Other than these areas, our margins would be where we would all expect them to be at this point in their recovery.  Let me talk about these 5 areas. First is Libya. We are completely shut down in Libya, but we have maintained our local employee base and the related ongoing expenses all subject to applicable law, pending the outcome of the turmoil. Iraq continues to weigh on our near-term results. As we mentioned in the first quarter, our work in Iraq has shifted from workover to new drilling, but rig mobilization delays and our project start-ups have led to significant underabsorption of our fixed costs. We continue to believe that these drilling projects will commence later in the third quarter when we expect to have 7 rigs running compared to 0 today. Currently, we believe that we will return to profitability by the fourth quarter when the performance of these contracts should be in full swing. Even though these contract delays have impacted our short-term results, they have not dampened our enthusiasm for Iraq. We believe that Iraq will be one of the fastest-growing countries internationally in the coming years and that we will benefit significantly as a result of a first-mover strategy. In Sub-Saharan Africa, we have been successful at winning contracts in both east and west Africa in the past several years. In many cases, these contracts have been in countries new to Halliburton such as Uganda, Tanzania and Mozambique, where I've included the introduction of some of our Drilling and Evaluation product lines to some of our existing countries of operation. As you know, it is expensive to set up new drilling, logging or fluid operations. These new deployments are requiring heavy investment in new facilities in mobilization of equipment and people and are negatively impacting our Eastern Hemisphere margins while these mobilizations are being implemented. However, we believe these new areas of work should position us for many years of profitable operations going forward. Our U.K. North Sea operations are suffering from a lack of customer drilling commitment to that market because of U.K. tax reform policies. We have a large fixed cost structure to our operation in the U.K. and business is not currently at a level that will absorb these costs. We are now in the process of redeploying equipment and people to other parts of the Eastern Hemisphere. And finally, Algeria, we continue to have administrative procedures relating to contract renewals and new awards that are unpredictable and have impacted our level of profitability there. While the timing is uncertain, we expect the issues in Algeria to be resolved, allowing this market to recover. As such, we have made cost structure adjustments primarily in our Europe/Africa/CIS region, resulting in employee separation costs that impacted our results by $0.01 in the second quarter. In total, the issues related to these 5 areas had an impact of approximately 400 basis points on our Eastern Hemisphere margins. We are going to stay the course in these markets as I believe the future upside is well worth it despite the current downside pressure it puts on the margins. There have also been numerous discussions in the investment community regarding international pricing. Our pricing strategy has supported our overall objective of gaining share in certain deepwater markets during the downturn. We won contracts in key geographies by deploying fit-for-purpose technologies and leveraging our customers' need to have multiple providers for their projects. Specifically, we are currently mobilizing PSLs for 31 new projects, 18 of which are in our Drilling and Evaluation division. Many of these projects are in Sub-Saharan Africa, as I mentioned earlier. Outside of key deepwater markets, our pricing behavior is consistent with that of our peers and we believe that any suggestion that we have been more aggressive is inaccurate and misleading. For any bid outcome that we could be accused of having an aggressive price, I can give you one from each of our major competitors. So as the cycle enters a new phase, we believe that the contracts we have won will provide us with the opportunity to deploy new technologies and process efficiencies that create value for our customers and incremental margins for us. We see this strategy for deploying new technologies already working. For example, in a recent contract in Norway for drilling fluids, we replaced standard mod with a proprietary water-based system that provides the whole stability our customer was seeking, providing incremental value for the customer and an uplift in margins from single to double digits for us. In the Middle East, fluid sampling and magnetic resonance imaging tools were added to a wireline contract to assist our customer with their formation evaluation challenges. The expanded scope of this contract led to improved production for our customer that provided us with a 25% increase in contract revenues and improving margins. I could mention many more cases like this where we are seeing opportunities to broaden the scope of the services we provide our customers. By introducing these new technologies, we help improve our customers' effectiveness while at the same time favorably impacting revenue and margins. The pricing environment in the international markets has been challenging. However, we are now seeing the emergence of conditions that will enable leading-edge pricing to improve. Continued strong growth in certain geographies like Brazil, Colombia and Norway and volume increases in the Middle East and in deepwater regions are creating an inflection point. We believe this will serve to assist in the tightening of capacity and will lead to improved pricing by the end of the year. How much improvement and how quickly it comes will depend in large part upon commodity price behavior and the pace of the global economic recovery. So in the second half of the year, we expect a gradual progression of our international margins as activity improves. We expect our international margin expansion to continue into 2012 as leading-edge pricing improves and new technologies are introduced. Overall, we believe that what we are seeing in North America, plus the continued international recovery, will lead to even a more favorable earnings picture as we go through 2011 and beyond. The execution of our strategies is providing us with momentum for the second half of the year. By securing key contract wins, deploying new technologies and establishing bases in new frontier markets for Halliburton, we believe we are in a unique position to continue to outperform as the industry enters the next phase of the cycle. I'll let Mark give some more details now.
Mark McCollum: Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me provide you with our second quarter financial highlights. Our revenue in the second quarter was $5.9 billion, up 12% from the first quarter. Total operating income for the second quarter was $1.2 billion, up 43% from the previous quarter. Our results in the second quarter included approximately $11 million in employee separation costs, primarily related to our Europe/Africa/CIS region. Our first quarter results included a charge of approximately $59 million to reserve for certain receivables and inventory in Libya. I'll be comparing our second quarter results sequentially to the first quarter, excluding both the second quarter restructuring charge and the first quarter Libya charge. For North America, we saw our incrementals accelerate in the second quarter as we continued to benefit from the shift to oil and liquids-rich reservoirs. The combination of the greater service intensity of these basins, coupled with higher activity levels from capacity additions and rig count increases have resulted in better fixed cost absorption. We were also able to capture sufficient pricing to offset cost inflation. We believe that we are going to continue to see continued margin expansion in the third quarter, but we expect incrementals will be less than what we experienced in the second quarter due to both cost inflation and lower incrementals in the Gulf of Mexico. For international, we believe that margins will gradually improve from second quarter levels due to increased activity with margin improvement to be weighted toward the latter part of the year. In terms of our segment results, Completion and Production revenue increased $446 million or 14%, while operating income grew by 33%. The sequential incremental operating margin for the division was a healthy 51%, driven primarily by higher activity in North America. Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis, North America revenue increased by 17%, while operating income grew by 35% due primarily to higher activity and capacity additions across most U.S. land basins, especially in the oil and liquids-rich basins. Offsetting the strength in the U.S. land are the impact of the Canadian breakup and the timing of Completion Tools sales for the Gulf of Mexico. In Latin America, Completion and Production revenue increased 12%, but operating income fell 19% as higher employee and equipment costs in Argentina and Colombia offset higher production enhancement activity in northern Mexico and increased Completion Tools sales in Brazil.  In our Europe/Africa/CIS region, Completion and Production revenue increased 3% and operating income doubled, as seasonally higher activity in the North Sea and higher Completion Tools sales across the region offset lower activity in Algeria and the shutdown in Libya. In Middle East/Asia, Completion and Production posted sequential increases in revenue and operating income of 12% and 33%, respectively, due to increased production enhancement services in Saudi Arabia, higher Completion Tools sales in Kuwait and Brunei and a seasonal rebound in Australia. Additionally, the division saw increased stimulation work and higher sand control product sales in Indonesia. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income increased by 10% and 30%, respectively, led by gains in both North America and Latin America. In North America, Drilling and Evaluation revenue increased 13% and operating income improved by 44%, as most of our product service lines saw pricing improvements in U.S. land and continue to benefit from the increased horizontal rig count. Further, the division benefited from higher drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico, which was partially offset by the impact of the spring breakup in Canada. Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income increased 13% and 30%, respectively, due to drilling activity increases in Brazil, software sales in Argentina and consulting work in Ecuador. In the Europe/Africa/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income were up 9% and 27%, respectively, due to higher drilling activity in the North Sea and Russia and the recovery in Egypt's drilling operations, partially offset by rig delays in Angola and the shutdown in Libya. Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East/Asia revenue was up 4%, but operating income remained flat as higher wireline sales and services and software sales in Kuwait and higher direct sales in China fully offset project delays in Iraq and higher repair costs we experienced in Saudi Arabia. Now I'll address some additional financial items. We're making considerable progress in our initiative to reinvent our service delivery platform in North America and to reposition our supply chain manufacturing and technology infrastructure to better support our projected international growth. The investments for these initiatives, which are included in Corporate and Other, impacted our results by approximately $0.01 per share in the second quarter. These activities will continue into 2012, and we currently expect the impact of these investments to increase to $0.02 per share in the third quarter. And finally, the effective tax rate for the second quarter came in at 32%, which was in line with our guidance. For the balance of the year, we're projecting that our effective tax rate will be closer to 33% given the overall robustness of our North American operations. Tim?
Timothy Probert: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. We continue to develop technology innovations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of unconventional resource development. As Dave mentioned, the newly introduced RapidFrac completion system has provided material time savings and production increases, primarily because it allows a more surgical approach to stimulating the lateral and also allows us to reduce water usage. Improving reservoir conductivity is another key objective and has been a focus of ours for some time. We've introduced a range of conductivity enhancers such as SandWedge and Expedite, which provide improved flow powers for hydrocarbons through the fracture, resulting in sustained improvement in production. With some 25,000 treatments worldwide in North America, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, they're proving their value in a range of operating environments. Further on the innovation path, operators are constantly looking for technologies that maximize their fracture stimulation investment and there's a significant opportunity in building a permanent connection with the maximum amount of reservoir while balancing cost and time to initial production. Halliburton's new access frac uses a basin-specific design process combined with biodegradable and environmentally friendly chemistry to redirect the fracturing slurry into portions of the reservoir not previously treated. Trials have demonstrated much improved well productivity in a wider range of applications than even Halliburton's patented proppant pillar distribution technology used by us and others as a result of this greater stimulated reservoir volume. Now we continue to be very bullish about the global outlook for gas and unconventionals in particular. Last month, the IEA released a special report on natural gas in the global energy mix, projecting gas consumption will rise by more than 50% from today and will account for 25% of world energy consumption by 2035. Importantly, they estimate that unconventional gas resources are now equal to those of conventional fields. Exploration for unconventional resources is underway in many areas outside the U.S., including Mexico, Argentina, Australia and Poland, where here the government has granted 86 concessions and has attracted broad interest from IOCs and independents. In our recent integrated services award for Chevron's drilling program in southeastern Poland, we'll be providing project management in a wide variety of well construction and stimulation services for this 3-year contract. Worldwide natural gas development, both conventional and unconventional, will be an important component of the upcoming international cycle, and we believe this secular trend will be a key driver in our future prospects. Dave?
David Lesar: Thank you, Tim. Let me just quickly summarize. Our contract wins in key Eastern Hemisphere markets should allow us to expand our international margins in 2012 by introducing incremental technology. Our visibility in North America suggests a prolonged cycle with opportunities to improve our revenue and margins further. So at this point, we believe that these improvements in North America, plus the international recovery, will lead us to a more favorable earnings picture during the second half of the year and into 2012.  So let's open it up for questions now.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Anderson with JPMorgan.
John Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: As you start thinking about the strength of the North American markets in 2012, it appears that pressure pumping and other services still are the gating factor in rig count growth. But how concerned are you now about the kind of the pace of new build rigs out there? We've talked a lot about rig count kind of being restrained 10% to 15%. But how great a risk is there that rigs all of a sudden become that gating factor perhaps in the second half of '12?
Timothy Probert: Dave, this is Tim. I think that's possible, but the one thing that we're seeing is tremendous efficiency gains in terms of the overall drilling process, the well construction process, if you like. It's been quite impressive. I mean we're drilling laterals now up to 10,000 feet or so, and the degree of efficiency has, I think, been quite surprising to all. So I am frankly less concerned about rig supply today than I probably was 2 or 3 quarters ago.
John Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then, I guess, just following up on that North American side. Obviously, a very different market today than we were back in '06, '07, '08. How different is your strategy now in terms of kind of as you're looking at, say, pricing increases or perhaps how you're looking at cost or how you're actually adding in capacity? Is that -- how has your thinking evolved over the last time to really kind of in order to keep that kind of margins continuing to go progressively higher?
Mark McCollum: Dave, this is Mark. I think that probably the most marked difference in our strategy this time than last was, in the last cycle, we probably were more myopically focused on strictly increasing price to maximize margins. And I think this time around, what we're trying to do is to think more holistically about our position in the marketplace to develop a strategy where our pricing reflects value add to our customers, not only in the ability to integrate the products and services that we have so that it's -- so that our pricing model is lifting all of our product service lines, but also thinking about the returns that our customers are getting from the work that we're doing in each of the basins that they're working. Dave made a comment about our thinking about the dry gas basins in helping our customers there. And while I think that the difference in margins that we are receiving today have leveled out between those various basins, as we just think about that, we're covering our costs certainly and we're getting a little bit more pricing, but we're trying to add equipment on a customer-specific basis to address that they -- the work that they're presenting to us. We're trying to work with them in what I call a very symbiotic way to maximize their value, and I think that it's -- this type of environment is lifting all boats. So we're seeing margin increases. We're seeing, as we look out ahead, the number of customers coming forward with even more robust drilling programs, extending the relationships that we have with them not only through the end of this year, but the end of next year and beyond. And so at least from our view, there's still the ability to add capacity into this market. There's still a lot of work to be done. There's still a lot more value to add. And I think as a result, what we'll see is continued not only top line growth, but marginal growth as well.
John Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And there's still ability to add pricing as well?
Mark McCollum: Yes. But I think, again, we're trying to add price and making sure that we're covering our costs, but we're -- it's not all about just adding price for price sake.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Becker with Bank of America.
Douglas Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch: I want to touch base on the international margins. I think in the last call it was mentioned that there was the potential to get to 2010 levels late in the year. Is that still a realistic expectation given the second quarter results?
Mark McCollum: Doug, this is Mark again. I think that the way we look at trying to reach that margins that we had at the end of last year is still the goal for us. That's what we're working toward. Obviously, it's going to be very, very dependent upon recovery of some of the markets that Dave spoke to, the overall general economic recovery and the overall pricing environment, but we're still working toward it. But it's going to be challenging, we know that. And it's going to get -- we need some help from the markets to get there.
Douglas Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch: So I guess we -- the impact was talked about, I guess, 400 basis points, and certainly Libya and Algeria would seem to have limited visibility in those. Could those -- I guess what percentage of the Sub-Sahara Africa, the fixed cost structure in the U.K., how much of that 400 basis points would those 2 account for?
Mark McCollum: Doug, I don't know that I have that on the top of my head. We'll have to just kind of think through it. But obviously, it's not a small increment. I mean, those are -- they're smaller markets, but they're widespread and -- but I think as you think about Africa, the Libya market, the Algeria, those are all the largest markets in Africa. They'll definitely continue to be a drag as long as the conflicts there and the political issues persist.
Douglas Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then in the past, you've mentioned the number of uncompleted wells or at least your estimate. Any update to that number?
Timothy Probert: Yes. I think in the last quarter, we said there were about 3,500 wells and that -- we know that, that has crept up and probably will continue to incrementally creep up towards the end of the year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: The question I would have is on the sliding sleeve technology, you referenced that there's been a significant increase in efficiency and productivity. Just wondering what you guys may think that means from an industry standpoint. Or is that going to lead to too much, say, equipment-related capacity if the fracture becomes more efficient? And is this a Bakken-specific opportunity? It sounded like it isn't. So I'm just trying to gauge, with the increase in efficiency, how this all translates in your mind to a supply-demand balance as we head out into 2012.
Timothy Probert: Kurt, this is Tim. Yes, I mean, we're very pleased with the performance of RapidFrac to date and it's really providing some significant improvements in sort of well-to-well times for us and our customers. And there's no doubt that it allows us to be more efficient in what we do and allows us to optimize the performance of our fleets. But that's not something that we see spreading to the industry in general. I think this is something that Halliburton intends to capture for ourselves. So I don't see it having a broad impact on the industry at large.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay. And then Dave, maybe a follow-up for you. You referenced that the pace and magnitude of pricing improvement internationally will largely depend on some macro factors and I know how close you are to your large international customers. So what kind of hesitation or are your customers showing any reason to hesitate on their spending plans internationally? Are they getting cold feet or are they moving pretty aggressively forward?
David Lesar: I think, Kurt, a couple things. One is we're finally, I think, getting past the reengineering look and the process assurance look that a number of our customers were doing post-Macondo with respect to their offshore development. I think liquids prices are at a sufficient level that would allow these projects to go forward. These projects are getting sanctioned. They're getting final investment decisions in a positive way. It's really just how quickly the industry can gear up for some of these major projects. They're coming. Now whether they'll start toward the back end of this year or into 2012, they are definitely there. They're definitely coming at us, and we should get the benefit of equipment basically being picked up and put to work at that point in time. So I'm pretty optimistic that, that's all going to fall to the service industry's advantage.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Handler with Crédit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: Perhaps first to Dave just to come back to your comments on kind of where incremental margins are headed over the next couple quarters in North America. Perhaps you can parse out just how much the Gulf of Mexico contributed to that, to the 57% in the second quarter. So in other words, maybe if we just looked at the U.S. land business on its own, can you share the incrementals there?
Mark McCollum: I don't know that I want to share exactly the incrementals -- Brad, this is Mark. But the Gulf of Mexico incrementals were much higher than the U.S. land incrementals during the quarter. But again, we're coming off a very, very low base. And so I wouldn't expect that, that will continue as activity levels out there. And of course, we highlighted the fact that we are somewhat concerned that the pace of permit approvals have been slowing down quite a bit, and if you -- most of these permits were for single wells. That work's underway. At some point here, those are going to start wrapping up and the question is, what's next? And so we need that pace to pick up if we want to continue to expand the Gulf of Mexico operations.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: Understood. All right. I guess as a follow-up, if I stick with the U.S. land side of the business, you mentioned some cost creep impacting kind of the opportunity to raise margins. I understand that. But can you comment on the opportunities for volume, maybe sort of revenue per rig as you see it over the second half of the year but on a volume side?
David Lesar: Yes, I think -- this is Dave. Let me take the first shot at that. Certainly, with the frac equipment being a serious gating issue right now, our ability to pull through other services, I think, was really demonstrated this quarter. And I think it was easy to overlook one of the comments I made in that our incremental margins on our Drilling and Evaluation business in North America were basically the same as our Completion and Production. And so I think the pull-through is one. Adding capacity is certainly something we're doing in all of our product lines in North America. And obviously, we are well past the point where we have absorbed our fixed cost. So that should also have an ability to increase our margins without any pricing impact. We also are looking at -- on things like fuel or diesel, things like that, either going to customer furnished or to a peer pass-through on some of these things. So I would say there's a lot of moving pieces, but all of them added together gives us confidence that we should be able to expand our margins and our absolute operating income.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Congratulations in taking a significant share of international work in line with what you highlighted at your Capital Markets Day back in the fall. But could you sort of readdress a little bit where you stand right now on your strategy on market share relative to margin expansion?
Timothy Probert: Yes, this is Tim. I think that, as Dave said on this call, I mean, as we outlined to all of you during our Analyst Day, we're very focused on some specific areas, one of them being an area we felt that historically that we had underserved as a company for a variety of reasons, and that one being deepwater . And I think that was driven by a number of factors, including the availability to provide our customers with some of the technology which they required, and we worked hard on that as you know. And so I think that we've been very pleased with our win rate. We have gotten ourselves to a position that I think we feel fairly comfortable with, with respect to deepwater. And I think for us now the focus is on execution to make sure that we execute well, and we're confident we'll do that. And I think secondly, as Dave mentioned, I mean, lots of rhetoric around pricing out there in the market, but I stand by what Dave said. For every contract that someone whines about, I think I can demonstrate at least 1 or 2 where the offers they may be true with another competitor. So I think that's just in the noise.
Mark McCollum: Ole, this is Mark. Let me add to Tim's comments. You saw obviously, we took a restructuring charge in the quarter related to some employee separation costs. It was primarily focused in the part of the world that Dave highlighted were places where we were struggling a bit with our costs. Then I think that sort of lends to what Tim said that we are beginning to focus on margins. We've also been highlighting on a quarterly basis over the last several quarters the initiatives that were underway to -- part of those initiatives are addressing our North American service platform and reducing costs there. But there's a big chunk of that that's also addressing our supply chain and our manufacturing and technology delivery in the Eastern Hemisphere as well, and the headline on those is that's all designed to make us much more cost-effective and reduce our cost platform, service delivery platform in the Eastern Hemisphere as well. So all of these taken together are designed to sort of focus in on the cost side. And, of course, now as we get these projects underway, we've got the ability to begin to pull through other services, to add incremental high-value technologies that should allow us to expand the top line just as well. So it's definitely -- it's time to -- and we're focused on margins.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Okay. It sounds that you have gained the position that you want to have and it's about defending and it's about being more efficient and it's about getting more margin out of what you're doing. Is that correct?
Mark McCollum: That's absolutely right.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Another question on North America. You highlighted 2 constraints: people and proppants. I think we're all familiar with the people. But could you highlight a little bit what it means to be constrained on the proppant side and what you're doing about it?
Timothy Probert: I think, as you know, Ole, we have taken a fairly aggressive stance in terms of building capital equipment to satisfy what has been a gating issue in North America for stimulation equipment. And hand in glove with that, we have developed what I think is an extremely robust supply chain strategy, which our North America operations have executed. And that included -- has included investing in our supply chain to make sure that our supply chain can support our requirements. And that includes their specific investments in terms of providing proppant and our specific investments in making sure that we can get it to the well site effectively, and that includes obviously sand plants, transportation, et cetera, et cetera. So I think that there are clearly shortages in North America today, and there are some disruptions that I think certain service providers have experienced. I think we feel very good about our supply system and I think that making that investment, hand in glove with our capital investment, has paid dividends for us in the last quarter or so.
Mark McCollum: And so we're pumping about 1.3 billion pounds of proppants a month today. The entire industry pumped about 3 billion pounds in 2000. So I mean, it's quite dramatically different and we're obviously working to make sure that we have the proppant in the right place, the right proppant in the right place at the right time. It's obviously a very big challenge for the industry.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Mark, with regard to North American incrementals, I get the message with regard to a less robust rate of change in the third quarter for the Gulf of Mexico. On the other hand, you got Canada coming back. I know it's small for you guys, but when you distill it all into a conclusion, net pricing continues to be forthcoming, notwithstanding cost of goods sold, inflation, new frac equipment pricing, Canada up and Gulf of Mexico more muted. Are we in a range where incrementals are better than typical volumetric incrementals of, call it, 30% to 35%, but well off what we saw in the second quarter?
Mark McCollum: Yes. I think that you've probably got it targeted right. I mean, I think that, that should continue. But as you rightly said, Canada does -- is not going to really replace what potentially were the incrementals in the Gulf and I think that's going to be a big factor in this. And I think that you have some level of seasonal recovery that happens in Q2 that we offset from Q1 that probably played an impact in the incrementals this quarter that won't repeat. So I think you're absolutely right. As you think about the capacity additions and where those gross margins come in, the fact that we will get a higher fixed cost absorption will probably make it a little bit higher than the average margins today.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Okay. So it's not necessarily unreasonable to think about something in the 40% range?
Mark McCollum: I'm not going to give you any information on that. You'll have to pick your number.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Okay. I think I've already done that, but that's okay. And then secondly, with regard to international, you guys have been pretty consistent here with regard to the pace of international recovery, which is basically labored. And you're starting to refine your cost structure internationally. I guess to right-size to the expected environment and some of the dislocations that we talked about. With regard to the pricing initiatives that we -- that perhaps will be forthcoming late this year, probably not a P&L impact, but should we -- sometime this year, but should we expect the P&L impact from some of these pricing gains perhaps in 2012?
Timothy Probert: Yes. This is Tim, Bill. I think it's sort of helpful when we talk about this to sort of go back and sort of take a look at what is the fundamental driver for our business, which is rig count. And if we look in the short term back just over the last quarter, quarter-on-quarter, both land and offshore rig count is down about 2%. So that kind of demonstrates the labored nature of the recovery. And when we take a look at sort of year-on-year, you start to see some other pictures. On land, obviously, we've got Libya which declines a whole bunch; Asia/Pacific, flat; middle East is up; and Latin America was up. So it stands to reason to us that when you start to think about where you might exercise some increased pricing power, it's going to be in those areas where you've got a trajectory change in rig count. That means Latin America and that primarily is restricted to Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia. But Brazil, as we all know, is a very tightly managed market, and the ability to move margins there is more restricted perhaps than in other areas. And then in the Middle East where we've seen, obviously, big declines in Yemen. Saudi, in fact, is down year-to-year on land at least. And we're seeing some sizable increases in Kuwait with a restoration of Egyptian activity. So in terms of just kind of giving you a sense and a feel for what has to happen, we have to see a trajectory change and it's only in those areas where we're going to see a movement in rig count, which is going to drive that. So we feel, to answer your last point, that yes, we're starting to see some stability in these certain markets, starting to see that trajectory change in the markets that I've discussed seem to be, to us, the most likely ones where we'll see some ability to move price.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company International: And when we talk about moving price, Tim, are we talking about gross pricing or net pricing?
Timothy Probert: Volume becomes a precursor to pricing change, and as Dave outlined, I think with a couple of good examples, of which we have many, the first opportunity that generally is in the area of scope change, where operators may feel the need to expand scope to achieve certain objectives. And so what you'll see is volume, which obviously helps drive margin, accompanied by scope change. And then the third block in the chain, if you like, is our real changes in price.
Operator: Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with UBS.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: First, going back to the U.S. and the pressure pumping market, Dave. Your thoughts on your pressure pumping capacity additions that you could see in 2012, could you add as much capacity in '12 as you did in 2011?
Mark McCollum: Angie, this is Mark. I don't know that we want to give any information yet about that. We're going to be actually visiting with our board later this week to begin talking about our general views on the market. But maybe just closing and say it's fair to say, you heard our comments, it does not appear to us that this market is slowing down in any way. And so that may frame how the discussion goes. But I don't think at this point, we're in a position to say.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: All right. All right. A partial answer, I'll take it. And then also, the only relatively important segment that Halliburton does not operate in today is artificial lift. Strategically, do you believe that you need to be in this segment long term? And if so, what you consider your viable options to get into this business?
Timothy Probert: Well, I think that historically I would say that artificial lift has generally historically been considered to be a relatively stand-alone business. I think that, as you all know, whether it's on the well construction side, whether it's on the completion side or the stimulation side in general, the degree of integration which is either requested by customers or desirable from a service operator standpoint, is significant, and we continue to invest a significant amount in trying to improve efficiency and effectiveness. So I think as you look forward over the next 5 years or so, the degree of integration in all aspects of the completion, including artificial lift, intelligent wells, et cetera, will become a more important factor. As to how we plan to address that, Angie, I'm afraid that, that's something we prefer not to chat about.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: All right. And then finally on pricing in the international markets, you cited clearly that we're going to see a little bit of strength ultimately in the Middle East, parts of Latin America. Give us your thoughts on the rest of the markets, when can we see pricing? Is it not until the second half of 2012 in areas such as Southeast Asia, Russia, West Africa? Just a little color there.
Timothy Probert: I mean, we still -- Angie, this is Tim again. I mean, obviously, I have to go back to the basics, which is the rig count, and we have to see rig count and trajectory change to see the potential for pricing. And I think we've been pretty consistent in terms of our dialogue on a quarterly basis about the pace of the recovery and the fact that we have always felt that it's going to be somewhat sluggish. And that absent certain areas and deepwater that we've just discussed, I think we -- the jury is still out. I mean, look at some of these areas, the rig count changes just haven't happened yet, and I think we feel certainly more bullish as we look out. I would say that in general if we look at our quotation activity, it's coming through the system, we feel more positive about some of the areas you've just described. But it's going to require those rig activities to come through.
Mark McCollum: I was also going to add, it's also going to make a big difference on how our competitors behave because in some of those markets, there's still -- we're seeing our competitors continue to keep prices low.
Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: So still a very difficult market competitively?
Mark McCollum: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC: My first question has to do with the fracturing market in the U.S. And I was wondering if you could take just the major markets there and describe how you think supply demand has changed, if it's changed, both in the big oil basins such as Eagle Ford or liquids-rich basins, Permian, Bakken, et cetera. And then how things might have changed in areas like the Haynesville and Marcellus?
David Lesar: Yes, Jim, this is Dave. I think it's basically a tale of 2 cities. Any of the liquids plays, be it the Bakken, the Eagle Ford, the liquids ends of the Marcellus, they are all continue to be undersupplied and in some cases, undersupplied dramatically from a fracturing market. In some of the dry gas basins, we're starting to see competitors leave. We understand, I think, that we heard the other day that one of our major competitors has, I believe, has left Kilgore, or somewhere in the Haynesville. We are not leaving those markets, as I've said before. We have found, I think, a business model that would allow us to stay there with our customers and make the kind of returns that they want and the kind of returns we want. But I think that if you think about the dry gas basins, I would say, they're probably at equilibrium. And the oil basins or liquids basins, they all continue to be underserved.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC: Dave, might you, in looking at the market that you've indicated that you intend to stay in the Haynesville. But if pricing in the Haynesville does come off in here and it just continues to strengthen, might you take equipment out of those markets and move them into the oil markets?
David Lesar: Yes. As I said, Jim, I mean we have to find a business model that works for both sides. We are not going to leave equipment in a market that doesn't give us the kind of returns we want. So we will search for that model with a specific subset of customers. And if we get there, we'll stay. But if we don't get there, we will go to the liquids-rich play.
Mark McCollum: And we're bringing our costs down, as we speak, so that could be a ways off.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC: Okay. And then just one last question related to that, Dave. In the areas that are very strong, let's just take the Eagle Ford example, are you attempting in that region to package your -- I don't know if package is the right word, but sell your entire product line and package other products with pressure pumping services as far as part of the pressure pumping contract?
David Lesar: Yes, absolutely.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC: Okay. So that's a strategy. That's not just the case in the Haynesville, but it's the case across the board in the U.S.?
David Lesar: No. I think that anywhere where there is a market underserved by frac equipment and we have our other product lines, which we do, we will insist on some or most of our other product lines being involved with that customer.
Mark McCollum: We're even beginning to see some cases where our D&E product service lines are pulling through our frac work. It's actually turning the opposite way now. Yes, absolutely a strategy.
Operator: Our final question comes from Jeff Tillery with Tudor, Pickering.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: You guys are clearly optimistic about the business. The $3 billion CapEx number you guys have targeted and talked about this year, you've underspent a little bit. I'm just trying to understand is there -- are you running into bottlenecks in which you can -- is $3 billion the maximum you could realistically get through the Halliburton system? And if not, what would take that number to $3.5 billion or $4 billion?
Mark McCollum: No, no. There's no general constraints. I think it's just the pace of how things work through the system. Typically, when you approve your budget, it takes a little while for things to get mobilized. We do expect our CapEx for the entire year to probably be a little bit higher than $3 billion. I'm sort of currently forecasting maybe $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion for the year and it'll just -- as we go through the year, things will accelerate just a bit. So yes, no real bottlenecks at all.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.: All right. Understood. A quick follow-up question. Mark, you've mentioned some unusual Latin American costs in a couple of countries. Could you just provide a little color on that?
Mark McCollum: Obviously, there's some -- as we look across Latin America, there are small dollars that add up over the course of several ones. And there were some in Argentina related to personnel costs. They're somewhat unusual. I do not expect them to be a long-term added cost. It's just something that we had to deal with from an accounting standpoint. And then in Colombia as well, we had some unusual costs. There was -- we had some equipment problems due to -- had a loss there that we just had to take care of and clean up. And so my own view is that as we look forward, part of the confidence that I have that margins will improve is also that some of these costs will not repeat over the long term.
Christian Garcia: Okay. So before we close, we'd like to announce that our third quarter earnings call will be held on Monday, October 17 at 8:00 a.m. Central, 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Shawn, please close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day. Thank you.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Halliburton First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Christian Garcia, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please begin.
Christian Garcia: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton's First Quarter 2011 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release, announcing the first quarter results, is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Strategy and Corporate Development. I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and recent current reports on Form 8-K.  Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release announcing the first quarter results, which as I have mentioned, can be found on our website at www.halliburton.com. Dave?
David Lesar: Thank you, Christian, and good morning to everyone. The events in Japan, geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa and worst-than-normal weather patterns impacted the global energy industry in Q1. And these events weighed on our results, particularly, causing a significant decline in our Eastern Hemisphere margins in the first quarter and magnified the seasonal drop off we historically experienced in the first quarter of the year. This sharply contrasted with the excellent performance in North America, where margins progressed, as rig activity grew modestly in the quarter.  Given these factors, I am extremely pleased with our Q1 results. In my 16-plus years of experience at Halliburton, we've never had a quarter that's had so many moving parts in it. And despite these headwinds, the events that transpired have absolutely not dampened our enthusiasm for the long-term prospects of our business. And we continue to believe that the industry is on the verge of the next major up cycle. Overall revenue in the first quarter was $5.3 billion, which was a new company record. Against the prior year, revenue and operating income grew 40% and 81%, respectively, primarily, from continued growth in our North American operations.  Let me now discuss our operating results in more detail, starting with North America. So there's no mistaking our view going into this discussion. Since you know what our headline is, there is, clearly, room for revenue and operating income to grow as we get further into 2011.  Compared to our U.S. rig count increase of just 2%, our North America revenue and operating income grew sequentially by very nice rates of 13% and 16%, respectively. The growth came from our continued strategic investments in the North America market.  Our Q1 results were impacted by abnormally harsh weather in areas such as the Mid-Con, the Rockies, and particularly, the Bakken, where we have a disproportionate market share of the work.  As we pointed out in our fourth quarter call, we estimated there were approximately 3,100 uncompleted wells at the end of the year. Given the constraints brought about by the weather in the first quarter, we believe the number of uncompleted wells increased to roughly 3,500 at the end of Q1. We expect to work off some of these backlog in the second quarter, depending on industry capacity adds and customer activity levels. The shift to the oil- and liquids-rich plays remains unabated, and as evidenced by oil-directed rig count growing 11%, while the gas rig count declined by 5%. Horizontal oil-directed activity represents the fastest-growing segment in the market today, growing approximately 170% over the prior year. The structural change toward oil- and liquids-rich reservoirs has favorable implications to our overall business. Oil development requires longer laterals, a higher number of frac stages, much more complex fluid systems and increased profit volumes. These factors are driving the increased service intensity of the unconventional oil reservoirs compared to those in the dry gas areas. Historically, service intensity has been measured primarily by horsepower deployed per job. However, given the structural change towards the liquids-rich reservoirs, the driver for service intensity has shifted toward fluid chemistry, completion design and other technologies. Taking all of this into account, we currently estimate the average revenue per oil in liquids-rich well could be 1.4 to 1.8x that of a dry gas well, depending on the basin that you're in. The work in oil- and liquids-rich plays is technically more complex. We believe the shift to these resources will persist and continue to benefit service providers that have reservoir knowledge, premium technology and most importantly, integrated service offerings.  We are developing, also, fluid solutions that set new standards for environmental performance. We continue to improve public access to the ingredients we use in our frac-ing fluids and are disclosing the ingredients used in a typical fracturing formation on our website. Going forward, I feel even more confident about the resiliency of North America activity through 2011 than I did at the beginning of the year. Elevated oil prices are increasing operator cash flows, which together with their ability to raise capital, provide us an expanded availability to use these funds as they invest them. In addition, the geopolitical turmoil in certain international oil-producing basins is, once again, forcing customers to look toward more stable markets, like the U.S. This could lead to even further acceleration of upstream spending in the U.S. and North America.  Gas-directed drilling activity continues to be curtailed, now down about 10% from the levels experienced during the summer of 2010. In the near term, we continue to believe that gas drilling could remain under pressure, as gas produced in association with oil and NGLs inhibit the correction of the oversupply situation. However, any curtailment in natural gas drilling should be more than offset by an increase in liquids-directed activity. As such, there is a bias toward increased activity on U.S. land for the remainder of 2011, and this is reinforcing our confidence on the sustainability of our North American margins throughout the year. We are seeing some inflation on various cost items like labor, chemicals and proppants, which may temper margin increases as we move forward throughout the year. As you know, we've been very bullish on the U.S. market when some of our competitors were not. We remain extremely bullish on this market, and we are very happy with the position we have in it today. Another very positive development in North America is the issuance of 10 drilling permits in the Gulf of Mexico. If you look at the service contracts associated with these wells, Halliburton will be performing approximately 30% of the drilling services and 40% of the completion work on them. This is actually higher than our historical market share.  Our customers continue to communicate their commitment to the Gulf and discuss potential projects using our existing contract base. Our strategy of keeping our infrastructure and most of our headcount during the deepwater drilling suspension, of course, impacted our short term results but is now giving us the ability to respond to our customers quickly. As activity recovers, we should start seeing the benefits of this strategy. We will start moving some of our personnel and equipment, currently deployed in U.S. land, back into the Gulf in the coming quarters. Let me now turn to our International business, starting with Latin America. Latin America posted good results for the quarter. We are seeing shale development work evolving in many parts of Latin America, and we are excited about leveraging our expertise in unconventional resources to help our customers unlock the potential of these plays. Mexico continues to be challenging, and we expect growth in our Latin American region for the rest of 2011 to be led by Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and Argentina. In Mexico, we continue to make progress in our Remolino lab project that will be utilizing our horizontal and completions techniques to enhance production for the Chicontepec field. We are also seeing potential increases in offshore activity. But despite these opportunities, the reduction in activity in the northern region will tamper the expected overall growth in Mexico for 2011. Now let's turn to the Eastern Hemisphere. In our fourth quarter call, we reminded everyone of the typical seasonality-related declines that historically occurred in the first quarter of the year. These items were further exacerbated by harsher weather and disruptions caused by the turmoil in North Africa and the continued impact of overcapacity, leading to pricing pressures.  Now so you don't get too excited about our North -- don't get too excited about our Eastern Hemisphere margin drop. We expect our Eastern Hemisphere margins to improve in the second quarter. They will, however, continue to be impacted by the situation in Libya and by competitive pricing. As activity accelerates during the second half of the year, we anticipate margins will return to the levels seen in 2010.  Now let me tell you about the events that impacted the results in Q1. Normal decline from Q4 due to seasonality of software, sales, direct sales and weather-related slowdowns accounted for approximately $110 million of the decline. North Africa political unrest and other disruptions to operations, causing operating losses in the Libya charge, accounted for about $105 million of the decline. We also experienced delays in Iraq, where we finished work-over activity and expected to immediately begin integrated drilling programs on several of the contracts that we won. There have, however, been customer delays, mainly due to site access issues and unexpected delays in the government ability to move forward with the approval of contracts. All of this we estimate reduced operating income by approximately $20 million over Q4 in Iraq. Going forward, weather should clear itself up in Q2 and not have a significant impact on our near-term results. Egypt, while not operating at 100%, should be nearing normal activity levels in the next several months. In Libya, there is no relief in sight, and our operations are completely shut down for the foreseeable future. We took a charge for receivables and some property -- personal property-related issues and some compromised inventory. We have however, taken no impairments for fixed assets at this time, and we have some insurance to cover issues like this. But impairments to fixed assets could occur as the situation remains very fluid, and obviously, we will continue to monitor it carefully. And in Algeria, while things are getting better, the industry is still having issues getting administrative approvals on contracts and contract extensions.  In Iraq, the impact of project delays was unfortunate in its timing, as we were fully mobilized to move from work-over activity to integrated drilling. We have, however, maintained our mobilization readiness despite these delays, and we now expect that our work on these projects will start in Q2 and Q3. We are still very optimistic about the market in Iraq. We continue to win work there, and we expect to be profitable in our operations in 2011. Pricing also continues to pressure profitability, and leading edge pricing remains highly competitive across the industry in almost all markets. Tendered or negotiated prices that were set in the last several years will continue to hamper any significant margin improvement in the international margins for the entire industry, despite the higher volumes that we are seeing.  So as I said, we expect our Eastern Hemisphere margins to improve in the second quarter. They will, however, continue to be impacted by the situation in Libya and by competitive pricing. But as activity accelerates during the second half of the year, we anticipate margins will return to the levels seen in 2010. Going forward, oil fundamentals remain robust, as supply disruptions stemming from the unrest in Libya and other countries continue to exert pressure on the industry's overall production capacity, some of our customers have indicated to us that they are now looking to increase activity in other parts of the world in the second half of the year. One example of this is in Saudi Arabia, where our customer is planning to increase the rig count approximately 30% in the coming year. Fortunately, 60% of this increase will be assigned to the Manifa project. Manifa would add approximately 900,000 barrels per day to the country's production capacity.  Halliburton, as you will recall, won the offshore portion of Manifa in 2008. The project was delayed due to the global recession, but will now start mobilizing in the next several months. And we believe you will see an impact from the increased activity on Manifa in the second half of the year. The potential activity increase in Saudi, although positive, has not changed our view on the pace of the international recovery. We have won a number of recent contracts and strategic growth areas, giving us further confidence in this strengthening market. And Tim will discuss these in a few minutes. We are very pleased with the progress we have made so far in focusing our resources into the market's fastest-growing segments. We continue to commercialize our core technology. We continue to win key contracts. We continue to make the necessary investments to ensure that we gain momentum as the industry enters the coming up cycle, both in the U.S. and the international markets. Now I'll have Mark give a little more flavor on the financial results. Mark?
Mark McCollum: Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Our revenue in the first quarter was $5.3 billion, up 2% from the fourth quarter. Total operating income for the first quarter was $814 million, down 17% from the previous quarter, as strong growth in North America was offset by declines in our Eastern Hemisphere business.  As Dave mentioned, the first quarter results included a charge of approximately $59 million to primarily reserve from doubtful accounts receivable from the Libyan national oil companies and certain inventory that we believe has been compromised during the unrest. Now I'll be comparing our first quarter results sequentially to the fourth quarter of 2010, excluding the impact of the Q1 Libya charge. For North America, margins in the first quarter increased from the prior quarter due to stronger activity and improved pricing across most basins. March activity came in much stronger, and margin significantly improved, coming out of the winter season, assisted by higher capacity and pricing. Even with relatively stable pricing and activity, we're anticipating an increase in North America margins in the second quarter, although they could be somewhat restrained by cost inflation.  Now in terms of the segment results. Completion and Production revenue increased $187 million or 6%, while operating income remained flat. Strong North America and Latin America results were offset by the declines in the Eastern Hemisphere, where we saw lower vessel and other activity in the North Sea, seasonally lower Completion Tools sales and political unrest and other disruptions in North Africa. Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis, North America revenues increased by 16%, while operating income grew by 19% due to higher activity in pricing and oil- and liquids-rich shale basins, where increased completions intensity continue. In Latin America, Completion and Production revenue and operating income increased 11% and 50%, respectively, due to increased cementing activity in Colombia, higher stimulation activity in Argentina driven by shale work, higher well intervention and vessel activity in Mexico.  In Europe/Africa/CIS, Completion and Production revenue and operating income decreased 22% and 89%, respectively, due to lower vessel and other activity, as a result of weather-related issues in the North Sea, seasonally lower Completion Tool revenue across the region and activity disruptions in Egypt and Libya.  In Middle East/Asia, Completion and Production posted sequential decreases in revenue and operating income of 7% and 31%, respectively, due to project delays in Iraq, as Dave mentioned, and seasonally lower Completion Tool sales in China. This was partially offset by stronger Boots & Coots activity, particularly, in Oman, Saudi Arabia and Australia. Now in our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income declined, primarily, as a result of seasonally lower direct sales for Wireline and Landmark Software, delayed drilling activity in Iraq and the U.K. and the shutdown of operations in Libya. This lower activity was partially offset by improved North America results. In North America, Drilling and Evaluations revenue increased 7%, as most of our product service lines continue to benefit from increased horizontal rig count, which grew approximately 4% from the fourth quarter. This has favored our well construction technologies, and we expect this underlying trend will continue. Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income declined 3% and 26%, respectively, due to the typical slowdown in Landmark revenues across the region, offsetting higher shale activity in Argentina and Mexico and increased Fluids business in Brazil. In the Europe/Africa/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income were down 7% and 38%, respectively, due to weather-related seasonality in the North Sea and Russia, and activity disruptions in North Africa, which were partially offset by higher offshore drilling activity in Angola and East Africa. Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East/Asia revenue and operating income were down 12% and 56%, respectively, from seasonal declines from Landmark Software and direct sales in China and costs incurred from delayed project start-ups in Iraq. Now I'll address some additional financial items. As we discussed in our fourth quarter call, we're making some additional investments in our business model throughout 2011 to lower our service delivery costs in North America and reposition our supply chain, manufacturing and technology infrastructure to support our projected international growth. These investments, which we're including in Corporate and Other, impacted our results by approximately $0.01 per share in the first quarter.  We slowed down these activities as we experienced significant declines in our Eastern Hemisphere operations. Over the coming quarters, we plan to continue to separately highlight these investments for you, and we currently expect the impact to be $0.01 to $0.02 per share in the second quarter. And outside of these investments, we expect our Corporate and Other expenses to be in the range of $60 million the $65 million per quarter for the rest of the year.  Our first quarter 2011 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a tax election we made, with respect to the foreign subsidiary that allowed us to recognize some additional foreign tax credits. We expect the effective tax rate for the balance of the year to be between 32% to 33%. And finally, a year ago this week, the industry experienced one of its biggest operational and environmental challenges with the accident in the Gulf of Mexico. While more than 100 crew members survived, it's with great sadness that 11 lives were tragically lost. Out of this tragedy, however, have come unprecedented changes in establishing improved best practices, particularly, when it comes to safety and the approach to sustainability. Along with all the changes in industry practices, there are also many moving parts on the legal front. Over the next several weeks, we expect a number of claims, counterclaims and lawsuits to be filed among all parties involved in the well, alleging ordinary and gross negligence against each other, in order to preserve their options in the ongoing litigation. Given the current and impending legal challenges related to the incident, we'll not entertain further questions regarding these issues on this call. Tim?
Timothy Probert: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Dave mentioned, we've been very pleased with the series of contract awards this quarter, which underpin our thematic growth areas.  Internationally, we're seeing strong trends in the development of complex, higher-temperature and higher-pressure reservoirs. And we saw success in penetrating key deepwater basins with our High Pressure/High Temperature technologies and key wins with Chevron Thailand and Statoil in Norway. We've invested in the development of the broadest portfolio of High Pressure/High Temperature technology in the industry, allowing us to execute complex wells in the harshest offshore environment and, of course, to strengthen our position in these markets. Since the beginning of 2010, we won approximately 70% of all HP/HT services that have been tended in the North Sea. In addition, we are pleased to have been selected for the provision of a wide range of services in the Malay Basin, including directional drilling, logging-while-drilling, cementing, fluids and testing and completion services. The Malay Basin, incidentally, has the highest temperatures amongst offshore basins, and this project pushes existing technology limits with requirements exceeding 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Integration of our services has been an important differentiator for us in driving market penetration in support of our key growth themes. We have supported this with technology investment in highly efficient workflows under our Digital Asset initiative and, they're providing compelling value propositions to our customers. We recently announced the contract award for integrated drilling and well services in Norway for Fast Track development projects on up to three offshore rigs that are designed to reduce time from plan to production in half. This, together with the Shell, Majnoon and Exxon drilling package contracts awarded in Iraq, provide growing evidence of our customers' interest in our ability to integrate drilling and completions workflows to provide efficiencies for their projects. We envisioned that these types of contracts will continue to grow faster than our discrete business portfolio. Upcoming projects for Apache and Argentina and PEMEX on the Mexico side of the Eagle Ford play will also largely be delivered through our packaged and integrated services model.  Contract models are evolving from fixed price contracting arrangements to models that include performance-based and various other risk-reward mechanisms, which are quite attractive to us. The integrated and packaged services model has grown significantly for us over the last two years, and our project management team is today managing over 100 strings globally. Dave?
David Lesar: Thanks, Tim. Just to summarize the call, going forward, I feel even more confident about the prospects of our North America business in 2011 and beyond. We believe there is room for upside in both revenue and margins, as we respond to the continued increases in service intensity. And while our Eastern Hemisphere margins were adversely impacted in the first quarter, we expect recovery in the second quarter, and as activity accelerates in the second half of the year, expect margins to return to 2010 levels. And finally, we are gaining momentum in targeted growth areas, as evidenced by us winning several large key contracts. So with that, let's open it up for questions, and we'll go from there.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Anderson with JPMorgan.
David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors: Thanks. Dave, quick question about your margins going forward, really, on the D&E side, seems to be one of the keys to earnings growth for Halliburton, kind of 12 and 13, is getting the D&E international margins up higher. Just taking a -- stepping back, I guess, from the issues we've seen this past quarter, can you talk about whether you see some of the drivers to maturely improve these? And when do you see them kind of eclipsing the 20% mark?
Timothy Probert: Dave, this is Tim. I think a couple of points there. I mean, clearly, D&E was impacted quite significantly by the unrest in North Africa, important market for us. And as you know, we've been gearing up quite significantly in Iraq for our drilling packages there also. And the sort of delays that Dave referred to on the call, with respect to the start-up of those projects because of delays in clearing sites and getting the civils completed, were also quite impactful to us too. So I think, number one, obviously, then is the restoration of some of those activities around getting back to normality for some of those projects. Clearly, we're going to see a significant improvement in Saudi in the coming couple of quarters. We're going to see a significant impact to the Saudi activity offshore. Manifa is a significant project for us. And as you well know, the service intensity in Saudi in their offshore and onshore projects is quite high. So the combination of that, plus the mobilization for a number of the project wins, which we have made, I think, are all a contributing factors towards getting back onto a stronger trajectory for D&E margins in the second half of the year.
David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors: Is that, partly, also, a function of where we are in the cycle? I guess, would you expect the D&E -- because I know, it's in kind of the '06, '08 -- is when you really saw the D&E margins pickup. So is that sort of a function of the cycle as you kind of get more on to the exploration side as well?
Timothy Probert: Yes, most definitely. I think as exploration activities starts -- and we're, clearly, going to see a significant increase in exploration during the front end of this cycle. That's always very helpful to D&E margins.
David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors: I guess on a related note, curious about what you're hearing out there on offshore development activity. Would you expect that to start picking up over the next 12 months? And the discussions you have with operators, are they talking about moving projects forward? Is there kind of a greater sense of urgency out there right now, kind of oil prices and potential supply disruptions?
Timothy Probert: I think in general, I would say that there is an increasing confidence. Psychology of the market, as you well know, is really important. And this does create a sense of confidence in terms of the underlying commodity price. So I would say, just generally, yes, there is a stronger sense of wanting to move ahead confidently. However, we also have to say that I don't think it's actually been seen yet in terms of actually increasing overall activity or putting incremental rigs to work. But in general, to answer the first part of your question, clearly, we're pretty enthusiastic about offshore activity, in general, in the second half of this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Doug Becker with Bank of America.
Douglas Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Dave, you mentioned that international pricing is still highly competitive in most markets. Does this mean that we're still seeing pockets of weakness? And what would have to change to change your expectation about the pace of the international recovery?
David Lesar: Well, I think, you got to look at it sort of two ways. One, I think, we clearly see the volume increases coming at us because of the activity increases, and that will absorb the overcapacity out there. And I really wouldn't say that there's pockets on a geographic basis of sort of price competition. I would just say on any large tender today, there's plenty of competition, and significant price concessions being given. That tends, in my experience, to go away, as capacity gets absorbed and people start to focus more on margins and returns and less on getting the original contract in hand. And I think, right now, we're still in sort of the competitive phase of this, but we see sufficient volume coming at the end of this year and into next year that hopefully will absorb that capacity.
Douglas Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch: And just a quick follow up, man. In terms of -- when you think about capacity utilization, how do you think about that? Should we be looking at rig count, or is there a better way to be measuring that?
David Lesar: No, I think rig count is probably the best surrogate, especially, if it's a deepwater offshore rig, and then you sort of apply your service intensity multiple to that. And I think you can make a pretty good estimate of how fast industry -- spare industry capacity in oil services can get soaked up.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Jefferies & Company.
Stephen Gengaro - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Two related questions: one, on the CapEx side. Are there any changes to your plans? And how is sort of the roll out of the equipment in North America are proceeding? And along those lines, how should we think about North America pricing, as we kind of go forward over the next several quarters?
Mark McCollum: Stephen, on the CapEx side, I think, we're still on our plan. You should expect, I think, 2011 CapEx to be, probably, close to about $3 billion. That's sort of where we've been aiming. Again, most of that CapEx, or at least a higher majority of it will be North America, as we're rolling out our pressure-pumping capacity. This year, we have got a number of infrastructure projects going on around the world as well that will be influencing that number. In terms of capacity rollout, we're on schedule. I mean, I think that you saw a little bit of that influencing our March results and why they came in so strong. And we continue to see that CapEx rolling out systematically as the year progresses. It's contracted. We know where it's going to go and work, and we're staying the course, as we speak. Your second question, I think that -- our general view because that capacity is, basically, being fully absorbed, we saw in the quarter continued increase in service intensity, we saw increases in the amount of horsepower required per job, and we saw an increase in the amount of 24 hour operations that tells you that the environment is still right to continue to move pricing. And so we are continuing to do that, particularly, with regard to making sure that we're more than covering cost inflation that's also pushing against us. And so we still believe that we can continue to move margins forward as the year progresses in North America.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Boyd with Goldman Sachs.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: I'd like to follow up on that last comment. In looking at North America, pressure-pumping intensity versus overall service intensity, clearly, up nicely in the quarter. But can you talk about how much of that sort of revenue growth came from the pressure-pumping intensity side of it than versus the just overall increase in service intensity from some of that -- the other value-added services that you mentioned in the press release during the conference call?
Timothy Probert: Yes. I think, just a quick comment on pressure pumping, first. We, during the course of the quarter utilization levels, actually, surpassed those at 2008, which I think is another interesting data point for you. But to answer your question fully, I think we're seeing it across-the-board, whether or not it's pressure pumping, drilling and evaluation or completions activity or others for that matter. It's an across-the-board phenomenon. And I think as I've referred to in my kind of prepared comments, this sort of concept of integration is something that is working very positively for us. We believe it is a differentiator for us, and it gives us the ability to provide a platform in which we can essentially bring everything along in that portfolio at a fairly sort of even level, and benefit all elements of the company equally.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: That makes sense. Can you comment or give us a little more detail on the strategic placement of frac stages that you highlight in the press release? Just how meaningful is that to the business? Where are you in evolution of that? And I assume that's something that is more unique to the integrated providers like yourself?
Timothy Probert: I think that, clearly, as Dave referred to, we're seeing a significant shift in the way in which the industry is evolving towards both the oily and liquids-rich activity. And there are significant differences in terms of the way in which we complete those wells relative to dry gas wells. And so what you're seeing is an increased degree of complexity, and frankly, an underlying commodity price, which allows you to drill longer laterals, more stages and complex completions than we've seen here too. And that's driving the service intensity change of sort of 1.4 to 1.8 relative to dry gas that Dave referenced in his call.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much. On the seasonality and weather number highlighted at $110 million, how much of that was domestic versus international?
Mark McCollum: Ole, none of it was domestic. It was all international. As I said, we had a slight disruption to our U.S. operations due to weather, mainly in the Rockies, the Mid-Con and the Bakken that caused a slight decrease to the margins and revenue stream with respect to Q1. But the amounts we highlighted were totally Eastern Hemisphere.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: So if we add all that up, the $110 million, $105 million, and $20 million, that's $235 million to the $2.3 billion of sales internationally. So that just suggests about a 10% margin effect?
Mark McCollum: Yes. That's about right, Ole.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: And you did 9.4% margin, internationally. So does that suggest that in a normal environment and today's pricing -- I mean, normal environment, we can all scratch our heads and ask what that is, of course. But does that mean that we're looking at an underlying run rate, really in the high-teens, when the role settles down again with no further pricing improvements?
Mark McCollum: I don't know. I haven't said here we're trying to do the math, but I don't know that they would work out that perfectly. I mean, clearly, there's a pricing impact that's continued to impact margins overall. As Dave indicated, pricing continues to be fairly competitive. And as contracts start, we're still having the influence of that -- of the negative pricing over the last year or so that's still creeping into the margins. So I don't think it will work out that perfect. But clearly, some of these things have an impact on margins, strictly, because of your fixed cost level that you had to incur to maintain operations even if the weather shuts things down.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: Yes, but it does suggest that the underlying international activity or profitability level is quite maybe significantly better than what these numbers suggest.
David Lesar: Yes, I think, Ole. That's why we indicated we were confident that margins will start to increase next quarter and head back to where they were last year. And then you've got to factor in sort of where the pricing competition evolved the balance of the year. So as Mark said, I don't think it's a perfect calculation as you laid it out, but the trend would certainly be towards swinging it back to last year's margins, if not a little higher.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: And how do you think about, Dave, allocation of capital-constrained equipment, whether it's directional drilling, rotary steerable. I mean, I'm sure you have a whole bunch of tools that you consider where to send around the world when you're making these kind of returns in North America. I'm a little baffled that international pricing is as competitive, when you can make these outstanding returns in North America and the market that arguably is becoming a lot more visible and transparent everyday with the order lag. How do you think about that?
Timothy Probert: Ole, I think that argument would presuppose that all equipment is created equal for all applications, and that's really not the case. What we use, how we use it, and essentially, the orientation of businesses in North America tend to be quite different than in the international market. As you know, in the international markets, they tend to be much more Drilling-and-Evaluation-led. The North America markets tend to be more production-and-completion-led. And so I think that's probably one of the underlying reasons why you don't see the sort of complete freedom of movement of assets around the globe, because they're not always completely suitable in those applications.
Mark McCollum: Of course, the other thing I'd like to say, Ole, is we were hurt, clearly, by the issues in North Africa. We can't get those assets out of Libya right now, that's part of the issue. So you've got assets that are sitting there that no service company can actually get access to.
Timothy Probert: As a closing comment, in general, the international markets tend to use a higher service intensity in international markets, even on land rigs, intensity much higher. Use Saudi as an example, Kuwait as an example. It's much more comparable, in terms of the delivery with something that we might utilize in the Gulf of Mexico than it is onshore in U.S.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
William Herbert - Simmons: Thanks. Mark, back to North America and pricing and margins for a second here. You talked about the fact that there isn't a whole lot of difficulty absorbing the incremental frac capacity that's being brought online. As pricing continues to move higher, you're going to be offset by oil service cost of goods sold inflation. And my question is how does that distill into a view on incremental margins. And last year, for the first three quarters, while you were getting pricing activity and service intensity uplift, incrementals for C&P we're between 45% and 56% quarter on quarter. We had a drop in the Q4, 28%, because of, I would assume, in part due to the drop in your Gulf of Mexico work. And then we had, again, relatively subdued incrementals in Q1 of 31%, 32%. So how should we think about incrementals, going forward?
Mark McCollum: Well, we're not going to give you any specific guidance for different reasons, Bill.
William Herbert - Simmons: Yes.
Mark McCollum: I appreciate that. But I think that you should pick up from our comments that we do remain confident that we think that the incrementals will continue to be good, that it will continue to increase. We feel we've kind of hit the bottom on the Gulf of Mexico, obviously, with the increased permits, while it takes some time, we still expect that as the year progresses, the Gulf of Mexico will start getting back to work, and that comes at a nice consistent margin that historically has been quite good. So that will add to the mix, favorably. And then when we look at our margins, particularly, in March, where you had a month that was not influenced by weather, with stronger activity and the rig count, it just says we do expect a bump in our margins in Q2. And as we look out across the year, there's no reason in our view today to expect that, that will not continue to sort of move up as the year progresses. Now it's not going to be at the same pace as we have last year, that's certainly the case, but there is incremental opportunity if you continue to improve our margins. And of course, the second thing, part of the strategic initiatives that we're working on, that we highlighted at our Analyst Day last year, is continuing to work hard on addressing our cost structure as well, so that we can continue to be the lowest cost service provider out there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Roger Read with Morgan Keegan.
Roger Read: Just wanted to follow up on the issues weighing on the international margins. As you kind of look by region, obviously, Manifa is going to kick off here. You've got the trouble in North Africa. But maybe a little more detail on Latin America and the Asian markets, if you could.
Timothy Probert: Well, first of all, just on Manifa, obviously, Manifa will be a benefit. But bear in mind, that those rigs will come in sort of rapidly over the balance of this year. So we will not see a significant one-time impact of that. It will change as we go through the course of the year. You mentioned Latin America. Clearly, Brazil continues to be a positive growth environment for us. Argentina, we've referenced a couple of times, particularly, as it relates to unconventionals and the growing benefits there, particularly, as our customers derive benefit from, of course [ph], new gas pricing which is providing them some confidence to do additional work and invest incrementally. Andean countries, in particular, also, are showing some positive signs. Mexico, the brightest spot there, I think, revolves around two things for us. Number one is the southern development of the Eagle Ford, both in terms of the dry gas leg and also, the oily leg for PEMEX in Northern Mexico, which is clearly a positive for them and us. And the very good progress that we're making with our Remolino lab in Chicontepec, which if you'll recall is, PEMEX's focus on, really, adding a greater degree of G&G capability and underlying science to the development of that reservoir.
Roger Read: And kind of an unrelated follow up, in North America on the cost inflation side, can you kind of give us an idea of what the bigger issues there are other than the obvious one of labor?
Timothy Probert: Well, clearly, labor, yes, that most definitely is tight. That is a significant component of all of our -- in fact, the largest single component of our cost structure. And clearly, all elements of inflation are kicking in for whatever they maybe, whether they're on proppants, whether they're on transportation, you name it. There's. . .
David Lesar: Price has gone [ph] up quite dramatically so...
Timothy Probert: Inflationary pressures are there across-the-board, and we're working had to make sure that we contain them. And as Mark said, in terms of making sure that we're a fit into delivery of services and also recovering those inflationary factors through price increases.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated: There's been a lot of conversations related to the margins in the Eastern Hemisphere and with the progression, maybe, there. I was just curious, as we look more from a top line perspective, 2010 versus 2009, Eastern Hemisphere revenues were essentially flat. Can you talk about what kind of growth we're expecting on the top line Eastern Hemisphere, maybe 2011 versus 2010, as you guys see it right now, given what's going on in North Africa?
Mark McCollum: Again, I don't think that we want to give specific guidance as to what we think will be happening. We do -- as we said several times, we think activity is coming. We've seen that. We've seen our customers’ budgets as you have, increased significantly. We see a significant number of offshore rigs coming into the market. So areas like the North Sea, West Africa, we expect, as the year progresses, will begin to pick up. Tim mentioned Brazil just a second ago. I think that the issue that we're seeing right now, and part of the reason why you see the impact of just sort of year-over-year flat revenues, flat top line growth is the impact of pricing. That pricing has remained competitive, and that influence continues to mask some of the other activity-related increases that we've experienced, and we believe would be coming. And so we think that, as Dave mentioned, activity is coming and it's going to pick up as the year progresses. And that will have a pull activity-led, sort of margin pull for us in the early part of the year. And we're hopeful that as capacity utilization increases, that the market sentiment will change, that will allow us to begin to think differently about pricing, as we tender for contracts later in the year between us and our competitors, which will probably have more of an influence in 2012. But hopefully, we'll get some of that in late part of this year.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated: Sure. The project delays that were noted in Iraq of roughly $20 million, do you all believe that specifically just a function of your specific customers, or was that something that you think everyone in country likely experienced?
David Lesar: Yes. I think that if you look at -- if you had in sort of a brownfield drilling site, you have your infrastructure in place, and you probably are not as likely to have been delayed. And we didn't see delays for, instance, in a lot of our work-over activities that we were doing for various companies. But when you go to more of the greenfield opportunities, one of the things our customers are experiencing is preparing pad sites, and typically, that is out of scope of our contract. And when they're developing the roads too and these drilling sites, what they're finding is lots of unexploded ordinance, resulting from the Iraq-Iran war, and various wars that have been in there, and it's taking them substantially longer to get these drilling sites ready for us to mobilize, too. And so I think -- I would think of it more in terms of its brownfield versus greenfield. It's the greenfield projects that are tending to get pushed back a bit because of these site development issues.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: I just wanted to -- I know you've mentioned international margin on a number of different fronts, and just for clarity point, I just wanted to make sure I understand it, that on the international margin for 2011 -- on the year, if you look at 2011 versus 2010, are you looking at the same margin for the full year, or are you guys thinking more on the second, third and fourth quarter, that '11 would look like 2010? I just wanted to get some clarification on that, please. Thanks.
Timothy Probert: Yes. I think we're looking at the, obviously, going forward here, Kurt. I think, clearly, the first quarter has been a very challenging quarter. And I don't think that we would expect at this stage to sort of get that one to make up. So I think you're looking at it correctly by looking forward.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Second, okay, all right. And then just a follow up here on the frac capacity. What do you think is coming into the market here in 2011? And are you still seeing interests from your customers and on term contracts? Those term contracts, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, have there been any change in the length that you're customers are trying to contract out this frac capacity?
Timothy Probert: Essentially, we could contract most of our capacity, probably about any terms we wanted to dictate at this point in time. But typically, we are keeping that relatively short. We are not doing essentially, fixed price contracts, we're doing performance-based contracts, which -- and our customers to reach certain levels of productivity, or we have the right to move that spread on to someone else. And we think that's the best way in this. Basically, there's market that doesn't have enough capacity to handle everything that's there. So we're trying to preserve our ability to be opportunistic, but make sure that as every piece of equipment comes out of the manufacturing plant we have, that it has a home to go to on day one.
David Lesar: I think in terms of the overall estimates or overall capacity coming to market, our estimates haven't really changed. I think, we still think that probably in the 3 million, 3.5 million-horsepower is probably what's coming into the market this year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.
James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC: I want to ask another question on pricing, internationally. It seems to me that the anecdotal stories about pricing, not just that the commodity end, but what have heretofore been the very largest, highest margin job has gotten extremely competitive out there. And I think, Dave, you've voiced optimism that when activity comes, it will all go away, or at least it will improve. But is it true, in your opinion, that pricing conditions are worse at this time than you might see at this point in other cycles? And do you think it may not all go away just due to various company strategies that exist out there?
Timothy Probert: Jim, this is Tim. I would say, in general, yes, I think things are more competitive today than we've seen them in the last couple of years, certainly. I mean, typically, when we think about pricing, and when you think about tightening pricing, you really think about changing trajectory of the market. And I think we would agree that we haven't seen a significant trajectory change in the market. I think, what we're starting to see now are some significant signs of trajectory change. Our IOC customers and independent customers are getting more confident about their spend. And in particular, the NOC customers -- and you see that, obviously, Saudi Aramco would be a good example, KOC [Kuwait Oil Company] is another example. And also in the UAE, we're starting to see some significant changes in terms of NOC spending patterns. They don't always typically follow the natural progression of the commodity prices. But as they kick in, you're going to see a change in trajectory of the market. We're going to therefore, see a tightening of supply. And I think, that to Dave's point, as we get towards the end of this year and into 2012, we will see more stability in the pricing markets.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Handler with Crédit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: Could I ask you -- let's see what's left here. Maybe Tim, you could come back to your comment about your receptiveness to performance-based and the risk-reward mechanisms and your enthusiasm about that? Are you now driving -- in tenders, are you now driving offerings to that regard, or rather, are you, generally, being pulled into offering, that sort of thing? Talk to us a little bit about that, please.
Timothy Probert: No, I think, we're very much driving towards incentive-based contacts. I think they provide good value for us. And I think that we have invested, as -- you know, Brad, quite a bit over the course of the last couple of years, in really developing efficient workflows, which can stitch together all the key elements of our operation, the key to our customers value proposition. They're not interested in just a collection of services at the well site, they want to see real value. And I think that we're delivering that value proposition, and it's making it a much easier sell for us to engage them in discussions around incentive contracting. And so I do expect that to continue over the course of the next year or two.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: To what extent are these about the timing, efficiency of well construction versus say, productivity or really production-related...
Timothy Probert: Yes, I think today, we're very much focused on time-based efficiencies, I would call them, both -- primarily in the well-construction phase. But I definitely think that over time, we have the potential to evolve those to production-based efficiencies too.
Christian Garcia: All right. Before we close, we'd like to announce that our Q2 2011 Earnings Call will be held on Monday, July 18, at 9 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Central. Sean, let's close out the call.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Christian Garcia, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please begin.
Christian Garcia: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Fourth Quarter 2010 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the fourth quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President of Strategy and Corporate Development. In today's call, Dave will provide opening remarks, Mark will discuss our overall financial performance, and Tim will provide comments on our operations and business outlook. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involves risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release announcing the fourth quarter results in our IR website. Dave?
David Lesar: Thank you, Christian, and good morning to everyone. Before discussing our fourth quarter results, let me begin by what I believe we accomplished in 2010. First, we strengthened our market leadership position by aligning our business to the industry's fastest-growing segments and deploying the full suite of our technical capabilities. We also commercialized key technologies like our ESTMZ [Enhanced Single-Trip Multizone] Completion System and GeoTap IDS that serve to solve our customers’ challenges in their most complex projects. We also introduced our CleanSuite of technologies, including a first of its kind fracture fluid system, comprised of material sourced entirely from the food industry, setting a new standard for how unconventional resources can be accessed and produced in the future. And lastly, we built infrastructure and secured key contract wins in Iraq, West Africa, Australia, Brazil, the North Sea and other places that are setting us up to benefit in the coming international cycle. Our 2010 total year results indicate the successful execution of our strategy, with total year revenue growth of 22% and operating income growth of 51% and market-leading returns of 15%. I believe we are in a great position for the opportunities and challenges we see in 2011. Let me now turn to our fourth quarter results. Overall, I'm very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter where we experienced double-digit growth in both North America and our international operations. Revenue of $5.2 billion represented growth of 40% over the prior year and represents the highest quarterly revenue in the company's history. Operating income more than doubled, led by a fivefold increase in North America. On a sequential basis, all regions showed double-digit revenue and operating income growth except for Latin America where we continue to experience challenging conditions in Mexico. Let me provide some detail now starting with North America. North America had another good quarter, with revenue and operating income increasing 10% sequentially, continuing to outpace the U.S. rig count of 4%. We historically see a moderation of our revenue per rig in the fourth quarter due to the effects of our holiday schedule and weather-related seasonality in the Rockies. However, the continued shift to oil plays with the unrelenting increase in completions intensity outweighed these seasonal impacts this year. In addition, we achieved this 10% sequential performance despite a significant reduction in revenues and operating income in our Gulf of Mexico business due to the completion of the Macondo relief well efforts where we provided most of the services. And in fact, we lost money in our Gulf of Mexico operations in Q4. We continue to believe that the prospects for a recovery in the Gulf of Mexico will remain uncertain through the first half of 2011 and perhaps the full year. However, I do believe it's prudent that we maintain all of our infrastructure and most of our headcount in anticipation of a rebound in the Gulf. And I'll make a comment on that later. In the fourth quarter, we continue to experience tightness and equipment shortages in basins that are undergoing rapid growth like the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. Average rig count in those two basins grew about 20% from Q3 to Q4, and discussions with operators indicate that the escalation in activities for these plays is not abating. Further, well complexity continues to rise within these plays, with lateral lengths that are now reaching beyond a mile. In fact, one operator has indicated that their future wells in the Eagle Ford will be drilled with an approximately 10,000-foot lateral, an increase from the current average length of 6,000 for that basin. Longer laterals, of course, mean more frac stages and higher demand in utilization of horsepower capacity. The shift in the oil and liquid-rich plays continues; it was quite apparent in the fourth quarter. The U.S. rig count grew sequentially 4%, but gas activity was down 2% and oil directed rigs increased 15%. This shift has been ongoing since the start of 2010 and, as our results demonstrate, has been beneficial in the dramatic recovery in our revenue and operating income. Work in the oil and liquids-rich plays can be as service intensive as the dry gas basins because these reservoirs require complex fluid systems to enhance conductivity along the entire length of the lateral. In addition, operators are using increased number of stages to exploit their production potential. This is evidenced in the Bakken shale where the leading-edge count of frac stages now exceeds 40. The average number of frac stages per well in the industry has more than doubled in the last two years. It is possible that this rate may moderate in the coming year. However, the continued shift to liquids suggests that the growth in the average number of stages will remain high in 2011. Now there is, of course, a continuing debate going on about the potential for an oversupply situation in pumping equipment into 2012 that may lead to a precipitous decline in the industry's margin. We do not share that view as it applies to Halliburton, and we believe that there are mitigating factors that may moderate the impact of new equipment on the industry's margins. First, pricing in the fourth quarter continued to improve, albeit in smaller increments. This has served to offset the cost of inflation for labor, freight and materials. With our increased volume of revenues, we also saw increased profitability improvement in our U.S. land operations in Q4. Going forward, we believe there are areas where we'll be able to continue to increase prices and believe operating margin expansion will be driven by continued drilling and completions intensity on the work that we see in the current and new unconventional basins. Second, unconventional resources are lending themselves to large well programs and have resulted in operators entering into longer-term contracting arrangements to ensure continuity of the supply for pressure pumping services. We believe that a large proportion of the new equipment coming into the market is under these types of longer-term contracts. This will reduce the amount of speculative or opportunistic capacity that will chase the call out market and with it, the potential to exert downward pressure on stimulation prices. Next, we believe that the number of uncompleted wells increased during the fourth quarter, and now are in a range of about 3,200 by the end of the year. Further, we expect that this count will rise in the first quarter of 2011 despite the anticipated capacity additions. This should provide stability to frac demand even in a flattening rig count scenario. Next, we saw the industry’s number of wells drilled per rig increase approximately 15%, resulting from the application of drilling optimization techniques. As the number of wells continues to increase on a per rig basis because of these incremental efficiencies, we believe that stimulation demand can continue to outpace the rig count. Also, international capacity is growing rapidly, with the development of new projects for unconventional resources. We recently performed the first shale job in Mexico. We were just recently awarded the Paris Basin work in Continental Europe by a major IOC and mobilized for additional projects in Argentina and other areas. The development of the international unconventional resources will provide an expanding channel for the absorption of our stimulation equipment. We've also aligned our business and equipment with operators that are levered to oil and liquids-rich basins, and we anticipate that the shift will persist throughout 2011. Beyond this strategy, as we outlined in our Analyst Day in November, we are also reinventing our service delivery platform to optimize efficiencies. We continue to make progress on delivering the key technologies in this reinvention process, which we believe will result in us sustaining our North American margin leadership position. As I have mentioned in the third quarter call, one of our competitive advantages is that we manufacture all of our own pumping equipment and are able to make rapid adjustments to our build plan if necessary. I can tell you, we will remain focused on delivering the highest returns for our shareholders, and we will adjust our build schedule if we see the influx of new capacity threatens to overwhelm stimulation demand and if margins come under pressure. As I stated earlier, our Gulf of Mexico business declined dramatically from third quarter levels and considerable uncertainty exists in the coming quarter as operators attempt to meet new regulatory requirements. Our large customers in the Gulf have indicated that they continue to be committed to the Gulf of Mexico and their portfolios there. And as I said, we will maintain our infrastructure to make sure that we can support them when they go back to work. However, we believe any meaningful increase in activity levels in the Gulf is unlikely for the first half of the year. Let me now turn to our International business, starting with Latin America. Latin America experienced sequential revenue growth, but flat operating income as continued strong growth in Brazil and Colombia offset a sequential decline in our Mexico operations. In the fourth quarter, our Mexico business was impacted by weather-related issues in the south, while overall activity across other parts of the country did not recover from the lackluster levels we saw in the third quarter. Mexico is a market that is still in the process of repair and the environment continues to be uncertain going into 2011. Despite the headline announcements that we've all seen, that indicate a resurgence may occur toward the end of 2011, at this point, we see no tangible evidence that any recovery will materialize in the next few quarters. In the past year, Latin America growth has been led by Brazil and Colombia with rates up to 30%. We believe that robust growth will continue in these countries, combined with stable activity in Argentina and Venezuela. However, overall growth in the region will be tempered until such time as the Mexico market recovers. Now turning to the Eastern Hemisphere. Our Eastern Hemisphere showed double-digit sequential growth due to a rebound in Norway, Algeria, Angola and the ramp up of our activities and revenue in Iraq. These increases in activity, as well as the typical year-end increases for Landmark software sales, completion sales and direct sales, contributed to the growth. We are also pleased to report that we were modestly profitable in Iraq for the fourth quarter, and we continue to build our employee base in that country. We currently have nearly 600 personnel working in Iraq and expect that to grow to nearly 1,200 by the end of the year to handle the work that we have won. We continue to win work in Iraq. In addition to the awards that we have publicly announced, we were recently awarded a 15-well package by an IOC. Due to the timing of the ramp-up in activity and start-up costs in Iraq, our results are likely to be uneven in the first half of the year. However, fourth quarter results and our current win rate for contract validates our early mover strategy and gives us confidence that we will meet our goals of having sustainable, profitable operations starting in mid-2011. Pricing in the Eastern Hemisphere remains highly competitive across all geographies and weighed on the industry's overall international results for all of 2010, and of course, that included the fourth quarter. We anticipate steady volume increases in 2011, but international pricing will remain competitive until existing capacity has been absorbed. However, it is clear to us that the macroeconomic trends support a very favorable operator spending outlook as we move forward. Given the significant prospects that we see and the excellent future demand that we see in the Eastern Hemisphere, particularly in deepwater and unconventional gas, we are executing several key initiatives in 2011 to continue to lower our cost of service delivery and to expand our manufacturing and technology footprint. First, in 2011, we are going to build additional manufacturing and technology infrastructure in the Eastern Hemisphere for our completions business. Our strategy serves to align our supply chain capabilities and technology development closer to our customer base in the Eastern Hemisphere.  In addition, we are building a world-class, state-of-the-art new technology center in Houston, and we'll be incurring costs in 2011 to consolidate several existing facilities in other parts of the U.S. into this new facility. These key investments reflect our strong belief that we are on the verge of a major up cycle in spending by our customers and will be a necessary step to meet our growth, return and margin goals. And Mark will discuss the impact of these investments in a couple of minutes. So to summarize, 2010 was a very successful year for Halliburton. We saw a dramatic recovery of our business and continued to expand our market position. In 2011, we will continue to build on this success to put us in a unique position to benefit from the upcoming cycle and achieve our objectives of superior growth, margins and returns. Mark?
Mark McCollum: Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Let me provide you with our fourth quarter financial highlights. Our revenue in the fourth quarter was $5.2 billion, up 11% from the third quarter and 40% from the prior year. Total operating income for the fourth quarter was $980 million, up 20% from the previous quarter. The third quarter results included a noncash charge of approximately $50 million to write down our residual interest in the Sangu oil and gas project. Going forward today, I'll be comparing our fourth quarter results sequentially to the third quarter of 2010, excluding the impact of the third quarter noncash charge. Sequentially, North America revenue and operating income grew 10%. North America margins in the fourth quarter were steady as higher land activity and some pricing improvements offset the decline in Gulf of Mexico. We historically see our first quarter results affected by some weather-related seasonality in the Rockies and the Northeast U.S. and the extremely cold weather this month across the northern part of the country suggests this year will be no different. Internationally, revenue and operating income grew 11% and 15%, respectively, driven by activity improvements in certain key markets and seasonal increases in Landmark completion tools and direct sales at the end of the fiscal year. For the first quarter, we are anticipating a sequential decline in international revenues and margins due to the absence of these typical year-end seasonal activities, as well as seasonal weather-related weakness in the North Sea and Eurasia.  Now I'll highlight the segment results. Completion and Production revenue increased $330 million or 12% and operating income grew 13%, led by continued growth in our North America operations. Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis, North America revenue increased by 12%, while operating income grew by 13% from higher U.S. land and Canadian activity, combined with some pricing improvement. Halliburton continues to benefit from increased completions intensity from the development of unconventional resources.  In Latin America, Completion and Production revenue posted a 4% sequential increase in revenue, but operating income declined by 14%, as higher activity in Brazil and Colombia were offset by lower vessel activity and weather-related issues in Mexico. In Europe, Africa, CIS, Completion and Production revenue and operating income increased 18% and 29%, respectively. Higher activity levels in Norway, increased vessel utilization in West Africa and completion tool sales in Algeria partially offset project completions in the U.K. and lower activity in Nigeria and Russia. In Middle East/Asia, Completion and Production revenue and operating income increased by 10% and 4%, respectively, due to increased work in Iraq and higher completion tool sales in Asia. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income were up 8% and 10%, respectively, due to the year-end seasonality of higher Landmark and direct sales and increased activity in the North Sea, West Africa and across North Africa. These improvements were partially offset by the revenue decline in the Gulf of Mexico and Eurasia. In North America, Drilling and Evaluation's revenue was up 6%, but operating income declined by 1% as higher land activity was offset by the impact of the Gulf of Mexico. D&E experienced growth in the high-single digits for U.S. land as most of our product service lines continue to benefit from the 6% increase in horizontal drilling during the fourth quarter. Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income increased by 6% and 10%, respectively, due to increased software sales and fluids services across the region. In the Europe, Africa, CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income were up 8% and 11%, respectively, due to the recommencement of several projects in Algeria, higher activity in the North Sea, West Africa and Egypt, and increased software sales across the region. Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East/Asia revenues and operating income were up 14% and 24%, respectively, due to higher drilling activity in Iraq and increased direct sales in Asia. Our effective tax rate was 31% for the fourth quarter and 32% for the full year. With the current geographic and product line mix of our business, we expect our tax rate to be between 31% and 33% in 2011, consistent with our rate for 2010. On October 15, we retired $750 million of principal amount of our 5.5% senior notes with available cash and equivalents. This reduced our interest expense and we are projecting interest expense for 2011 to be about $67 million per quarter. And finally, as Dave mentioned earlier and as we alluded to in our Analyst Day presentations back in November, we're going to be making some additional investments in our business model throughout 2011 to lower our service delivery costs in North America and to reposition our supply chain, manufacturing and technology infrastructure to support our projected international growth. These investments include systems and consulting costs to upgrade our SAP, order to cash and purchase to pay capabilities, relocation and training costs for personnel and asset moves to international locations. We intend to separately highlight these investments for you as we go, but I currently expect the impact to be about $0.02 per share in the first quarter. Tim?
Timothy Probert: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Besides the sustainability of North America margins, there's wide interest in understanding the progress of the international recovery. Current international rig count is a little above 1,100, exceeding the prior peak of September 2008. Despite this, the pace of recovery is lagging that of past cycles, but revisiting previous international downturns provides some insight into the pace of this recovery. The length of this downturn coincides well with that of the 2001 to 2003 cycle, which spanned approximately five quarters. In that cycle, the company's revenues and those of the industry rebounded consistent with activity. This resulted in the company's international revenue per rig remaining stable throughout the 2001 cycle in contrast to the current cycle where the company's revenue per rig in the fourth quarter was approximately 8% below that of Q4 2008. The influence of the global financial crisis on the industry and its impact on services pricing is well understood. However, another contributory factor is the affect of activity mix in this downturn. In the 2001 cycle, land activity declined, but offshore rig count remained stable at around 225 rigs. This contrasts sharply with the current international cycle where the offshore rig count dropped by 12%, surpassing the 8% decline in land activity, and as of the end of December, the offshore count was only approaching the average of Q2 2008. Given the service intensity of offshore work, we believe this resulted in a more extensive impact on industry revenues, a more significant capacity overhang, and consequently, a more pronounced drop-off in pricing. In addition, 70% of the current international activity resurgence has been confined to five generally less service intensive countries: Argentina, Egypt, India, Colombia and Venezuela. Major markets like Mexico, Australia, Saudi and others have not yet fully recovered, which narrowed the scope of the recovery. However, as Dave mentioned, we're anticipating that the industry will experience steady volume increases in the coming year, leading to relative tightness of international equipment supply and a more positive outlook for improvement in pricing. We will support this with an acceleration of new technology introductions into current long-term contracts, now that value can be more easily extracted as activity improves. Dave?
David Lesar: Thank you, Tim, and let me just quickly summarize. North America remains strong and given our visibility and the continued growth in drilling and completions intensity, we believe that we can sustain revenue growth and margins in 2011. We'll see the typical drop off for our international revenues and margins in the first quarter. But beyond that, we continue to believe that volume increases will be steady and price competition will remain tough. And lastly, we ended up a year in a great position and we'll continue to leverage our expanded market position to benefit in what we see as a wonderful upcoming cycle. So let's go ahead and open it up for questions at this point.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
William Herbert - Simmons: With regard to trying to crystallize, if you will, your pretty sanitary outlook for North America in terms of a combination of pricing and service intensity leading to better margin resilience that maybe some can really appreciate. First of all, with regard to the percentage -- trying to get a sense as to how -- what percentage of your dedicated frac crews in the U.S. are basically committed for this year. I mean, effectively, are you completely sold out for this year or do you have significant swing capacity? Frame that for us, please.
David Lesar: Yes, Bill, I think that if you look at what we have now and what we have coming out, it is pretty well committed to the customer base that we want to work with. Now not all of it is committed under long-term contracts because we do want to see if there is additional upside in pricing that exists out there, and I do believe that there is. But we have committed the assets to certain customers, but we may not have completed the contract that would wraparound those set of assets.
William Herbert - Simmons: And then at this juncture -- I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but based upon your sort of conceptual framing of the opportunities and threats, if you will, for this year, it doesn't sound like as if you are expecting North America margins over the course of this year to actually weaken. Is that a correct statement?
David Lesar: That's correct statement.
William Herbert - Simmons: And then I've got one for Mark, and then I will hand it off. Mark, what percentage of the Eastern Hemisphere top line quarter-on-quarter was driven by year-end software direct and completion sales?
Mark McCollum: We don't typically give that kind of data, but I would say that it was very much in line with what we've seen historically.
William Herbert - Simmons: Well, we had about $215 million, I think, of Eastern Hemisphere top line revenue and yet, Dave, in the press release, pointed out several international markets which seemed to be improving intrinsically. Was it as much as a third of the quarter-on-quarter growth?
Mark McCollum: No, it's probably is higher than that, so maybe half.
Operator: Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with UBS.
Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: First question just on the North American margins for the fourth quarter which were 24%. Without the loss in the Gulf of Mexico with the completion of the Macondo relief efforts, what do you believe margins would have been in the fourth quarter for 2010?
David Lesar: Angie, we're not going to say that. They would have been higher, obviously, since we lost money in the Gulf of Mexico. But I think what we have found over the past several quarters, if we talk about our U.S. land margin, it becomes a target by which our competitors go after our pricing model. So just -- suffice it to say, obviously it was higher than the 24% that we had for our U.S. business.
Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: And when you think about the last soft cycle we had in North America 2008, 2009, Halliburton gained market share as the industry turned down. I believe price concessions were given more quickly by the smaller players. What would you expect -- if the market reaches that point this cycle, how does it play out?
David Lesar: Well, I think if it plays out that way, and as I said, we don't believe at least as it applies to Halliburton, that is a scenario that will play out in 2011. But if it did, I expect that it would have a very similar outcome in that because of our ability to integrate the fact that we are aligned with the customers that we believe will be the last to put rigs down, the ones that are more liquid or rich gas focused, that we would gain market share, and our pricing would come under pressure probably at the end of the line of the other pumping companies.
Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank: And then finally, on Iraq, obviously very good progress here in Q4 already. How do you see this evolving over 2011 and beyond?
David Lesar: I think, as I indicated in my comments, we've been successful winning work. As you know, we took an early approach of building bases and sending equipment into Iraq. There were some that criticized that at that point in time because we did not have rigs to sort of lead the efforts there. But I think with the work we've won and the results we're showing and the fact that we went from -- I believe, we had 14 employees at the beginning of 2010 and nearly 600 employees at the end of 2010 in Iraq, it shows that, I think, that strategy has worked and continues to work and we're very excited about our prospects there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Handler with Credit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: Could you please speak to, I guess, 2011 on a couple of different standpoints? If I think about what I feel like that we've heard this morning versus some of the messaging from your Analyst Day in November, it sounds like what was a bit more selective about growth prospects has broadened somewhat for 2011. So could you confirm that? And if so, maybe speak to -- help us think about from a top line growth in the Eastern Hemisphere, for example, what percentage growth might you be looking at now versus where you were, perhaps, thinking about back in November?
David Lesar: Yes. I think, Brad, I don't think it is inconsistent with what we talked about at our Analyst Day. We believe growth in the international markets will be led by deepwater and be led by unconventional gas in the long run. Currently, where we're seeing the activity increases is places like Algeria, like Iraq, which typically are land-based and are not deepwater and are not unconventionals. As I indicated, we do see activity increases happening throughout 2011. The big wild card is just how tough the pricing environment continues to be, and we'll just have to watch that and let it play out.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: Has there been some change in sentiment in conversations with your customers, given the move in oil prices in the last two or three months?
David Lesar: I mean, certainly, the contact level and inquiry level from customers about the availability of equipment, about the availability of resources has gone up. And I think the customer base is getting more convinced that the higher liquids prices are really here to stay and they need to move on with projects, so the discussions have increased. But remember, the international market is typically a tender-based market and it takes a while for those inquiries to turn into tenders, to turn into awards, to turn into work. So as I said, we are very, very bullish on the fact that we're coming into a big spending up cycle in the international market here. But I think people need to understand that it's not a matter of just picking up the phone and going to work. There's quite a process involved from the time you get the first inquiry to the time you bill your first revenue.
Brad Handler - Crédit Suisse AG: And related to that perhaps, but maybe not, you spoke of pretty significant CapEx in your Analyst Day. It sounds like you're filling that in for us here, but is the CapEx guidance of the $3 billion for 2011, is that maintained today?
Mark McCollum: Brad, this is Mark. We're still at that same number about -- we had said, I think, at Analyst Day, it would be $2.5 million to $3 million. And I think at this point, we anticipate it will be on the high end of that guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Jefferies & Company.
Stephen Gengaro - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: Two things. I guess the first, when we look at the next couple of quarters, I guess the first half of '11, should we expect the Gulf of Mexico loss to be about the same as it was in the first quarter, i.e., the impact on margins in NIM to be about where it was in 4Q?
David Lesar: No, I think that we have been successful winning some work on the shelf. We've been successful in redeploying some of those assets that did work on the Macondo relief well efforts. So I don't think that we would expect to lose money at the rate we did in Q3. Once the relief well effort was done, it just sort of fell off the wall and now we're in the process of redeploying. But we don't really see much happening in the first half of 2011 in the Gulf of Mexico. So I would say, I think we're expecting maybe a break even to a little bit of a loss over the next couple of quarters.
Stephen Gengaro - Jefferies & Company, Inc.: When we think about the well intensity and horsepower requirement issues in the U.S. and I know you talked a lot about this at your Analyst Day. When we think about sort of framing where margins can go in the North American land business versus prior upturns, any kind of commentary on that? Could it be better, the reasons it would be worse, how should we think about that?
Timothy Probert: Yes. I mean, certainly, as we continue to look at the North America market, service intensity continues to improve, we will continue to see the number of stages advance. And as that happens, that's obviously going to have an impact on the selection of service providers and it's also going to have an impact on potential margins. So I don't think we particularly want to opine too deeply on what margins can do. But is there continued potential to move margins? Yes, there is.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Anderson of JPMorgan.
John Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Dave, you mentioned the reinvention of your service delivery platform. And as it relates to really the kind of the pricing model that you talked about last quarter for your larger customers in dry gas basins, just wanted to know where that stands right now in terms of the uptake. Can you give us a sense of how big that business is right now? I mean is it like 5% of your North American business? Is it -- like how do you see that progressing, I guess, over the year?
David Lesar: I think the dry gas basin part of our business still is fairly large. We haven't abandoned that set of customers, but moving toward a business model that helps them reduce their costs and helps us reduce margins, we really were just tippy toeing into that in Q3. We've gotten a little more into it in Q4. I’ve had some further discussions with customers as late as last week on choosing places to implement it. But it's not a substantial piece of our business at this point in time.
John Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then last quarter we were talking about -- you had mentioned 3,200 wells or so uncompleted and I think last quarter, if I'm not mistaken, you said three to four months of equipment backlog in certain basins. Some of the E&Ps we've been hearing lately have been talking about really kind of capacity has been alleviated -- capacity should be alleviated in the Haynesville, but how does that now look in kind of the Bakken, Eagle Ford and some of the others? Are you still seeing that kind of backlog, and kind of how does that progress over the next couple of quarters in your mind?
David Lesar: Well, I think if you look at, again, the oil basins, liquid basins, like the Eagle Ford and the Bakken, you are still substantially backlogged on work and there is not enough equipment in those markets. I think that we are seeing some rigs start to leave the Haynesville, but they're going directly to the Eagle Ford to go to work. So yes, there is the number of wells in inventory is set up as a high range of where we thought it would be. As I indicated, we believe it will go up even more in Q1, which I think Dave indicates to you that there's still an imbalance between the ability to get to that work with the available horsepower versus the rate the wells are being drilled at.
John Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And one last question, on your CleanSuite of frac-ing services, obviously it's a response to some of the criticism the industry has faced. How does the performance stack up and does this work better in some plays than others? And I guess I would assume the -- probably the pricing would be higher here. Am I wrong on that?
Timothy Probert: Dave, this is Tim. A couple of points there. Firstly, CleanSuite has performed extremely well. It is essentially a very clean system, free of impurities. And as a result of that, the IPs that we've seen from the wells which we’ve treated have been particularly attractive. So that's a very good piece of news for us in terms of the introduction of the technology. And secondly, yes, as you would expect, we want to ensure that we attract the pricing for that, which is consistent with a) the performance and b) clearly, this is a more expensive system than that, that would just be traditionally used. But we believe that the benefits are quite significant.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery with Tudor, Pickering.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering: Could you guys update us just on your outlook for Russia, kind of how contract rollover progress has occurred, and just qualitatively discuss how pricing is progressing in that market?
Timothy Probert: Yes. I think that with Russia in 2011, you've got just two things going on. First of all, in Sakhalin you're going to see some declines in activity, and the service intensity there in Sakhalin is very high. So the decline in Sakhalin activity does have an overall impact in subduing the overall growth in Russia. But the progress of the bidding process in Q4 has proceeded well. We expect to see a continued advance in both Western and Eastern Siberia in 2011.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering: And is pricing at a point where it allows margin expansion or just to offset inflation?
Timothy Probert: I think, like everywhere in the international markets, pricing is challenging. I would say it's particularly most challenging, I believe, in the pressure pumping arena. There's clearly some oversupply in that market which continues, and I would say that's probably in terms of overall pricing impact, that's probably the area which is the least attractive of all the offerings that we have in Russia.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering: Just Algeria was mentioned on the positive side of the ledger for both segments in the fourth quarter. How would you characterize that market going forward? Is it closer to being business as usual? Or just how would you characterize it?
David Lesar: This is Dave. I was just in there last week, so let me comment on that. It's not business as usual yet. I think that some of the lack of decision-making process that was necessitated by the change in management is getting in the rear view mirror at this point in time. The IPM rigs are starting to come back to work which is good for the industry and good for us, and there's a lot of potential work being bid in there. So it's slowed down dramatically. It's stayed down much longer than the industry thought it would. It's being lead back out by sort of the IPM efforts, and we would expect then that sort of the normal service efforts of Sonatrach and the other IOCs that are in there should give it an additional boost as we go through the next year or so.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Boyd with Goldman Sachs.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: Dave, I'm trying to just understand how to think about Eastern Hemisphere margin progression from here and just recognizing there will be the seasonality in 1Q. So if we were to just strip out the benefit from the product sales that you got in 4Q, was there an underlying improvement in the margins?
Timothy Probert: Yes. This is Tim, Dan. Yes, there was an underlying improvement in margins x the direct sale component.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: And then on the inquiry front, what you're hearing from customers, recognizing that it takes some time before you actually see it in activity, has there been a change in the mix of inquiries you're getting? Are they moving more towards offshore, are you seeing an interest in exploration picking up, and how do you think that progresses through the first half in 2011?
David Lesar: Well, I think, with respect to the inquiries, I would say they're focused in three areas: exploration, unconventional gas and sort of deepwater development. And how I would see that progressing is inquiries will turn into sort of statements of work, will turn into tenders and will turn into awards. But given the fact that the IOCs which tend to drive the deepwater market generally have to deal with NOC partners in most of these locations, that sort of cycle from inquiry to award sometimes does take a lot longer than all of us would like.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: So it's a more of a back half of the year event than it sounds like?
David Lesar: Yes, I would think so.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: When it comes to the international shale or unconventional opportunity that you've highlighted a couple of times, could you just discuss a little bit the start-up costs involved and also in the new regions? So is this going to be a slight drag on profits as you build up? And when do you, let's say, expect profitability to benefit from infrastructure leverage and get sort of North American style margins?
Timothy Probert: Ole, this is Tim. I mean clearly, we benefit in North America from scale, a substantial amount of scale. And where we are specifically with shale gas developments as opposed to other unconventionals, specifically with shale gas right now, is we're really in the exploration phase and that exploration phase is in multiple areas. As you heard Dave talk earlier, we talked about our first shale activity in Mexico. I think on the last quarter's call, Dave talked about the first shale well, which has been stimulated in Poland, for example, so that continues. But very much large acreage positions by a number of our customers. They're trying to assess those acreage positions and really understand how they can apply sort of full-scale factory-type activities to those plays. So yes, we will see a slower ramp up. And the amount of hydraulic horsepower in the Eastern Hemisphere or I should say in the international markets is probably only about 25% of that existing in North America. So the overall ability to move rapidly is going to be a function of pulling together equipment to exploit these areas. And I think it's reasonable to expect that our customers will be working closely with us to try and put together packages, which whilst they may not be necessarily optimal for the long term, give an opportunity to really better understand the potential productivity of these plays.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: So if you think about the scale, clearly a lot of press releases coming out at the moment for the risks of China, or whatever it is, how should we think about this year relative to, let's say, a very vibrant recovery potentially in Norway or in the U.K. or some of the more classic high margin basins?
Timothy Probert: As I say, they really are in the exploration phase right now, so we've got to go from the exploration phase through into a full-scale development, which is going to take multiple quarters for us to get to that point.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim West with Barclays Capital.
James West - Barclays Capital: Dave, I was particularly interested in the announcement of this major reinvestment and capacity expansion in the Eastern Hemisphere. It's obviously a clear bullish signal on the cycle. What are the key steps in your process, the time line, the CapEx required? And once you're completed here, how will your infrastructure compare to that of your closest competitor?
Mark McCollum: Jim, this is Mark. I'll try to talk more generally about it. The major capital cost will be the build out of technology centers and manufacturing capacity in some locations in the Eastern Hemisphere, particularly in Asia, that we're embarking on this year. And the capital investment will be a couple of hundred million dollars probably this year. It will spill over probably into 2012 as well in order to finish that capacity. That's the major thing that we'll be doing. In terms of being -- other infrastructure, we're already in 70 countries around the world. I mean, it's not a significantly different infrastructure investment that we'll need to make other than what will reflect just the growth in our business over the next couple of years. But the technology center, the manufacturing centers and the completion of those will -- capital investment will fall largely into this year, and then we’ll be training and moving people as we go through the year. So that we'll try to have them fully staffed as we move out of 2011 and into 2012. Simultaneously, we're going to be making some investments in transaction centers in Latin America and Asia, training people there. We're working on SAP. We've got consultants with Accenture and others helping us on supply chain and our purchase-to-pay and order-to-cash process here at North America. So all of these activities are going to be going on simultaneously to try to help us be the lowest-cost service provider wherever we work, not just here in North America, but also around the world.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: So I'm curious on the international pricing front, I know it's not a story that's new necessarily. About prior cycles, you typical couldn't get international pricing and international markets couldn't be strong without the U.S. markets necessarily being strong as well. We're now a couple of years as you have mentioned into a cycle recovery and just wondering where the excess capacity resides right now within the industry. Maybe you can give us some general sense on that from a product line standpoint and potentially from a geographic standpoint as well.
Timothy Probert: Well, just as a general statement, obviously, a change in activity is really important to moving pricing. But more importantly, it's the rate of that change, right? When things move very slowly, it gives everyone a chance to respond. When things move a little bit more quickly, then the overcapacity disappears quite quickly and pricing power returns back to the service sector. And we couple that, obviously with introductions of new technology, particularly into longer-term contracts which we, I think generally as an industry, probably have been a little loathe to do in the midst of a downturn are now starting to move those technologies into the market as we can get better value for them as activity recovery improves. But to -- specifically with respect to any particular overhang, I don't think that there are any particular markets where you could point to and sort of say, gosh, there's an enormous amount of overcapacity here or there. Most of the equipment in this industry tends to be relatively mobile given a quarter or so of time passing. So I think it's just general capacity in the system; no specific areas, Kurt, that I would point to.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: And then my follow-up would generally be that as you go down this path on increasing your presence internationally, and you stated at your Analyst Day what your commitments were obviously for deepwater and other international arenas, just curious as to how we could characterize Halliburton on the international market from a flagship product line or flagship service standpoint? Obviously, in the U.S., your flagship is frac. What do you see Halliburton's flagship being as you embark on this international plan over the next five-year period?
Timothy Probert: Well, clearly, the nature of the international markets are led by Drilling and Evaluation capabilities. As unconventionals become more important, then we'll see perhaps a little more balance in the international markets return. But for us, Drilling and Evaluation is the big driver for us in our Eastern Hemisphere and international markets. Couple that together with our completions expertise and as Mark was talking about a little bit earlier, that's one of the key areas of focus for us for our investment in the Eastern Hemisphere with a very strong position in completions, particularly deepwater completions and we intend to capitalize on that in 2011 and beyond.
Operator: Our final question comes from Waqar Syed with Macquarie.
Waqar Syed - Macquarie Research: Dave, could you quantify for us the number of rigs that may be working internationally today on these unconventional wells where the pressure pumping requirements may be similar to some of the -- in the 15,000- to 20,000-horsepower kind of range that you see in the Barnett and other places?
Timothy Probert: This is Tim, Waqar. I would say that generally speaking, there are very, very few dedicated fleets that sort of are in, the sort of 40,000-horsepower range. Fleets internationally tend to be much smaller, so what it tends to mean, generally speaking, to execute some of these unconventional plays, it’s typically a gathering of a couple of fleets together to execute. That's going to change and it's going to change quite quickly. But the historical norm and the situation particularly during the exploration phase has been not, to this point, to have a significant number of 40,000-plus horsepower spreads which are dedicated to that kind of activity.
Waqar Syed - Macquarie Research: But even at a smaller level, let's say, 20,000-horsepower which was kind of some of the early unconventional well requirements in the U.S., if we go to that level would you say, what, 10, 15 rigs would be working outside of North America right now in that kind of range?
Timothy Probert: I'm afraid I don't have a good number for you in terms of the number of dedicated rigs. Again, as I say, we're kind of in an exploration phase specifically with shale, so it's probably going to be somewhere less than a dozen, yes.
David Lesar: Let me just add one thing. That would not include what might be going on in Russia and China at this point in time, where I think there's less visibility into the number of rigs that may be working. I think that the number Tim alluded to, if you take a look at sort of the plays where we have a much better view of what the rig count is and where the rigs are working, I would say that's a good number. But we know that there is shale gas drilling going on in China today by the Chinese companies and I don't think anybody has got a handle on the number of rigs that may be doing that kind of work.
Timothy Probert: Yes, I think we should also specifically exclude CBM and tight gas applications. We're just talking about shales here.
Waqar Syed - Macquarie Research: And the wells that are being drilled currently, is the horsepower requirement there closer to the Haynesville-type wells or more like the Barnett?
David Lesar: No, there are still -- the wells that are being drilled today, as Tim said, are mainly the exploration kinds of wells and you don't have the long laterals on them yet. They're basically drilling either vertical wells or vertical with small laterals, so it really isn't taking a lot of horsepower to frac those things right now and usually it can get by with 10,000 to 12,000 horsepower.
Christian Garcia: So before we close, we'd like to announce that our Q1 2011 Earnings Call will be held on Monday, April 18th, at 9 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Central. Sean, let's close it out.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.

===== 2010 Q3  (2010-10-18 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Christian Garcia – Investor Relations David Lesar – Chief Executive Officer Mark McCollum – Chief Financial Officer Tim Probert – President, Global Business Lines and Corporate Development

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to Halliburton Third Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Christian Garcia.
Christian Garcia: Thank you, Sean. Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2010 conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and the replay will be available on Halliburton’s website for seven days. The press release announcing the third quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are David Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Global Business Lines and Corporate Development. In today’s call, Dave will provide opening remarks, Mark will discuss our overall financial performance and liquidity position, and Tim will provide comments on our operations. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. I would like to remind our audience that some of today’s comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release announcing the third quarter results. Note that we will be using the term international to refer to our operations outside the U.S. and Canada, and we will refer to the combination of U.S. and Canada as North America. Dave?
David Lesar: Thank you, Christian, and good morning to everyone. We had another strong quarter. Our results, which by the way played out very close to how we thought they would, reflected the continuing strengthening of our North America business, as well as international market that basically treaded water in the third quarter. Revenues of $4.7 billion, represented a 30% increase over the prior year as we leveraged our balanced geographic portfolio to successfully counteract the negative Q3 impact of several significant markets, like the Gulf of Mexico, Algeria and Mexico, where we believe that business conditions for most service companies were significantly worse than the second quarter, which of course, put pressure downward on our earnings. Operating income grew 73% from the prior year, lead by a more than 10 fold increase in North American profitability. Let me provide some more details starting with North America. North America had another outstanding quarter, sequential revenue and operating income increasing 13% and 30%, respectively, out pacing the U.S. rig count growth of 7%. Incremental margins for the third quarter were 49% and North America margins increased to 24%, and we achieved this performance despite the very negative impact on revenue, operating income and incremental margins from the significant decline in our Gulf of Mexico business. The continued growth in overall activity and corresponding increase in completions intensity provided us with an incremental opportunity to adjust pricing across all of our product service lines, lead of course by production enhancement. Fracturing prices have continued to rise since the fourth quarter of 2009, but remember are still below 2008 levels. However, overall fracturing revenue per well has expanded driven by more complex stimulation treatments. It is important to recognize that by taking a leadership position and setting fracturing pricing, we likely got an initial jump in our competition in terms of margin performance in the second quarter and we believe that we’ve been able to maintain this leadership throughout Q3. The shift to oil and liquids-rich plays has been persistent, stood by stable oil prices. We believe that this shift will continue as evidenced by operator interest in acquiring additional acreage in the oil and condensate basins that have out paced the dry gas regions. We anticipate that incremental capital spending will continue to drive increased rig counts in oil, in liquids-rich plays like the Eagle Ford, Niobrara, Granite Wash, Bone Springs and other emerging basins in the Permian Basin over the next year and we are, of course, well positioned in these plays. However, natural gas fundamentals remain weak and we believe will exert downward pressure on those dry gas directing and -- completion basins in the coming quarters. We strongly and continue to believe strongly in the long-term prospects of the North market. Our footprint and integrated offerings give us a unique ability to experiment with new business models, customized to meet a wide range of customer economic thresholds. In certain dry gas basins, we are strategically working with a number of our key customers to improve their project economics by utilizing our drilling optimization technologies and workflows to drive a decrease in their total overall drilling and completion costs. For these customers, at the same time we are also moderating our price increases as we implement this model and are also committing to not move equipment from them to other locations to chase higher pricing. While this approach does not optimize short-term revenues or returns, we believe it is important to stick with our loyal and key customers in this low dry gas environment and to work together to build a long-term market stability. We believe this effort has the potential to reduce the number of rigs our key customers may have to lay down in response to any future weakness in natural gas prices. Our objective has been and will be to defend our market position by deploying sufficient capital to protect and sustain the strong performance of our North America business over the coming years. Our strategy is to align our business and equipment with those operators who value the efficiencies and optimization we can deliver through our full suite of capabilities to generate optimal long-term project returns for both our customers and ourselves. Going forward despite the potential weakness we see in natural gas fundamentals, we believe our North America revenue and margins are sustainable through 2011 due to the following factors. First, we estimate that oil and liquids-rich plays, which we believe are more sustainable now support almost 60% of the U.S. rig count and should continue to provide an offset to any reduction in dry gas activity, moderating the typical market volatility associated with the North American market. Secondly, completions intensity has grown dramatically over the last year and can also assist in the absorption of any new pressure pumping capacity. We have seen our horsepower requirements per job increase by over 50% in the last two years, while the number of hours that the equipment has utilized per well has also doubled. Additionally, we are seeing that the successful horizontal drilling and stimulation techniques that we are using to exploit unconventional gas activities are now being transferred and applied to both conventional and unconventional oil plays. Tim will talk about this a little bit in a few minutes. We anticipate that there will also be 2500 to 3000 uncompleted wells by the end of the year, driven by the requirements to drill wells to hold leases. This also can provide some stability to ongoing completions work for some time even in the lower rig environment. Further, we believe that this backlog could continue to build if rig count does not moderate and if income and pressure pumping capacity is added ratably over the next nine to 12 months. We also believe that a meaningful proportion of the expected pressure pumping capacity adds will be used to address increased horsepower maintenance requirements and the accelerated replacement and retirement cycles due to the hard use of equipment. As an example, over 10% of our fleet at any time is undergoing maintenance, therefore reducing our available capacity. This percentage has doubled in the last few years and we believe that Halliburton’s percentage of fleet down at any point in time remains lower than the rest of the industries. And finally, interest and development of unconventional resources internationally is also growing significantly. In contrast to North America, international unconventional resources are highly undercapitalized from an equipment standpoint, despite having estimated reserves three times the size of North America. We believe that Halliburton will meaningfully benefit from the emergence of these resources due to our global infrastructure and differentiated technical expertise. These factors all provide us confidence on our revenue and margin position in light of the influx of new capacity. However, this activity significantly declines, one significant advantage we have over most of our competitors is that we build our own equipment and therefore control its flow into the market. I want to tell you today that if we continue to stay laser focused on creating the highest returns for our shareholders, so our fracking activities significantly declines or we see margins come under significant pressure, we would look at immediately adjusting our build of pressure pump. Our Gulf of Mexico business declined sharply in the third quarter due to the impact of the drilling suspension. We were helped by our work on the Macondo relief wells. This work is now completed. In the fourth quarter, despite the lifting of the moratorium we anticipate even further deterioration of our Gulf of Mexico business. We continue to believe that Gulf activity will remain restrained as operators adjust to the new regulations. Today, we’ve transferred approximately 400 of our personnel from the Gulf of Mexico to other regions in the U.S. and around the world. I’m pleased to also say that we’ve hired 6,000 -- over 6,600 new employees in the U.S. since the beginning of the year, creating a significant number of new U.S. jobs. Let’s now turn to the international business and start with Latin America. Latin America experienced flat sequential revenue and lower operating income as robust growth in several countries was offset by significant decline in Mexico’s results. Brazil continues to be a bright spot and to grow significantly with revenue increasing 20% from the prior year. We also saw strengthen the Andean countries and in addition, the outlook for increased opportunities in Venezuela is improving as our customer focuses on that countries productions challenges. However, the Mexico market continues to disappoint me from month-to-month. During the third quarter our business was impacted by PEMEX’s suspension of drilling activity in the Chicana-Pac region, as well as severe flooding in the southern region, we have been working on three rigs on our southern alliance IPM project. We have now completed the transfer of excess capital equipment to other countries and adjusted our cost structure as appropriate to level of work available in the Mexico market for the coming quarters. Our operations in Mexico declined 12% sequentially with a corresponding sharp [decremental] margins. Our Mexico operations took a further P&L hit by severance and rig cancellation costs in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter our Mexico operations will continue to be impacted as we have not yet fully returned to work on our alliance project in Southern Mexico due to the flooding. There’s also speculation that drilling at Chicana Pac may restart toward the end of the year. However, given the low level of returns we generate on that project, as well as the uncertainty and the timing and scope of the work, we are evaluating whether or not we will participate going forward. Giving these lingering issues in Mexico, we do not anticipate meaningful improvement in our Latin business in the coming quarter. Now, let’s look at the Eastern Hemisphere. As expected, we experienced flat sequential results for our overall international business due to uneven growth across several geographies. We had strong double-digit revenue increases in the U.K., Russia, China and parts of Southeast Asia that were offset by significant project delays in Algeria, lower activity in Norway and low vessel utilization rates. We did see operating margins increase in some of our product service lines in the third quarter, but they were offset by poor margins in production enhancement. It is the product service line most impacted by low vessel utilization and the project delays that I mentioned. We announced three key wins in Iraq for a combination of new drilling and workover wells for Shell Majnoon, Eni in Zubair and Exxon West Qurna. We began the second phase of our base in Barge Sea with all of our product service lines now currently operating in Iraq. These new contract wins represent the first step in having profitable operations in Iraq by Mid 2011. However, we continued to incur significant start-up costs in the third quarter which obviously impacted our Eastern Hemisphere margins and this will continue for the next several quarters. We anticipate that we will see the typical sequential improvement in our international revenues and margins in Q4 due to seasonal year end increases for landmark, completion tools and direct sales for wireline and other equipment. Beyond the fourth quarter, we believe that global oil demand and growth will continue to show moderate recovery in international volume growth for the oil field services, and although, this will be positive we also believe it will be steady. In past cycles, the overall rig count rebounded from trough levels to prior peak levels in about four quarters but is limited to only a few select countries. This is consistent with the behavior of the current international cycle where five countries represented 70% of the rig count increase since the prior trough. We expect that activity improvements across the broader international market in 2011 will eventually lead to meaningful absorption of the excess equipment that that is out there and as the international rig count increases, more evenly across multiple geographies, this will enable international pricing to show improvement during 2011. However in the interim, international margins may progressively improve but we don’t believe the incrementals will be great as they are likely to be volume lead rather than price driven in the near-term. Longer term, we continue to believe that the global economic recovery will accelerate leading to global oil and gas demand in 2012 to exceed its prior peak experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007. If this occurs we expect a significant reduction in the industry’s spare production capacity leading to increased reliance in finding and developing new sources of hydrocarbons, a scenario that bodes well for Halliburton. So we continue to be very pleased with the strength of our balanced geographic and technology portfolios, several international markets are in a state of repair. Accordingly our plan during this period of transition is to continue to utilize our broad global capabilities to successfully defend our market position, continue to generate growth and improve our margins. Let me turn it over to Mark for some more detail.
Mark McCollum: Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Let me provide you with our third quarter financial highlights. Our revenue in the third quarter was $4.7 billion, up 6% from the second quarter and 30% from the prior year. Total operating income for the third quarter was $818 million, up 7% from the previous quarter. Our results included a non-cash charge of approximately $50 million to write-down our residual interest in the Sangu oil and gas project in Bangladesh. This legacy project started in 1996 and has overall been profitable for us. However, we’ve decided not to make any further investments in drilling the property and will likely exit our operating interest. International revenue was flat and operating income was down slightly in the third quarter, comparing the second quarter, excluding the non-cash charge. As declines in slight major markets like Mexico, Norway and Algeria offset strong growth in the U.K., China and parts of Southeast Asia. As Dave said earlier, we anticipate a sequential improvement in the fourth quarter driven by landmark, completion tools and direct sales of wireline and other equipment. Typically, international revenues and income have increased by the mid single digits from Q3 to Q4 related to these year end activities. As a result, we would then expect to see a sequential decline in international revenues and margins in the first quarter as these activities subside coupled with weather related seasonality. For North America, margins in the third quarter increased from the prior quarter due to strong activity and improved pricing across most basins. This was partially offset by the decline in our Gulf of Mexico business. To reiterate Dave’s earlier comment, we anticipate a further reduction in our Gulf of Mexico business in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we expect to see the typical moderation of our U.S. land results in the fourth quarter due to weather related seasonality in the Rockies in the Northeast U.S. Now I’ll highlight the segment results. I’ll be comparing our third quarter results sequentially to the second quarter of 2010 and I will be excluding the impact of the Q3 non-cash charge on operating income. Completion and Production revenue increased $262 million or 11% and operating income grew 23% due to the strength of our North America operations. Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis, North America revenue increased by 19%, while operating income grew by 48% from better activity and pricing. Halliburton benefited significantly from the continuing shift to oil and liquids-rich basins with increasing completions intensity. In Latin America Completion and Production revenue and operating income declined by 2% and 18% respectively, as the curtailment of activity in Mexico was partially offset by increased sand control revenues in Brazil. In Europe, Africa, CIS Completion and Production revenue and operating income decreased 5% and 23% respectively, with lower vessel utilization, lower activity and completion sales in Scandinavia, project delays in Algeria and the conclusion of a project in Congo offsetting increased activity in the U.K. In Middle East/Asia, Completion and Production posted a 6% sequential increase in revenue but operating income declined 14% as higher completion tool sales in China were offset primarily by reduced activity and mobilization costs for production enhancement in India and reduced activity in Southeast and Central Asia. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income were essentially flat with the prior quarter due to uneven growth across several geographies. In North America, Drilling and Evaluations revenue was flat but operating income declined by 12% as the drilling suspension in the Gulf of Mexico impacted this division disproportionately. D&E experienced double-digit growth for U.S. land as most of our product service lines continued to benefit from the 13% increase in horizontal drilling during the second quarter. Drilling and Evaluations Latin America revenue was flat but operating income declined by 11% as lower overall activity in Mexico and a decrease in testing activity in Brazil was offset by strong activity in Columbia and Ecuador. In the Europe, Africa, CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue was flat but operating income was up 25% as higher activity in the U.K., Russia and Angola offset an unfavorable product services mix in Norway and delays in Algeria. Drilling and Evaluations Middle East/Asia revenues and operating income were up by $25 million and $12 million, respectively, due to higher drilling activity in Asia. Corporate expenses were $62 million this quarter due to a few pension adjustments and higher legal costs. We expect the higher legal costs to continue for a while which will result in corporate expenses for the coming quarters to be in the range of $55 to $60 million per quarter. This quarter’s effective income tax rate was 34%, which was higher than our previous guidance. The rate though was impacted by an $11 million charge related to our reevaluation of the potential outcome on a pending tax case in Eurasia. We do however now anticipate that our overall effective tax rate for the fourth quarter will be in the range of 33% to 34% given the higher proportion of domestic income for the year. We bought approximately 3.5 million shares back toward the end of the quarter. This amount was sufficient to offset the dilution from the Boots & Coots transaction in mid September. And finally, we expect 2010 capital expenditures to inch up to $2.1 billion. We’ll be presenting our 2011 capital expenditure plan to our Board at the end of the year and will provide guidance on next years capital plan in our fourth quarter call. Tim?
Tim Probert: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. The ship to oil and liquids-rich plays has been a persistent trend with profound implications on the shape of activity growth in North America. This shift is perhaps best manifested by the expansion of the Eagle Ford. Transaction values for land acquisition in this basin have exceeded $7 billion over the last seven months, underscoring our customer’s great interest in this type of play. Meanwhile, the rig count has grown from approximately 40 rigs at the beginning of the year to over 100 currently. Halliburton continues to lead the industry in the efficient development of tools, technology and expertise necessary to help our customers develop complex plays like the Eagle Ford. Here, they range from relatively shallow oil sections to deep, high pressure, high temperature dry gas reservoirs with temperatures over 300 degrees and pressures over 10,000 PSI. Understanding reservoir attributes and applying these premium technologies has allowed us to develop a track record, which has delivered top quartile production performance for Eagle Ford customers, while providing increased levels of service intensity across Halliburton’s portfolio. Productivity improvement is evident in other oily basins, in the Bakken several operators are drilling 6,000 foot laterals with 30 plus frac stages. This compares to wells drilled two years ago with 2000-foot laterals in eight stages and has resulted in material improvements in well productivity. In the Permian horizontal rig count has grown dramatically and already represents approximately 16% of total rigs working in that basin as plays like the Bone Springs, Wolfberry and Avalon emerge. We believe the migration of unconventional techniques towards the development of conventional oil will support well stimulation demand in North America. The ship to liquids-rich and oily basins has an impact on service intensity, while construction activities, notably directional drilling, fluids and bits are favorably impacted by the growth in horizontal drilling, which is now 55% of total activity. From a stimulation standpoint, an oily basin such as the Bakken is today about 20% more service intensive than the liquids-rich Eagle Ford. However, completion schemes are of course evolving rapidly basin-to-basin. Dave?
David Lesar: Thanks, Tim. Let me just quickly summarize and then we’ll turn it open for questions. First of all for North America, the shift into oil and liquids-rich plays is going to lead to continued growth in overall activity for our U.S. land business. This will lead to further price improvements and higher utilization rates. Going forward we believe that the growth of these plays and corresponding service intensity remain opportunities for us and will serve to support the increase in demand for oil field services. Internationally the flat recovery we are experiencing today is consistent with the behavior of prior cycles. Going forward, we believe that volume increases will be steady but measured which will eventually lead to a meaningful absorption of equipment supply and giving us some pricing power some time in 2011. We obviously remain very bullish about the long-term prospects of our business. Our third quarter results reflect what we believe to be a very successful execution of our strategy in securing our key objectives of above average growth, margin and returns for our shareholders. Let’s go ahead and open it up for questions now, Christian.
Christian Garcia: Okay. Before we open it up for questions we would like to remind everyone that we would like to limit each caller to one question and one follow-up to accommodate as many callers as possible. Sean?
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Angie Sedita with UBS.
Angie Sedita – UBS: Great. Nice quarter, Dave, particularly in North America.
David Lesar: Thank you.
Angie Sedita – UBS: Dave, could you walk us through your thoughts on the margin progression in North America going forward? Could you see even margin improvements in a potentially flat rig market?
David Lesar: Yeah. I think the – yeah, it’s a good question and one we debate internally all the time. The short answer is yeah, we do. Remember one of the things I said is that pricing is not yet to the 2008 levels. Now, I’m not going to give you a margin goal because I think for competitive reasons, we don’t want to put it out there. But the reality is with the move to more oily, more liquids-rich plays, the efficiencies that we’re doing, some of these new business model opportunities we have with customers bearing fruit, I think that there still is juice in the pricing game going forward into 2011.
Angie Sedita – UBS: Okay. Very, very helpful. And then as a follow-up, just following along with pricing, you mentioned that you could see pricing, some potential pricing strength in 2011 internationally in a few select regions. Could you give us some color there?
David Lesar: Sure. I think that as I indicated, if you look at the rig count growth internationally although its been pretty good, it really was concentrated in five countries. And we see rig count coming up in other parts across the world. Algeria continued in Q3 to be a problem area for us and I think for the industry. And we see some signs that that is stabilizing at this point in time. Iraq, for us I think, should contribute some profitability as we get into 2011. And I think that will help because right now, we’re essentially incurring costs and next year, I think we will reap the benefits of that. So I would say that if you look to the offshore markets, West Africa, Brazil, places like that, I think that’s where you’ll see capacity absorbed and there for the ability to increase margins.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brad Handler with Credit Suisse.
Brad Handler – Credit Suisse: Thanks guys. Good morning.
David Lesar: Hi, Brad.
Brad Handler – Credit Suisse: Would you -- a couple unrelated ones. Could you give us a little bit more sort of quantifying the impact of the Gulf of Mexico in your business in the quarter? The revenue hit for example, margin hit?
Mark McCollum: Hi, Brad. This is Mark. You know, we had initially guided that the moratorium would impact us by about $0.05 to $0.08 per quarter, that, you know, that was coming off of a numbers that we had looked at on a historical basis. Subsequently, I think about a month ago we had indicated that because of our work on the relief wells, we were expecting that this quarter’s impact would be at the low end of that range. I think for competitive reasons we aren’t going to give any specifics today except to just suffice it to say that the results came in as we expected that they would. For Q4, I think the best guidance we can give you is that the range is still relevant. Again, it’s looking back at historical performance but that range is still relevant but we do expect that we will be higher in the range than we were in at Q3.
Brad Handler – Credit Suisse: Okay. Makes sense and thank you, that is helpful. And then maybe we could dive into the West African market a little bit, maybe to help to illustrate just some of the sluggishness that we’ve seen in activity. And I guess you have some confidence that the Angola market, for example, picks up but what -- do you have a better handle for example, on what has caused some of that sluggishness in activity and maybe that helps us get confident in how that’s going to start to turn and how that process works?
David Lesar: Yeah. I think -- this is Dave. A couple of things, the two big countries that drive West Africa are, of course, Angola and Nigeria. And we had won a significant amount of work in Angola earlier this year and have been basically in mobilization mode on that, especially in our drilling PSL and that work was really slow to get off the ground. But we start now -- we’re starting now to see the rigs get there, the work is starting and a lot of the mobilization costs are behind us. Nigeria is a bit of a different story in that although its been steady. It can be a good deepwater market and there are a number of projects that look like they are finally going to get off the ground but again, it’s more an absorption of capacity. Those are two countries where we have a very high cost base and you need to have a certain amount of scope and work to be able to cover that cost base. And over the past several quarters, we really haven’t had the volume of business to absorb that high-cost structure but we see that perhaps that is starting to change.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital: Hi, good morning.
David Lesar: Hi, Kurt.
Mark McCollum: Hi, Kurt.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital: Yeah. Just what I wanted to get a general sense first on Tim, you mentioned $7 billion in investment in the last seven months. I don’t know if I quite picked up on whether or not you were referring to the -- all the unconventional plays in U.S. or handful of different unconventional plays. And more importantly, do you think that the pace of investment is plateaued, do you think it is peaked or do you think it will continue to accelerate from here?
Tim Probert: The example that I was giving, Kurt, was the Eagle Ford and I was just picking it out as an example because there clearly has been a lot of activity there. And so the sort of 7 billion range relates to the transactions, which have been consummated there or at least announced there over the course of the last seven or eight months. But obviously, there are a lot of other transactions and a -- lot of other transactions and a lot of other oily basins too which I don’t have those details to hand. So to answer your question, we clearly are seeing the shift. We’re clearly seeing a significant amount of investment in these plays. And the data does not seem to suggest that it’s slowing down in any way. So we definitely believe that we’re going to see a continuation of that trend, including the sort of the joint venture type activity which brings if you like non-north America capital to play.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital: Okay. And then as a follow-up, Dave for you in the context of what’s going on with the natural gas technology and the service intensity and so on and so forth, I mean, would you be willing to venture a guess that the cost structure of the industry is going to be forced to come down such that we might not be seeing a $8 or $10 Mcf kind of natural gas environment, instead the operators will actually find, they will have the opportunity to make an economic process at $4 to $5 natural gas longer term? What’s your take on that?
David Lesar: I think you are right. The customers, I talk to, are really starting to do a lot of scenario planning in sort of the $3 to $5 range for a period of time. And that’s one of the reasons that we are starting to experiment with some of these new business models and it’s not a model that just flattens down service prices. It’s a model that optimizes the drilling, the completion cycle, the data, the information cycle and allows our customers to make a return and allows us to make a return. But clearly it plays into one of the strengths we have, which is our ability to integrate together a wide range of capabilities which I think certain of our competitors are not going to be able to do. So I think that the dry gas basins, it’s in everybody’s interest. I think U.S. national security, our customer base, the environmental impact, it’s in everyone’s best interest to figure out a way to make the dry gas basins play out and produce and be profitable for everybody at a lower natural gas price and that’s our goal. And I’m confident that we can help our customers accomplish that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Crandell with Barclays.
Jim Crandell – Barclays: Good morning.
David Lesar: Hi, Jim.
Mark McCollum: Hi, Jim.
Jim Crandell – Barclays:  I have a couple questions about Iraq. We have a potential market unfolding that could be five to 10 billion over time and probably very good margins for everyone. You bid very aggressively by all counts to win three significant projects. I guess, two questions in regard to that. Number one, your competition says project will get rebid after the first year so there’s no real advantage in winning them at what they call breakeven to a loss. I know, you said you bid in the skinny margin so let’s just say breakeven? And then secondly, to get strong returns over time, it would seem you have to walk up prices significantly and does that whole task become a lot tougher given that you bid so low to win these first group of contracts?
David Lesar: I think, I guess, Jim, I’ll take a couple of issue. I don’t know what our competitors are saying because they obviously don’t say them to us, they say them to you. But I guess I would take issue with a couple of things. One, we believe that there is a first mover advantage in new markets and we want to be one of those first movers and therefore, we are bidding and winning work. We are establishing our capabilities on the ground, we are building a reputation within, not only the IOC customer base but the national oil companies that are watching the western service companies come in there. Two, one of the things that we have experienced is it takes a long time to bid and get a tender approved. And so I think that our view is by being on the ground, by working, that we have the opportunity to extend some of these contracts beyond their initial term because of the difficulties that a number of our customers have in getting things up and going. And three, I think that by building the critical mass, by being the first mover in terms of an advantage, by having all of our product lines on the ground, we will have a lower breakeven point than maybe those competitors that believe they can walk in later and that’s our strategy and we’re sticking with it. And I believe it’s going to pay off for us in the long run.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery with Tudor Pickering.
Jeff Tillery – Tudor Pickering: Hi, good morning.
David Lesar: Hi, Jeff.
Jeff Tillery – Tudor Pickering: Dave, on Mexico, you laid out relatively cautious outlook for the near term. How do you see that market playing out over the next 12 months. It seems like you’ve obviously had relatively bullish quotes in the press. I’m just curious how you see that market playing out?
David Lesar: Well, I think, if you go back 12 months ago, there were relatively bullish comments made by PEMEX at that time. And I don’t say that in a disrespectful way to PEMEX, its just think it’s in their interest to keep as much of the service company interest engaged in Mexico for as long as possible. However, we have a business to run not only in Mexico but in the rest of North America. And there is a lot of demand for the equipment that we have tied up in Mexico or had tied up in Mexico. So it’s still a market that we like for the long term. We have won a significant amount of discrete services bidding that’s gone on down there in the past several months. But as far as these integrated projects go, I think the on again, off again nature of them really doesn’t lead to an environment where you can make consistent profits. So that is certainly something that we are going to reevaluate if those opportunities come back up. Ad we’ll have to decide whether we want to participate in them or whether there are better opportunities either for discrete services in Mexico or to pull that equipment or additional a pond of equipment out of there and redeploy it to other parts of the world.
Jeff Tillery – Tudor Pickering: That’s helpful. And then my unrelated follow-up question, just the commentary on the call and in the press release around the sustainability of North America and increasing service intensity into next year struck me as more positive than you guys have laid out in the past. Is that -- are contracts at all playing a function to that or is it just the behavior you’re seeing from the customers in terms of increased activities in liquid rich and oil plays?
David Lesar: No, I think it’s really a combination of the demand we see in the liquids-rich and the oil plays and again we’re very well positioned in those markets from an infrastructure and a technology standpoint. The other thing is we are positioned with the right customers that are the big players in these areas. So I think that as maybe the dry gas basins come under pressure, we will be less susceptible to margin pressure, margin declines in those areas. And we will be better positioned in the more liquids-rich end of it and that’s what gives us the confidence that this thing is sustainable to 2011. And then you just look at the demand that’s out there, we can’t get to all of the work for the customers and those key customers that we have today. So as they go to these new plays, we are getting stretched in term of our ability to serve them. So there’s actually in my view sort of a built-in market and market share that we could get with our existing customers, if we had more equipment. And then I think lastly our ability to integrate and optimize the drilling and completion cycle, all is what gives me confidence that this thing is sustainable, certainly through 2011.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley: Thank you very much. Just following up a little bit on Iraq, you own a lot on Iraq over the past six months you highlighted there are some strategic reason, I think, for why you wanted to bid there early. At what point once we look through the inevitable stock up costs of getting established and getting a baseline run rate, can you give us some idea of what dollar and rate revenue you’re targeting off the existing contract awards that you’ve been – that you’ve won?
David Lesar: Well, I mean, I’m not going to, Ole, I’d love to give you what our expected margins and returns are. Suffice it to say that over the terms of these contracts, we expect to make money on them and we expect to be profitable and making meaningful sorts of returns by mid 2011.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley: So by mid 2011, would that then imply that you would have a margin of Iraq that would be equal to, let’s say, the margin that you have in that geographic region, Middle East, Asia?
David Lesar: No, I think the Middle East region is reasonably profitable place for us now. But I think by mid 2011 we’ll be earning our cost to capital and we’ll have the upside from there.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simons.
Bill Herbert – Simons: Thanks. Good morning. Back to the road map for international here for a second, if I understood what you said here, volumes grind higher, margins are basically volume metrically driven going into next year and then at some point, we get better absorption and some net pricing. And with regard to the better absorption and some net pricing, we identified some offshore markets in Iraq but except that, I’m unclear as to where your expectations are for the most significant improvement next year. I think – I mean, the best commentary you provided ex Iraq was Algeria has stabilized. Are there any significant markets in the Eastern Hemisphere other than Iraq that you expect to witness well above average rates of improvement?
Tim Probert: Well, this is Tim, Bill. So let me, let’s just sort of go back to the trough last year, Q3 last year and sort of take a look at where we have seen or where we have the greatest momentum. And we call these double digit countries so the double digit growth rates and better, so as you would expect, Brazil, Argentina, the Andean countries in Latin America have all been very positive in that double-digit group. Libya, Nigeria, Russia, Oman, those also have very good momentum as well. And as you heard in Mark’s commentary, most recently we’ve sort of also seen some very good improvement in the U.K., in Venezuela, China and of course, Iraq and Southeast Asia, so I think what we’re starting to see is, I described those that have the historical momentum from the trough last year in Q3, so that’s a clear year-on-year comparison. And these additional countries that I just mentioned are starting to gather some momentum as we’ve seen on the sequential basis. So I hope that gives you a little bit of guidance in terms of where we’re seeing some of the improvement in activity.
Bill Herbert – Simons: Okay. And then the follow-up here, Dave, with regard to the road map for deepwater ex Gulf of Mexico, one of the things that you mentioned at our gathering a few months ago in Scotland was that a fall out from Wauconda was increased introspection and reticence on the part of the IOCs with regard to reviewing deepwater drilling processes and yet we’re beginning now to see some signs of life sort of percolating in Algeria – and not Algeria -- Angola and other ports of call. Can you refresh us on your views with regard to international deepwater and how you expect that to unfold over the next call it 12 months?
Tim Probert: This is Tim. I’ll take that one.
David Lesar: Sure.
Tim Probert: We can -- I think let’s just talk about the geology first of all and then we can talk about activity. I mean, I think what we are seeing clearly is a historically we’ve seen about 75% of the spend in the so-called Golden Triangle, Brazil, Gulf of Mexico and West Africa, and that’s still going to be very important for us. But clearly, what we’re also starting to see is a significant increase in new provinces, obviously Eastern Mediterranean, Malaysia, North West Shelf of Australia, just to name a few and they are becoming important new exploration provinces for our customers. So we definitely see that expanding. Secondly, with respect to the degree of introspection, I think there certainly has been a certain amount of introspection on behalf of our clients. They operate with global standards across the globe. And I think they are all working very hard to make sure those global standards are consistent with good practices. And there’s no doubt in our mind that we’ll continue to see good growth in deepwater activity around the globe.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz with Weeden & Company.
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Company: Thanks. I’d like to come back to your comments, Dave, about the new business model. I guess, I’m -- maybe I’m not getting the message clearly. But you talked about the capacity constraints, you’re having difficulty serving all of your customer’s demands but it sounded as if the purpose of this new business model was to some extent investing with your clients to help them bring down the breakeven cost of developing. It sounded like dry gas particularly, so are you engaged in a kind of an investment in the future here that maybe is not quite optimizing current results?
David Lesar: No, Geoff. That’s exactly right. Maybe I didn’t articulate it very well. But yeah, this is – this is clearly focused on the dry gas basins, not the liquids-rich or oil basins. You know, a large number of our customers have got a basically a foot in both camp, the dry gas camp and the liquids-rich camp but there are some customers that by the nature of their assets are much more focused on those dry gas plays. And we, in particular, in the industry have always tried to develop new business models to reflect sort of the realities of where natural gas pricing is in the U.S. And we do believe that natural gas is going to play a large part in the U.S. energy future and therefore our business future. And that it’s up to us to find a working together business model for the dry gas plays that will allow our customers to keep their rigs up and therefore working with us in an environment, sustained low natural gas price environment. And it’s also modeled that allows them to make money and it allows us to make money and the kind of returns we want. So it’s a bit of an experiment. Yeah, it did sort of suboptimize the profitability that we could have had. It would have been easy to move that equipment into an oil shale or a liquids-rich shale, but these are good customers of ours. They are key customers of ours and we believe that it’s worth an investment in finding a business model that works for both sides and that’s what we’re doing. So the commitment is to moderate price increases to them and not to move equipment away from them while we work on this new model.
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Company: If I could, the follow-up question is on the international front. You’ve talked a lot about where you see the growth or building momentum. Are there any significant markets where you don’t think activity has yet hit bottom or profitability has yet hit bottom where we might see some further erosion?
David Lesar: In the International Markets, nothing really pops into my mind, Geoff. I’ll think about it while some of the other questions come in here. And if somebody points to me with an answer, I’ll give it to you but nothing off the top of my head.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dan Boyd of Goldman Sachs.
Dan Boyd – Goldman Sachs: Hi, thanks. Dave, I just wanted to follow-up on your earlier comment about spare capacity in the international market. Where do you think we are in terms of how much spare capacity there is from a service perspective and in the five markets where you actually are seeing activity increasing, are you able to start getting pricing or is that still some time off as well?
Tim Probert:  There clearly is some excess capacity in the international markets. So bear in mind that the international markets are not like the North American market. The North America market is pretty homogeneous. You can easily move equipment from one place to another. The international markets tend to be much more compartmentalized. So you can get local pricing and volume effects much more easily in the international markets. We definitely feel that the international markets are still very competitive and as we sort of outlined a little bit earlier, we expect margin improvements to come through volume rather than through pricing until we get into 2011.
Dan Boyd – Goldman Sachs: Okay. So then you are getting pricing in some of those regional markets and the follow-up would be in a volumetric driven recovery how should we think about incremental margins? Is that low 20% range?
Tim Probert: It’s going to be obviously very market specific. And I don’t think we really want to provide some guidance specifically on what those incrementals might look like.
David Lesar:  Let me just add one point to what Tim said and go back to one of my earlier remarks is that we actually had product service lines whose margins did increase in Q3 in the Eastern Hemisphere but those margins were overwhelmed by the decline in margins for PE, as I said because of low vessel utilization and primarily PE was impacted by the project delays. So it wasn’t a homogenous market with respect to that. We do have product lines where the margins are moving up in the Eastern Hemisphere even in Q3.
Dan Boyd – Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thanks.
Christian Garcia: We’ll take one more caller, Sean.
Operator: Sure. Our final question comes from Robin Shoemaker with Citi.
Robin Shoemaker – Citi: Thank you. So Dave to follow-up on what you’ve discussed previously, are we going to see a two-tier pricing structure for pressure pumping in North America between the dry gas basins and liquids-rich. Because I assume if you are going to be accommodating on pricing that other competitors of yours would have to do the same?
David Lesar: Well, I don’t know how the other competitors are going to respond specifically but I would suspect that would be a likely outcome.
Robin Shoemaker – Citi: Okay. And my follow-up is that in some of the basins where there’s the most acute shortage of pressure pumping capacity, some of the E&P companies have decided to build and own pressure pumping spreads of their own. Is that a trend that concerns you?
David Lesar: No. I think we certainly have looked at those announcements. We actually have talked to some of those customers about the rationale for doing it. I think that if you look at where we are positioned, we’re really not concerned about that. I think the companies that are to be concerned about that are those smaller pumping companies that don’t have additional product lines that will have to compete directly with that customer-owned equipment. But in our case, we see sufficient demand out there in the market that although it’s something we’re watching, it’s not something that bothers us at this point in time.
Robin Shoemaker – Citi: Thank you.
Christian Garcia: All right. That will do it. Thank you for you participating in today’s call. Let’s close it out, Sean.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect. Good day

Operator:  Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Halliburton’s Second Quarter earnings call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Christian Garcia, Vice President Investor Relations. Please begin.
Christian Garcia:  Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton Q2 2010 conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and the replay will be available on Halliburton’s website for 7 days. The press release announcing the Q2 results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President Global Business Lines and Corporate Development. In today’s call, Dave will provide opening remarks, Mark will discuss our overall financial performance and liquidity position, and Tim will provide comments on our operations and business outlook. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. I would like to remind our audience that some of today’s comments may include forward looking statements reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results, and cause our actual results to differ from our forward looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2009; Form 10Q for the Quarter ended March 31, 2010; and recent current reports on Form 8K. Note that we will be using the term “international” to refer to our operations outside the US and Canada, and we will refer to the combination of US and Canada as “North America.” Dave?
David Lesar:  Thank you, Christian, and good day to everyone. Overall I’m very pleased with our Q2 results. Our total revenue of $4.4 billion was 26% higher than the prior year, and our first year-on-year increase we’ve experienced since the Q4 of 2008. We were able to leverage our expanded market position to benefit from the significant increase in US land activity and the seasonal recovery in the international markets. Our operating income grew 60% from the prior year, led by more than a 400% increase in North American profitability. Let me talk first a little bit more about North America. North America was our stellar performer in the Q2, with sequential revenue increasing 24% versus US land rig count growth of 13%. This is the first quarter that our sequential revenue increase outpaced rig count growth since the recovery began last year. Operating income improved over 90% sequentially, despite the negative earnings impact of the Canadian seasonal slowdown and the deepwater drilling suspension in the Gulf of Mexico. The gas-directed rig count rose 8% during the Q2. Gas operators are benefiting from productivity gains driven by improved drilling and completion times that lower their breakeven thresholds and enhance their returns. Also, drill to hold activity continues to also influence gas-directed activity. The US oil-directed rig count grew 19% over Q1 levels, buoyed by stabilized commodity prices for liquids. Oil rigs now number close to 600 in the US, a level which we have not seen since the early ‘90s. The continued rebound in oil- and gas-directed activity in the Q2 led to increased utilization levels for our equipment and provided us opportunities to increase prices for several of our product lines, led of course by our stimulation business. We have also experienced smaller increases for directional drilling, cementing, and drill bits, as our ability to integrate services together creates a proposition that adds value to our customers. In this upturn, however, price increases have not been uniform across all the various land basins in the US, because we’re taking a different approach in today’s market environment. We are working with customers to understand their production economics, developing equipment efficiency models and setting prices at rates that allow them to earn the returns that they require while enabling us to also generate an appropriate return for our capital investment in that particular basin. I see this as a win-win situation, as it allows our customers to keep their rigs running but does not force us to leave a particular basin to seek higher returns for our equipment. Across this spectrum, pricing power is highest in the oil and liquid rich basins, and lowest in the conventional dry gas basins, with dry gas shale plays somewhere in between. Utilization levels for our equipment have now surpassed those at the rig count peak in the Q3 of 2008, and are fast approaching levels not seen since the fall of 2006. Utilization levels are highest in the plays with the strongest growth, such as the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, where we have significantly expanded to 24 hour operations.  Discussions are underway with some operators regarding longer-term contracts, and we are experimenting with a few of these. These contracts may contain take-or-pay, or standby rate provisions, which can provide a certain level of revenue stability for US land operations. We are currently evaluating these types of contracts, but I am not yet convinced that they generate the highest returns for our equipment over a full business cycle, and we are not pursuing these arrangements aggressively at this point in time. In the Q2 interest in liquid-rich gas plays remained high because of the relative stability of oil prices and improved operator returns on these resources. These plays now account for 10% to 15% of total rig count, and while they are typically counted as gas rigs they are dependent economically on commodity prices for liquids. Their continued development, however, generates incremental gas production in an already oversupplied gas market and may exert additional downward price pressure for natural gas in the coming months. One of our key strategies in the downturn was to build market share based on our strong belief in the long-term potential of the North American market, and I believe we were very successful in that effort. Our strategy now is to defend this expanded market position. We have been, and we will continue to do this by deploying sufficient incremental capacity to meet the robust demand for our services. We believe the actions we are taking will strengthen the long-term health of our franchise. So even though we see potential for additional upward pricing improvements, these increases will moderate and we expect our sequential revenue growth will more match the rig count in the coming quarters. Any improvement in our margins may also be limited due to increased oil field costs, as we are now seeing significant inflation creep into our US cost structure in such areas as higher commodity, freight, and labor costs.  Let me spend a few moments discussing the situation in the Gulf of Mexico. The tragic incident that occurred on April 20th and the subsequent suspension of deepwater drilling we believe will usher in a new regulatory climate and have a profound impact on how future deepwater drilling is performed. Uncertainty around new drilling requirements and the extent of activity time during and after the drilling suspension will influence the future actions we will take in the Gulf. In addition to the impact of the contraction in the deepwater Gulf, we are also seeing considerable delays in shelf drilling as a result of the new requirements for shallow water permits. I believe these delays combined with the drilling curtailment in deepwater will cause E&P spending to shift onshore and outside the US, to enable operators to meet their production targets.  Gulf activity may also remain restrained after the drilling suspension as operators need to adjust to more stringent drilling and permitting requirements. Further, I do not believe that the deepwater offshore rigs that were mobilized to international locations during this suspension will return to the Gulf for some time, if at all.  Based on this scenario, we’re taking the following actions in our Gulf of Mexico business: First, we are rationalizing our equipment capacity in the Gulf. We are transferring drilling and down-hole wire line tools to international locations to support new projects that we have already won. Cementing, mud logging and wire line skid units are all rig-based, and typically their transfer will go with the rig as it leaves the Gulf of Mexico. We have two stimulation vessels that have been working in the Gulf of Mexico and will continue to work in the shallow water, and we intend to keep them in the Gulf during this period. At this point, overall equipment movements are just starting and it is too early to tell if this will meaningfully impact the pricing dynamics in the international markets.  We also currently have an aggressive hiring program in our US land operations, and we are transferring a significant number of our Gulf field personnel to satisfy this need. In addition, we are relocating some of our engineering personnel to the international offshore market to retain our extensive deepwater talent. In the near term we intend to keep our infrastructure intact in the Gulf of Mexico. This obviously will impact our short-term results but will allow us to remain competitive once activity resumes in the marketplace. Despite these short-term impacts, the events in the Gulf of Mexico have not at all stifled our enthusiasm for increased global deepwater activity in the upcoming years. Contributions from the service sector can play a valuable role in developing new technology, innovations, and best practices to help our customers operate safely and efficiently in these challenging conditions, and I believe will generate a corresponding increase in service intensity. Tim will talk about this a little bit more later. Let me turn now to our international business, starting with Latin America. Latin America posted strong improvement from the Q1’s weak results. Brazil continues to stand out in terms of revenue growth. In the Q2 our Brazil operations generated sequential double digit revenue increases and year-on-year growth of close to 30%, driven by our well construction product lines. In the past year we have made significant strides in solidifying our market position in Brazil, with wins in directional drilling, wire lines, fluids, testing, and completions. Additionally, we have and continue to make infrastructure investments in Brazil. We believe that these investments, combined with our unique deepwater capabilities, will ensure that we continue to be well positioned to benefit from Brazil’s long-term growth prospects.  Mexico also had improved results in the quarter; however, we believe that the current quarter activity levels for Mexico are unlikely to be sustainable. Our customer has informed its service providers that due to budgetary constraints they will be reducing the number of rigs allocated to Chicontepec for the remainder of the year to about two rigs per major service company. We are currently operating on four rigs and were about to add a fifth. Additionally we anticipate activity in the Burgos basin to remain depressed given the continued weakness in natural gas prices. To counteract this we have started adjusting our Mexico’s cost structure and are transferring equipment to other locations in Latin America and the US. As a result we may incur some restructuring charges in Q3 to account for these actions. For the remainder of the year we see strong growth from Brazil, Columbia and hopefully Argentina, which may offset weaknesses in Mexico and Venezuela. Given the unevenness of the growth prospects in these countries, we are not anticipating a material net improvement in overall revenues and margins for our Latin America region in the second half of the year. Now for the Eastern Hemisphere. Eastern Hemisphere revenue and operating income increased 9% and 23% sequentially, while incremental margins were 36%. Our Q2 results reflect a seasonal rebound from bad Q1 weather experienced in Russia, China, Australia, and Indonesia. Despite the strong rebound in our Eastern Hemisphere results, we are cautious about a number of factors that may impact the rate of the industry’s growth the rest of the year. Continued concerns around the current pace of economic recovery and corresponding energy demands are causing some of our customers to reevaluate their execution plans for the second half of the year. Furthermore, based on the Gulf spill, international customers are revisiting their deepwater processes and that also is causing short-term delays in the startup of certain projects. Theses factors, together with continued, very competitive levels of international pricing, may lead to a lower ramp up of revenues and margins in Q3, with stronger growth resuming toward the end of the year. So, our Q2 results show the successful execution of our strategy, of balancing our geographic, technology, and services portfolio. In the second half of 2010 and beyond we will continue to increase our exposure to the industry’s highest growth markets, like deepwater and unconventional resources to optimize our growth and returns.  Now let me turn it over to Mark, and he’ll get into a little more detail on the financial results.
Mark McCollum:  Thanks, Dave, and good morning everyone. As I go over our financial highlights I’ll be comparing our Q2 results sequentially to the Q1 of 2010. Our revenue in the Q2 was $4.4 billion, up 17% from the previous quarter. Total operating income for the Q2 was $762 million, up 70% from the previous quarter. All of our regions registered double digit increases. International margins in the Q2 improved to 16%, as all of our international regions registered steady improvements from Q1 levels. For North America margins in the Q2 increased from the prior quarter due to strong activity and improved pricing across most basins, with overall incrementals exceeding 50%. North America margins were generally consistent month to month throughout this quarter. Now I’ll highlight the segment results. Completion and production revenue increased $429 million or 22%, and operating income more than doubled with solid contribution from all regions. Looking at completion and production on a geographic basis, North America revenue increased by 27%, while operating income grew by 126% from better activity and pricing. Increased completions intensity, particularly in unconventional shale basins, has led to high utilization rates that are exceeding levels experienced during the 2007-2008 time period.  In Latin America, completion and production revenue increased by 5% and operating income increased 17%, primarily from improved performance in Mexico, Columbia, and Argentina. In Europe Africa CIS completion and production revenue and operating income increased 19% and 144% respectively, due to strong production enhancement activity in The Congo, Algeria, and the North Sea, and increased completion tool sales in Norway and Nigeria. In Middle East Asia completion and production posted sequential increases in revenue and operating income of 14% and 76% respectively, due to strong completions in production enhancement activity in Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Southeast Asia. In our Drilling and Evaluation Division revenue and operating income increased by $197 million and $48 million respectively, primarily as a result of higher activity across all our regions except Europe Africa CIS. In North American Drilling and Evaluations revenue and operating income increased 17% and 41% respectively, as most of our product service lines continue to benefit from increased horizontal drilling, which grew approximately 18% from the Q1. Current horizontal rigs represent over 50% of total US rigs, and are now about 33% higher than the levels we saw in the peak rig count of the Q3 of 2008. Drilling and Evaluations Latin America revenue and operating income increased 21% and over 224% respectively, from higher testing activity in Brazil and increased software sales and project activity in Mexico. In the Europe Africa CIS region drilling and evaluation revenue and operating income were down $13 million and $38 million respectively, due to lower activity in the North Sea and certain locations in West Africa, which were partially offset by the seasonal recovery in Russia. And Drilling and Evaluations Middle East Asia revenue and operating income were up 13% and 14% respectively, from higher drilling activity in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, increased fluids revenues in Australia, and from wire line service in Iraq. In the Q2 we completed seven wells relating to our Ghawar project in Saudi Arabia as scheduled. This quarter’s effective income tax rate was 30%. It’s lower than our previous guidance due to the favorable impact of an R&D credit settlement that we received late in the quarter. We continue to forecast that our effective income tax rate for the balance of the year will be somewhere between 32% and 33%.  Dave discussed our current plans to address the deepwater drilling suspension in the Gulf of Mexico, but I’d like to provide some additional color if I may. Our Gulf of Mexico region business represented approximately 6% of our total revenues for the first half of 2010. We have said before that roughly 65% of our Gulf of Mexico region business relates to deepwater. We have also said that labor costs represent about a third of our total cost structure. Based on our current assumptions on activity levels during and after the deepwater drilling suspension, we have started redeploying to other markets close to 20% of the 2,200 employees serving in the Gulf of Mexico region, as well as some of our other assets. Despite our mitigation efforts we're currently estimating that the drilling suspension will impact our earnings by somewhere between $0.05 and $0.08 per quarter starting in the Q3, and continuing for a few more quarters. As all of you would appreciate, the situation in the Gulf continues to evolve and there will continue to be some level of uncertainty around the full impact of the drilling suspension on our future financial results. With respect to the Deepwater Horizon incident, we continue to be confident that Halliburton performed all work with respect to the Macondo well in accordance with BP’s specifications for its well construction plan and BP’s instructions. Our contract with BP Exploration provides specific indemnification of Halliburton for claims and expenses relating to situations just like the Macondo incident. However, this obviously could be subject to challenge by various parties.  In addition, while some have questioned BP’s financial survivability, we do not believe this is a likely outcome. But clearly our indemnification is dependent on BP’s financial ability to perform under its contractual indemnity obligations. As you know there are also a number of announced Congressional and other governmental investigations that are currently ongoing. We are and will continue to cooperate fully with all these efforts. However, because of these investigations as well as various lawsuits pending on this matter, we will not be taking further questions regarding the Deepwater Horizon incident during this call. Tim?
Tim Probert:  Thanks, Mark, and good morning everyone. As Dave discussed we remain very positive about the long-term prospects of deepwater activity despite the recent events in the Gulf of Mexico. I’ll provide a few additional observations on the development of these resources.  The US has had around 15% of the world's 242 floating rigs, the third largest market after Asia/Pacific and Latin America. IHS data indicates that over the last five years deepwater and ultra deepwater accounted for some 40% of global new discoveries, with the size of deepwater discoveries being about three times those of shallow water. Core deepwater areas like Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico, and central West African basins are being supplemented by expansions in Australasia, North and East Africa and the North Sea, stretching geographical boundaries of deepwater activity and providing increased opportunities for oil field service companies. The application of new technology to aide our customers in the planning and execution of their deepwater development is critical for them in balancing their risk-reward matrix, and is an area of significant focus for Halliburton. For example, the Landmark suite of advanced 3D seismic interpretation and analysis tools are providing real value in West Africa and Brazil in helping customers gain an understanding of complex reservoirs, including subsalt. In the area of reservoir characterization, Halliburton’s GeoTap® IDS technology is allowing operators for the first time to capture and analyze reservoir fluids during the drilling process; while after drilling, during well testing, newly introduced DynaLinkTM technology offers analysis of reservoir flow potential, also in real time, reducing uncertainty and improving efficiency. Deepwater production represents roughly 6% to 7% of total world oil production today, and is expected to double in the next five years. Old field service companies that have the unique combination of technology, expertise, and infrastructure will participate meaningfully in the development of these reservoirs. We believe that Halliburton’s past and current investments are placing the company in an excellent position to benefit from the growth of deepwater activity worldwide. Dave?
David Lesar:  Thanks, Tim. Let me now just quickly summarize where we’re at. Increase in overall activity and completion intensity in the Q2 have led to very high utilization rates and increased pricing for most of our product service lines in the US. Going forward we expect that the overall rig count will continue to grow but at a slower rate, and also we expect further pricing opportunities. Our already high utilization rate and growing cost threshold will serve to somewhat slow down the rate of improvement in our margins. Our international business showed progression in both revenue and margins during the Q2. We continue to believe that the second half of 2010 will be better for our international markets. However, we now expect that the growth will be more weighted toward the end of the year than we had originally anticipated. So we remain very bullish about the prospects of global deepwater activity and we will utilize our technology, capabilities, and global infrastructure to benefit also from this secular trend.  Let’s go ahead and open it up for questions at this point. 
Operator:  Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, (Operator instructions) One moment for the first question. Our first question comes from Dan Boyd of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Dan Boyd – Goldman Sachs: Alright, thanks. Good morning, guys. Can we understand that the progression of margin was throughout the quarter in North America, presumably the exit rate was much higher than what you reported?
Mark McCollum:  Hi Dan, this is Mark. As I mentioned in my comments, the margins were actually fairly consistent in North America month to month. You know, we had seen in the first quarter a steady progression upward at quite a rapid pace; in the Q2 they leveled off quite a bit. And so the June margin itself wasn’t that far off of the quarter average.
David Lesar:  Let me just add a little bit to that because it’s not that our ability to increase pricing slowed down. And I mentioned a couple times, we’re starting to have to deal a little bit with the affect of increasing costs. So we are attempting obviously to continue to raise pricing and raise margins, but our vendors are wanting a piece of that ability at this point in time.
Dan Boyd – Goldman Sachs:  Okay. And then as a follow-up: Latin America is the one area that also surprised us with margins coming in a little bit better than expected. Understanding that Mexico is going to pull back a little bit, but can you help us understand what sequentially drove the increase in Mexico? And have you started the cost, cutting costs there already?
Tim Probert : Well, the big story in Latin America is Brazil, and Brazil is really what was the primary driver for the strength of Latin America during the quarter. With respect to Mexico, I think the best way to think about Mexico is that the current quarter sort of provided a peak of Mexico performance. And as Dave alluded to, we do not expect that to continue. Clearly the budgetary constraints are going to have a significant impact on that.
Dan Boyd – Goldman Sachs:  As you go to I guess right size your cost basis in Mexico and you potentially look to take a charge, excluding that charge, should we expect Latin American margins more or less flat from here?
Mark McCollum:  I think that’s a good assumption.
Dan Boyd – Goldman Sachs:  Okay. Thanks, I’ll turn it over.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.
Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company:  Thanks, good morning. Dave, you mentioned that your international and especially your Eastern Hemisphere customer base was a little bit more reticent with regard to the pace of spending increases given the economic outlook. Is that reticence coming predominantly from IOCs or is it NOCs as well?
David Lesar:  No, it’s primarily the IOCs and it’s really hard to tell what – there’s two things at play here. One is them sort of taking a look at the economic conditions and getting these big projects started, because on these major projects, once you start and sanction them there’s really no turning them off until you’ve spent a lot of money. So I suspect that a lot of our customers are using a pause from the Gulf of Mexico to sort of do a last study of their processes. It’s really a way for them to step back, take a couple of more deep breaths before they embark on some of these major, long-term projects. So we’re not concerned that these projects are not going to go forward. They will go forward, but I think that everyone’s like I said, just taking a last breath or two and maybe delaying by a quarter or a half a quarter the sanctioning of these projects.
Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company:  Right, and I get the fact that clients are more introspective with regard to deepwater well designs and processes, and that’s mostly IOCs. But the reticence with regard to the overall economic outlook, that’s IOCs as well.
David Lesar: That’s correct, and I would say actually it’s primarily IOCs.
Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company:  Okay, good. And then secondly, again focusing on the second half of this year, which Eastern Hemisphere markets do you think relative to the first half are going to show the most positive rate of change?
David Lesar:  Well, the most obvious one will be the North Sea. The North Sea has really struggled through the first two quarters, and I think any help in that market can’t help but look better against sort of the first half performance. And Algeria has been another one that has been troublesome in the first part of the year. That’s a big business for us and for other service companies. And with the changeover in management and some of the delays in sanctioning projects, that’s been a country that has relatively underperformed our expectations in sort of half one, which we hope would get better in the second part of the year.
Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company:  Okay, and I will sneak one last one in here. Any comments with regard to Russia, how it’s performing, and outlook for the second half of this year relative to your expectations coming into the year?
Tim Probert:  I think we would say in general that Russia’s a little bit below our original expectations for the second half of the year. That obviously remains to be seen, Bill, but our sort of general sense at the present time is that it may not perform quite as strongly as we had originally intended, and that was sort of in the double digit growth range that we’d announced I think at the end of the year.
Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company:  Okay, thanks very much.
Operator:  Our next question comes from David Anderson of J P Morgan. Your question please.
David Anderson – J P Morgan:  Thanks. Hey Dave, I just wanted to get back to you, you talked about some long-term contracts on the US land market. It’s pretty clear you’re trying to avoid the ’05-’06 repeat when too much capacity entered the market. But now obviously access to capital isn’t what it used to be, but I would just think that long-term contracts would seem to be the best way to offset any kind of capacity concerns. So I guess a two-part question: one, how concerned are you about capacity as of the next twelve months in the US land market; and second, what do you need to see in the long-term contracts to make it more attractive to you? Is it a function of locking up a prescribed utilization rate, is it index pricing? I’m just kind of curious about what it would take for you to take to enter into more of those.
David Lesar:  Yeah, good question. I made the comment that I’m not yet convinced they’re the way to go for a couple of reasons. Especially they’re not the way to go for us where we are in the cycle right now because you’re essentially locking in essentially a fixed price for a set amount of utilization. And as I indicated, I believe that we have upside to prices in North America and I would not want to tie equipment down with a long-term contract and miss some of the pricing upside, while at the same time not being able to fix the cost side of the equation. The second is that although people get enamored or sometimes our people get enamored with sort of the recurring fixed price nature of these, our customers have shown no compunction to just tear the contract up when it’s to their advantage when pricing is going down. So I don’t see that we’re getting any downside price protection, and I believe we are limiting our upside return potential by entering into some sort of a long-term contract that’s got a fixed price component to it right now. The ones we are experimenting with have an element of a fixed price and a commitment as to percentage utilization, but again, those are very difficult to measure in practice and therefore we’re just going to stay away from them right now for the most part as I said, because I’m not convinced they yield us the highest overall return over a cycle.
David Anderson – J P Morgan:  That contract that you indicated last quarter, that $750 million contract to Wilson, does that qualify for that evaluation?
David Lesar:  No, no it doesn’t. That was a different kind of contract.
David Anderson – J P Morgan:  Okay. On a different subject you were talking about reallocation costs occurring in the Gulf of Mexico. I guess two questions – how quickly can you get this done? Is that kind of by the end of the year? And also internally how many active rigs are you guys counting on the deepwater twelve months from today? I think the last I spoke to you guys, you were thinking about 17 rigs. That was a month and a half ago, and I can’t imagine things have gotten any better in your opinion.
Tim Probert:  Well, with respect to our planning what we told you last time is we were planning on about 50% of the level of activity, roughly 17 rigs, approximately six to 12 months after the suspension was lifted. There’s probably no reason to change that right now in terms of an assessment of what might take place. And you have to have a basis for planning your business – that’s the one that we’ve used, and we’ll obviously modify that based on the flow of information that we’ve received. But with respect to the movement of capital items, that happens relatively quickly and yes, that reallocation will be complete by the end of the year.
David Anderson – J P Morgan:  And if you took your offshore margins, you’re moving, obviously everybody else is moving as well. I think you highlighted that you’re not too sure margins are going to go. How concerned should we be about excess capacity? I didn't think there was a big capacity issue with a lot of the equipment internationally. Is that true? 
Tim Probert:  You know, there is a limited amount of assets that are likely to be moved into the international markets for a variety of reasons – some of it is the type of equipment, some of it is size, some of it is suitability. So you know there’s always that potential that everyone doing everything at the same time may have an impact, but there's certainly no evidence that that’s taken place at the present.
Mark McCollum:  Things like vessels for an example might be more impactful, if vessels move on a wholesale basis to other markets.
David Anderson – J P Morgan:  Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. 
Scott Gruber – Sanford Bernstein:  Yes, good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to turn back to the guidance of the earnings impact and the drilling suspension in the Gulf. Do you assume any deepwater activity in those figures?
David Lesar:  No. If you think about the 5% to 8% we announced, if a reasonable level of shelf drilling goes forward in the next couple of quarters, and I think that’s a little iffy at this point in time, then I think the hit to earrings will be at the low end. If the shelf continues to find it very difficult to get permits and therefore they can’t drill, then I think it’s going to be toward the upper end. One of the things we are not doing is we are not going to diminish our infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico. So yes, we’re going to try to move people; yes, we’re going to try to move equipment. But we are going to maintain our vast Gulf of Mexico facilities - lab, manufacturing, all of those facilities – on the basis that the Gulf is going to come back, which we believe it will. And that will be part of a drag on earnings for a period of time. But in our view, when the Gulf comes up again you’re going to have to have that stuff in place. I’d just rather keep it and pay for it on an as-we-go basis than try to recalibrate it and reconstitute it at some point in time in the future.
Scott Gruber – Sanford Bernstein:  Just to be clear, the upper end of the range includes an anemic outlook on shallow water activity and virtually no deepwater activity?
David Lesar:  Yeah, the 8% is anemic shallow water and the bottom of the range is a more robust shallow water environment.
Scott Gruber – Sanford Brown:  Got it.
Mark McCollum:  It’s $0.05 to $0.08, of course.
David Lesar:  Yeah, the lower of $0.05 and the higher of $0.08, yes.
Tim Probert:  I think it is interesting to note that we were mobilized last week on a shelf well construction project, so it’s not, it’s by no means a trend but it does sort of indicate that we’re starting to see some movement on the permitting front.
Scott Gruber – Sanford Bernstein:  Okay. And an unrelated follow-up: Can you provide some color on where you think the industry stands in the drill to hold acreage by production trend?
Tim Probert:  Of course, there is no sort of perfect repository of this information, but the general information that we have from our own organizations suggest that we saw a decline in Q1 in the overall position. And drill to hold, the inventory of wells that is out there increased somewhat in Q2, and we expect to see a sharp increase in Q3 based on the information that we have, particularly Bakken and Eagle Ford. So we’ll see that inventory continue to rise. With respect to drill and hold specifically, most of our customers really indicate to us they still have a firm amount of activity to take them through into 2011.
David Lesar: Yeah, and I think one other area that is sort of pushing drilling that a lot of people have not focused on is companies that are drilling with other people’s money. And keep in mind that over the last year a number of the big US gas players have announced transactions with primarily outside of the US IOCs and in some cases other money players to essentially have them carry their drilling programs for them. And I think that is actually going to also drive some additional drilling because you know, the customers have the liquidity provided by others to be able to do so.
Scott Gruber – Sanford Bernstein:  Okay, great.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital:  Hey, good morning. A quick follow-up here on once again that $0.05 to $0.08 impact in the third and fourth quarter. Is that, do you think the increase in your North American land related business will fully, partially, or more than offset that $0.05 to $0.08 impact from the Gulf of Mexico in the second half of the year? Better activity, better pricing on North American land – is that going to offset that $0.05 to $0.08 number?
Mark McCollum:  Kurt, this is Mark. I think as we look forward in terms of what the US businesses are doing, in the Q3 it seems like US land will probably fully offset or at least get very close to fully offsetting the weakness in the Gulf. Fourth quarter, you know, as we move into winter stiffs in our business it may be a little less, but that’s, we’re still very excited about what’s happening on US land right now.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital:  Thanks. And then a question for Dave: In your discussions with your varying oil company customers, how do those customers handicap what the Gulf of Mexico could look like twelve months out? What kinds of rules and regulations are they preparing for and when do they think that they’re going to be able to start to ramp up their activity?
David Lesar:  Well, I think the discussions are many and the conclusions are varied, I guess would be the best way to put it. I think that nobody believes that they will be out of business in the Gulf of Mexico let’s say a year from now. I think one of the big concerns is going to be the ability to get the deepwater rigs to come back into the Gulf of Mexico market if they’re absorbed in other parts of the world. Remember, these things take a long time to drag out of the Gulf and halfway around the world. That’s a lot of downtime on those rigs. So the concern is the ability to get the rigs, bring them back in here. What are the insurance costs going to be? What are the new regulations going to be? So I would say that in the next twelve months that there's probably very little discussion taking place about the ability to ramp up to anywhere near the level that we were at. But if you look at the prospects, you look at the reservoirs there, a number of the big IOCs are very heavily committed to the Gulf of Mexico and they certainly will start up as fast as is practical after they get the go-ahead.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital:  And last follow-up here: Your reference on pricing, I was wondering if you just- I think it would be fair to assume that pressure pumping has the best pricing dynamics at the moment. I was just wondering what product lines have the least ability to get pricing at this stage?
Tim Probert:  Well clearly our stimulation business leads the pack in terms of pricing. I think the important thing really to understand here from our standpoint is the way we try and use our stimulation business to provide an integrated package of value propositions for our customers. Probably as we look across the board, clearly stimulation is at the high end; directional drilling, drill bits, completions in the middle; and wire line probably is at the bottom end of the range in terms of pricing realization.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital:  But all product lines are gaining some element of pricing at this point. Is that true?
Tim Probert:  Correct.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley:  Thank you. Mark, can you give us an update on CAPEX for the year?
Mark McCollum:  Well, we’re still looking at approximately $2 billion, in that range, the $2 billion range for total CAPEX for the year. So still sort of in line with the previous guidance at this point.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley:  Okay, and when you increased the previous guidance it was because you saw some international projects for 2011 move to 2010. It sounds like some of that is slipping a little bit again, so does that mean that you are tweaking your CAPEX more in favor of North American stimulation at the moment?
Mark McCollum:  Well, I think yeah. Part of the increase the last time around was also an acceleration of some capital deliveries into the US market where we saw demand for things like pressure pumping equipment increasing. So that was serving to offset that, and I think that continues to be the case – any kind of a weakness that we might see in capital deliveries in international will be offset by deliveries for additional capacity in the US land.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley:  Okay, thank you. Second question to you: This has always been to me somewhat a bizarre relationship to psychology around international pricing relative to what’s going on in the North American market, and clearly the North American market is divided between the very hot land market and the not-so-hot deepwater offshore markets. What are you seeing in terms of the psychological impact on overseas markets based on what’s going on in the US at the moment?
Tim Probert:  Clearly international pricing is still very competitive, Ole. We have, as you recall we had a very active 2009 in terms of bidding processes as our customers took advantage of the changing dynamics in the industry, and those contracts clearly have come into play during the course of 2010. And as you would appreciate there is some time between the ability to move those prices and the start up of those contracts. So I would say in general international pricing is still quite challenging. There are a few areas that are a little brighter than others, but in general, that psychology if you like from the North American market is still prevailing in the international markets.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley:  Okay, Tim, that sounds very similar to what you said last quarter, and yet you increased Middle East margins by 300 basis points and the rest of the Eastern Hemisphere by 100 basis points sequentially. So is there a volume effect here? I don’t know what’s going on.
Mark McCollum:  No. I think, Ole, that one of the things, once you get a handle on what your pricing dynamics are in Eastern Hemisphere markets, because of the longer-term nature of those contracts, it’s easier to get your cost structure in line to support those contracts at what is a sufficient margin to take them on. And as Tim said, in 2009 we were really dealing with a rapidly changing pricing environment. We really didn’t have an idea where that was going to settle down, and therefore we did not do a lot of changing to our cost structure last year. Now that we know what these contracts are, what we’ve won, what the pricing is on them, we can make sure that our organization by country, by product line, is now aligned with supporting that contract but also being able to give us a chance to increase our margins going forward.
Ole Sorer – Morgan Stanley:  So you see continued improvements to right size your infrastructure, your cost structure relative to the business that you’ve signed?
Mark McCollum:  Oh yes. Every quarter that’s something that we work on and we try to focus on and sharpen up our operating capabilities by country at a lower cost.
Ole Sorer – Morgan Stanley:  Okay, finally just one more on Iraq. There’s been a whole bunch of announcements over the past 24 hours whether it’s Lukoil or BP, and there’s some very large headline numbers. Is it 2010, 2011, or 2012, or when should we expect that this will be a meaningful contributor for you?
David Lesar:  I don’t think you should expect to see anything in 2010. We're in the back half of the year now. You see a lot of headline numbers; I saw the same ones you did. We’re having the same discussions with a lot of these customers. It’ll take awhile to get these contracts awarded. Typically then they don’t have startups for three to six months after award. So I would say that you’ll see awards in 2010, probably costs and ramp up in 2011 with some commensurate revenues, and then sort of a more reasonable operating environment probably into 2012.
Ole Sorer – Morgan Stanley:  Okay, thank you very much.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.
Angie Sedita – UBS: Great. Well first, congratulations on a very good quarter.
David Lesar:  Thanks.
Mark McCollum:  Thanks, Angie.
Angie Sedita – UBS:  The first question, talking about pressure pumping which we have at length already, but do you have any concerns – you said you were going to protect market share. Any concerns so far in what you’re seeing from your peers as far as new capacity additions? And then coupled with that, one of your peers obviously with the recent merger and then your other peer with a renewed focus on North America, are you seeing any change in their behavior specifically?
Dave Lesar:  Yeah. I think at this point in time everybody appears to be acting pretty responsibly. And we did work hard to increase our market share in the last downturn and we believe we have; that market share is ours to keep, and we’re going to bring the equipment in necessary to support it. We don’t see anything happening right now which would let us conclude that there’s a big wave of equipment coming into the North America market other than what an individual company believes is necessary to support its own market share.
Angie Sedita – UBS:  Okay, good to know. And then another is a follow-up to Bill’s question earlier in the call. He asked about where you expect to see stronger growth internationally. What markets outside of Mexico and Venezuela could see a slower recovery on the back half of the year?
Tim Probert:  Which markets could be slower? You’ve already touched on Mexico. I think that you know, clearly North Africa, particularly Algeria as Dave mentioned earlier is somewhat of a concern, primarily because we see some, shall we say, slowness in decision making there causing some hold up in overall activity. West Africa in general, there has been a little bit of a slowness there in terms of the mobilization of new contracts which we had expected to take place by now, though the full force of those I think will come in during late 2010. Other than that, Angie, I don’t have any specifics, other than of course the North Sea continues to be a challenging chestnut here. Activity has been quite slow in the first half of the year. We have better expectations for the second half, but we’ve said that before.
Angie Sedita – UBS:  Okay. And then finally just as a follow-up to that, do you think there’s any risk to a push out to the international recovery to 2011 given global economic conditions, the Gulf of Mexico, a little bit of nerves [ph] by the IOCs? Or do you think clearly the NOCs should begin to pick up in Q4 and we’ll see at least some of it this year?
Tim Probert:  Yeah, every indication we have at the present time is as Dave said in his comments, that we’ll see a slightly slower rate of change in Q3 than we had originally expected, picking up momentum in Q4.
Angie Sedita – UBS:  All right.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Jim Crandell with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jim Crandell – Barclays:  Good morning. Dave, last cycle in US pressure pumping there was shortages of equipment, competitors built capacity and you and your main competitor lost considerable market share. And I think you said “We will not let that happen again.” You seem to me more restrained on prices and seem to be planning to be more aggressive in adding equipment early on than you were last cycle. Am I assessing things correctly?
David Lesar:  I think, Jim, one of the lessons we learned from the last time is that you can push pricing up so hard so fast across all basins that you make it uneconomic for your customers to continue to drill; and once that cycle sort of turns over it can get pretty ugly as we’ve seen. So as I indicated in my comments, we’re trying to go basin by basin this time, work with our customers on understanding the returns they need and helping them understand the returns we need. And the returns we need sometimes are more about efficiency than they are about pricing. So we’re trying to do more of a rifle shot approach instead of a shotgun blast in the market. And we have a targeted market share that we have right now and we are going to build equipment to meet that targeted market share, but we’re not going to build any equipment beyond being able to do that. And I hope everybody else is sort of equally responsible.
Jim Crandell – Barclays:  And on that last point you made, David, what do you see on that score today?
David Lesar :  I see everybody being pretty responsible right now.
Jim Crandell – Barclays:  Okay. My second question is exclusive of Iraq, how active do you see bidding on IPMs in the second half and over the rest of the year? And specifically where might that bidding activity occur?
David Lesar: The IPM market right now, if you look at the markets that were embracing IPM in a big way obviously were Iraq, a little bit of Saudi Arabia - you know we won the South Ghawar project which by the way is going very, very well - and Algeria. And of course Mexico is the story everybody knows about. Obviously the IPM day seems to be coming to an end in Mexico. Algeria, it’s still a market that there’s a lot of IPM activity in but we have been unsuccessful, as has our competitors in getting extensions signed by Sonatrach on a lot of the existing ones. So that’s out there as a market but right now it’s pretty slow in Algeria. Iraq obviously will be a big IPM market, but you see scatterings of it here and there but it doesn’t seem to be developing a big bow wave out in front of it right now. And I think that as commodity prices have stabilized, especially liquid commodity prices, I think you’re seeing more and more of sort of the standard type of contracts more than a reach for an IPM type of engagement.
Jim Crandell – Barclays:  Okay. And lastly, Dave, on Iraq, what would you, do you think that all 11 or 12 sanctioned projects by the major oil companies will in fact be awarded this year? We’ve seen announcements as was alluded to on West Kerna and Majnoon and Zubair. But do you think that other companies like Petronas and Gazprom, do you think that all 12 will go forward with contract awards? 
David Lesar:  I don’t think that all 12 will get done this year for a couple of reasons. One, the service industry’s capacity to handle - all that is going to be stretched with just some of the major initial big ones. Number two, I think our customers are finding it maybe more difficult than anticipated to get a tender award through the National Oil Company approval process, which all of them are required to do in Iraq. And therefore, you will see the major ones awarded this year but you definitely will not see them all.
Jim Crandell – Barclays:  And would you expect to see, Dave, bidding for the first one (inaudible) wasn’t so hot. Do you think the bidding will be reflective of the fact that capacity is going to be tight as we get into the second half of the year and we hopefully will see better pricing and margins on future contracts there?
David Lesar:  I hope so.
Jim Crandell – Barclays:  Me too. Thank you.
Mark McCollum:  We’ll take one more caller.
Operator:  Our final question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Jefferies.
Stephen Gengaro – Jefferies:  Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Just a quick sort of follow-up on North America if you don’t mind. Over the last six months we’ve certainly been surprised by the pace of your utilization increases. Can you sort of highlight, if you will, the areas where that has been maybe the strongest and the biggest surprise to you? And then second, when you look at the market now, do you feel like the benefits of being big in North America are improving because of that versus a couple of years ago?
David Lesar:  I mean certainly the benefits of being big, we believe in it. And when we say “big,” I mean have the ability to bring multiple product lines to a customer offering, and have one poke through to the other. So I think being integrated and having multiple product lines certainly is working to our advantage. You know, if you look at why the sort of sudden increase in capacity – one, we have been talking for a number of quarters about the higher horse powers that are needed to frac these shale plays, and we now have to show up on a major shale play with 40,000 horsepower just to sort of ante into the game. And if you look at the average horsepower per job all the way across the US, it’s doubled in the last six to twelve months. So not every job takes 40,000 horsepower, but the average job in North America has doubled its horsepower utilization. So that in itself is absorbing a lot of the industry capacity. The more aggressive horizontal drilling, especially in some of the hard to drill hotter shale plays, are eating drilling tools up. The higher horsepower, higher flow rates on the fraccing is eating frac equipment up, it’s eating drill bits up. And so the nature of the drilling, the more difficult type of situations, and the higher horsepower needs all are increasing the demand for what you have to show up with on the job, and it’s also consuming that equipment a lot more quickly. That in itself, as we have said in prior quarters, we thought would help balance out the supply and demand of equipment in the US. And I think that’s turned out to be a dead-on call.
Stephen Gengaro – Jefferies:  And that phenomena is obviously pretty sticky versus normal cyclical dips and peaks.
David Lesar:  No, that’s correct.
Stephan Gengaro – Jefferies:  Thank you.
Christian Garcia:  All right. Before we close we would like to announce that Halliburton’s Q3 2010 Conference Call will be held on Monday, October 18th, 2010 at 9:00 AM Eastern Time. Thank you for participating on today’s call. Shawn?
Operator:  Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the conference. Everyone may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2010 Q1  (2010-04-19 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Christian Garcia – Vice President, Investor Relations  David Lesar – Chief Executive Officer  Mark McCollum – Chief Financial Officer  Timothy Probert – President, Global Business Lines & Corporate Development 
Analysts: Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets William Herbert - Simmons & Company International Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Angie Sedita - UBS James Crandell - Barclays Capital William Sanchez - Howard Weil Inc. Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup Brad Handler - Credit Suisse 
Operator:  Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Halliburton’s first quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Christian Garcia, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please begin.
Christian Garcia:  Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2010 conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available at Halliburton’s website for seven days. The press release announcing the first quarter results is available on the Halliburton website.  Joining me today are David Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Global Business Lines and Corporate Development.  In today’s call Dave will provide opening remarks, Mark will discuss our overall financial performance and Tim will provide comments on our operations and business outlook. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. I would like to remind our audience that some of today’s comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton’s future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and our recent current reports on Form 8-K. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release announcing the first quarter results. Note that we will be using the term international to refer to our operations outside the U.S. and Canada, and we will refer to the combination of U.S. and Canada as North America. Dave?
David Lesar:  Thank you Christian and good morning to everyone. Our first quarter results reflect the sharp contrast between the North America and international markets. Total revenue for the first quarter grew 2% sequentially, with a 19% increase in our North American business offset by a contraction in our international operations. In North America, the rebound in U.S. drilling activity combined with the secular trend toward more service intensive work resulted in a meaningful absorption of the industry’s oil field equipment capacity. This is most evident in stimulation, where utilization approached levels not seen since 2008. This activity rebound provided an opportunity to improve pricing across most of our product service lines as the quarter progressed. Outside of North America, international markets experienced a more challenging than expected environment. Our first quarter results reflected the expected impact of renewal of contracts that [inaudible] in 2009, as well as the usual seasonal declines in software and direct sales. However, we also experienced project delays in worse than normal weather conditions in certain markets. We now believe that tangible indications are appearing that barring any major economic disruption, the industry may experience a steady resurgence in international activity during the second part of 2010 and into 2011.  Our balanced geographic and product portfolios have thus far, and I believe will continue, to serve us well, given the contrasting points in the cycles that we have for North America and the international markets. Our strategy remains the same. We will continue to invest in key markets and focus on retaining our strong market share position.  Let me now discuss our financial results in more detail, starting with North America. North America revenue grew 19% sequentially versus a U.S. rate comp growth of 21%. Operating income improved by about 120% over fourth quarter levels. The shift toward the major shale’s has continued unabated and now constitutes roughly 35% of the total drilling activity in the U.S. In addition, horizontal directed activity is now 20% higher than the peak levels in the third quarter of 2008, despite the fact that the total rig count is 30% off of those highs. These trends have led to increased demand for our products and services, and provided opportunities to negotiate improved pricing for most of our product service lines that is closer to levels necessary for us to generate adequate returns. Now these increases varied widely across product service lines and basins, and were most evident in those service intensive plays like the Bakken, Haynesville, Eagle Ford and Woodford, where demand for completion equipment has far outstripped capacity. In fact, in the Haynesville and Bakken we are now in 24 hour operations and also an increasing number of jobs are on 24 hours in the Eagle Ford and other gas basins in the Rockies. These operations are providing us with good incrementals to improved equipment utilization while enabling our operator customers to utilize more complex fracture treatments that lower overall program costs. By leveraging this completion demand, we are also able to pull through some of our other services. Natural gas fundamentals are causing concern, coming out of the heating season which may disrupt the current rebound in drilling activity. The resiliency of gas production, despite curtailed drilling activity from peak levels raises the risk of continued pressure on natural gas prices over the next several quarters. In this scenario, we believe drilling in the unconventional basins will take precedence over drilling in the conventional plays, as they generate better returns at lower natural gas prices for our customers. Further, operator hedging positions and the need to drill to hold acreage positions may serve to moderate the rate of the unconventional rig decline. We are also seeing producers shift their portfolio toward unconventional oil in liquid rich gas plays due to the stability of oil prices and higher operator returns for these resources. Completing these wells requires advanced fracturing fluid and completion technology, and also matches the service intensity of the unconventional gas plays. This in effect creates an additional opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves with our customers, and Tim will expand on this in his section. This shift to oil plays is clearly demonstrated by an award from a major EMP for its stimulation work in the Williston Basin. This contract is valued at around $750 million and signifies our customers increasing commitment to oil directed activity, and its desire to work with service companies that offer differentiated technologies. Given these factors, we do not currently anticipate a major correction in the U.S. rig count, but instead believe that levels may be range bound for some period of time. If this occurs, it may restrain our ability to achieve significant further price increases and limit substantial improvements in margins for our North America business for a few quarters. However, our Q1 results did not fully reflect the impact of increased prices that occurred throughout the quarter, and as such we are anticipating modestly improved margins for the second quarter, even if activity holds at current levels. Let me now turn to our international business and start with Latin America. Latin America posted disappointing results for us in the first quarter, primarily due to our operations in Mexico. In our fourth quarter call we discussed the changing landscape in that country as Pemex was modifying their spending profile for both onshore and offshore to meet their production objectives. We expected that these changes could have beneficial implications to Halliburton and decided to keep our cost structure intact to enable us to respond quickly. However, first quarter activity levels further deteriorated as new projects and discrete services work have been significantly delayed, while also winding down a number of the IPM projects. If activity levels in the country do not recover soon, we will adjust our cost structure appropriately and may incur some restructuring charges in the coming quarters. Now turning to the Eastern Hemisphere, Eastern Hemisphere revenue decreased 9% sequentially with declines in both regions. Eastern Hemisphere margins declined to approximately 15%. In our fourth quarter call we reminded everyone of the typical seasonality related declines that historically occur in the first quarter of the year. These items were further exacerbated by harsher than normal weather in Russia, the North Sea and certain parts of Asia. Also project delays and lower activity in certain key markets, such as Algeria, all led to a more than expected contraction of our margins in the first quarter.  Activity declines have also been acute in the UK sector of the North Sea, where drilling activity has dropped to its lowest level in six years. We now anticipate that activity may start picking up from the current levels, as the continued recovery of capital markets provide funding to North Sea operators for their development programs. We had previously indicated that our Eastern Hemisphere margins may trough in the second quarter of 2010. We now believe that our Eastern Hemisphere margins should not deteriorate from current levels, as any additional impact of last year’s re-pricing of contracts could be offset by the activity rebound in the weather affected areas and new project start ups. So despite temperate activity levels in the first quarter, our current visibility to multiple projects is providing us with increased confidence on the trajectory of our international business in the latter half of 2010 and into 2011, although as we said earlier it will be uneven among major markets. We are currently seeing growth momentum in project activity as well as an increase in our win rates.  For example, we saw Q1 order rates for our Completion tools business increase 22% from fourth quarter levels. On top of that, we were recently awarded a contract from an IOC in West Africa for their upper and lower completions work. This win, together with the frac pack and gravel pack completion awards in Brazil we received in Q4, are reinforcing our position in the major deepwater markets. First quarter order rates and these major awards bode well for this product service line toward the latter part of the year and beyond.  We have also been awarded an offshore multiple product line contract in Angola for the provision of cementing production enhancement, completion, wireline and perforating services valued at $1.3 billion. So going forward we will continue to employ the strategies that have driven the expansion of our market position. We will continue to direct our resources and capabilities to the more economic and sustainable unconventional plays in North Africa. We will continue to increase exposure to the industries highest growth markets like deepwater and global unconventional resources. We’ll continue to leverage our service offerings through integrating our technical solutions to provide more value to our customers, and lastly, continue to seek ways to be one of the most cost efficient providers in the industry. Let me turn it over to Mark for some more color on our financial results. Mark?
Mark McCollum:  Thanks Dave, and good morning. Let me provide you with our first quarter operational highlights. I’ll be comparing our first quarter results sequentially to the fourth quarter of 2009. Our revenue in the first quarter was $3.8 billion, up 2% from the fourth quarter. Total operating income for the first quarter was $449 million, up 5% from the previous quarter. Strong growth in North America offset declines in our international business. Our fourth quarter 2009 results included a $50 million charge relating to a receivable settlement in Venezuela. International margins in the first quarter dropped to 14%, with Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America posting margins of 15% and 9% respectively. The margin decline is generally attributable to the seasonality issues and lower pricing that we discussed in the fourth quarter.  In addition, we experienced more inclement weather than normal and project delays in certain locations as Dave previously mentioned. For North America, margins in the first quarter increased from the prior quarter due to strong activity and improved pricing across most basins, with overall incrementals above 40% in both divisions. Margins progressively improved throughout the quarter, and as such, assuming a relatively stable pricing and activity environment, we are anticipating a slight increase in North American margins in the second quarter. Now I’ll highlight the segment results, and note that we have excluded the fourth quarter receivable settlement charge and the operating income comparisons that followed. Completion and Production revenue increased $146 million or 8%, and operating income improved 38% due to strong North America results. Seasonally lower vessel and other activity in the North Sea, Russia, China and Australia in the first quarter offset North America’s strong growth. Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis, North America revenue increased by 23% while operating income tripled, as we have seen activity and pricing rise, especially in the deeper shale basins where increased completions intensity has led to the meaningful absorption of over supplied equipment in the industry. In Latin America, Completion and Production revenue was essentially flat, but operating income increased 26% from improved performance in southern Mexico and Venezuela. In Europe/Africa/CIS, Completion and Production revenue and operating income decreased 9% and 37% respectively due to inclement weather in Russia and lower activity in the North Sea in Algeria, partially offset by increased production enhancement activity in Egypt.  In the Middle East/Asia, Completion and Production posted sequential decreases in revenue and operating income of 8% and 23% respectively due to seasonally lower completion tools sales in Australia and China. This was partially offset by stronger activity in Indonesia and improved operation performance in Oman.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income declined, primarily as a result of seasonally lower direct sales for wireline and Landmark, as well as lower drilling activity in Mexico and Algeria. The lower activity was partially offset by improved North America results. In North America, Drilling and Evaluation’s revenue and operating income increased 12% and 60% respectively, as most of our product service lines continue to benefit from increased horizontal drilling, which grew approximately 30% from the fourth quarter. This has favored our well construction technologies and we expect that this underlying trend will continue. Drilling and Evaluation’s Latin America revenue and operating income declined 12% and 58% respectively from the typical slowdown in Landmark revenues across the region, lower activity in Mexico and lower subsea and testing activity in Brazil. In the Europe/Africa/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income were down 7% and 17% respectively due to lower activity in Algeria and Nigeria and weather related issues in Russia, partially offset by higher offshore drilling services activity in Norway and Angola, and wireline activity in Libya and Egypt. Drilling and Evaluation’s Middle East/Asia revenue and operating income were down 12% and 41% respectively from seasonal declines for Landmark software sales, direct sales in China, as well as lower activity in Southeast Asia. In the first quarter, we completed the mobilization and studded our first wells for the South Ghawar project, and D&E’s improved performance in Saudi Arabia, as well as Kuwait and Oman, helped to offset some of the seasonal declines in other areas. Now I’ll address some additional financial items. As we discussed in our fourth quarter call, we took a charge in the first quarter of approximately $41 million to reflect the impact of the recent impact of the recent devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar. This charge has two components, first, a non-cash exchange loss of $31 million which is not deductible for Venezuelan tax purposes and second, additional income tax expense in Venezuela for our U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities of $10 million. We continue to forecast that our effective income tax rate for the balance of the year will be between 32% and 33%. And finally, we currently expect our capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $2 billion. We have accelerated some of the capital deliveries slated for 2011 into 2010, given our current visibility of the international projects in the latter part of 2010, as well as the equipment we believe will be required to sustain the more service intensive work of our North America business. Tim?
Timothy Probert:  Thanks Mark, and good morning everyone. So let me provide some additional color on the secular trends that Dave mentioned. First, the focus on oil and liquids rich gas plays which is driving increased activity in North America. Oil directed rigs have more than doubled from the trough in 2009 to levels not seen since the 1990’s, now representing close to 35% of total rig count.  In addition, interest has been quite high for the wet gas basins of the Eagle Ford, Granite Wash, Colony Wash and others, which are not fully represented in these numbers. These assets generate higher returns for our customers than dry gas basins because of their liquids content. Extracting liquids from these reservoirs can be challenging due to their low permeability and require technologies such as high conductivity fluids, high performance surfactants and improved fracture placement techniques like pinpoint stimulation that are beneficial to Halliburton’s service mix. These plays are increasingly drilled horizontally and can be quite service intensive. In the Bakken, for example, operators are using over 30 frac stages in the treatment of their wells. The continued growth of activity in these plays may be an important offset for potential weakness in the future natural gas directed activity. Dave also emphasized the importance of integrated services in providing operators the ability to maximize value from their assets in a lower natural gas price environment. A key Halliburton offering is the ability to calculate and visualize stimulated reservoir volume, determined from fracture mapping techniques, including micro-seismic monitoring and tilt meter and fiber optic temperature sensing technologies along the lateral section. Visualizing the stimulated reservoir volume in real time enables changes to be made to the stimulation treatment to increase the estimated ultimate recovery. Halliburton delivers leading evaluation technology to provide operators the ability to minimize stimulation [inaudible], maximize production, and importantly to optimize well bore placement to further help customers improve returns on their assets. Finally, many of you may have seen our press release regarding our intent to establish a new product service line coincident with the acquisition of Boots & Coots. Upon closing, we will merge our well intervention services with the assets of Boots & Coots. This new product service line will focus on growing opportunities in well intervention as operators seek to address their production challenges in both mature and emerging oil and gas basins globally. This acquisition, like the 15 other acquisitions we’ve made in the last two years, is consistent with our articulated strategy of executing both on acquisitions to enhance our market position, coverage and growth. Dave?
David Lesar: Okay. Thanks Tim. And let me just quickly summarize and then we’ll turn it over to questions. The secular trend of service intensity in North America is driving significant improvements in equipment utilization, which is enabling us to implement price increases that lead to strong margin improvement in the first quarter. Going forward, we remain cautious on the natural gas outlook for the next several quarters, but we will continue to direct our resources to those basins that require our differentiated technologies.  International activity has been challenging in Q1. However, there are strong indications that are providing us with a confidence that a steady resurgence may be underway and will continue as we go into 2011. Our strategy remains the same. We will continue to execute our strategy of investing in key markets where we can leverage the breadth of our technology portfolio. We will strive to retain our expanded market position as the industry transitions into the next cycle.  So let’s go ahead and open it up for questions.
Christian Garcia: Yes. Before we open it up for questions, we would like to clarify our statement that one of our strategies that we will employ is to continue to direct our resources and capabilities to the more economic and sustainable unconventional plays in North America and not North Africa. Sean, let’s open it up for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets:  Just on a follow up that I would have here you referenced the North American activity now being relatively flat, you think for the next few quarters. I think heading into the first quarter, if I’m not mistaken, Halliburton may have had some concerns that the rig count may drop and I’ve heard numbers anywhere between 150 to 200 rigs. So I guess maybe to look at it in this context, you think the gas rig count will essentially drop from here and then that will be offset by oil? And the follow up on that means, though, that you’re not going to lose any revenue intensity or service intensity because of the type of oil drilling that’s taking place, I’m just wondering if you could provide a little more color around the mix shift that we’re going to see in North America.
Timothy Probert: Yes, Kurt, this is Tim. I mean clearly we have mentioned on our call and previous calls that we expect the rig count to be ranged down over the course of the next couple of quarters. I think we’ve all been a little surprised at the speed of the shift from dry gas to liquids rich gas activity, and as I mentioned 35% of the land rig count now is directed in that liquid hydrocarbon range. So I think that we see a couple of things. We see a negative downward pressure on dry gas. We see some strong hedge positions. We see also the importance of drill to hold and we see the shift towards liquids plays, which most of the operators are discussing in some detail. So we think generally speaking we will see this range band of activity, dry gas dropping a little, some strength in liquids and the combination being in sort of a reasonably tightly band range.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets:  For Dave, on the international markets you used the word resurgence a couple of different times. What geographic areas do you see surprising to the upside and what do you see potentially surprising to the downside relative to coming into the beginning of the year?
David Lesar: Yes, I mentioned one in particular. I think we’re starting to believe the North Sea will come back. Asia was hit with a series of weather related issues in Q1, so I think we see those projects continuing. West Africa continues to be reasonably strong. Middle East is steady. Algeria is a big wild card right now and things are in a little bit of a flux in that country. It’s a big area of operation for us, so that would be sort of the one wild card I see out there right now, but I wouldn’t point to one particular area as being particularly good or bad. I think the indications are it should be increasing just about everywhere in the Eastern Hemisphere.
Operator: Your next question comes from William Herbert - Simmons & Company International.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company International:  Along the lines of your prophecy here of the steady resurgence in the Eastern Hemisphere activity, could you frame the likely margin evolution and really talk about the prospects for recapturing pricing for the service industry? Probably a ways away, but I’m just curious as to a road map with regard to margins, targeted incrementals and when could we expect to see some positive pricing leverage?
Timothy Probert:
 : Let’s talk first of all a little bit about cost. I mean clearly we have maintained a position in our international markets for a degree of readiness with respect to projects that haven’t exactly happened in the time scale which we would originally have planned. So that clearly is a leverage impact from the cost structure which is in place. I think secondly, you know, once the international market does behave very differently to the North America market, the strength of the North America market does have an impact on the international markets and so the tightening of capacity and supply in North America is a favorable impact long-term, or I should say in the medium term in the international market. So we think there are a couple of variables which cause us to believe that in the Eastern Hemisphere that we have troughed essentially during the course of Q1, Bill.
William Herbert - Simmons & Company International:  So getting back to the evolution, understand the trough, let’s start with Q2. Are margins flat to up in the second quarter with regard to the Eastern Hemisphere or perhaps a bit better than that?
Timothy Probert: I think flat to up would be a good description.
Operator: Your next question comes from Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs: You mentioned that, it sounds like demand is outstripping supply in a number of basins in North America, the Bakken, Haynesville, Eagle Ford and I would assume going forward that’s where your customers will continue to choose to deploy capital. Are there opportunities for you to mobilize equipment from other regions? Will modifications be required? And how do you see this playing out? Are we at a point now where the returns are such that it makes sense to add capacity?
Timothy Probert: Yes, clearly there is a tightening and I think that there is a general sense in some of these basins that our customers are challenged to get the work done in the timeframe in which they would like to do it. And I should sort of emphasize that perhaps this is more oriented towards our stimulation equipment than it is for every product line in which we’re active. But during the course of the year we have certainly undertaken a significant amount of rebalancing of equipment and focusing on those areas where we have the most significant opportunities for the short, medium and long-term. And so we certainly are taking opportunities to relocate equipment where it makes sense for us to do. And as we have told you previously, we have been adding a certain degree of maintenance capital to our fleet to insure that we can meet the challenges of very large, horsepower spreads which are in place today.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs:  On the international market, it did seem that the margins in Middle East/Asia in the D&E division were really the only area that surprised us with the downside relative to what we were expecting. Can you help me understand how much of that was seasonal, how much of it might be related to carrying additional costs as you ramp up for projects in the Middle East? And specifically with that division, with that region, how we should expect margins to play out.
Mark McCollum: Dan, this is Mark. As we said on the call, you know one of the largest seasonal impacts that we experience in the first quarter is always the falloff in our direct sales, which significantly helped the wireline business within D&E as well as our Landmark business as well. And so those two particular changes do have a dramatic impact on the margins for D&E in the first quarter. So we should expect some pickup in the margins and the overall activity for D&E as we get on into the year and those seasonal impacts are overcome.
Timothy Probert: I would just add one thing to Mark’s comment there and that is that we did have one large project startup during the course of the quarter in Asia. The startup process was a little bit more protracted than we had originally anticipated and that did impact our costs substantially during Q1 for D&E.
David Lesar: Also just to add to that, since you’re looking at the Asia/Middle East region, we also had the startup costs on the South Ghawar project which is up and going at this point in time. And we have the continued ramp up and expense of building out our operations in Iraq. So the Middle East/Asia/PAC region basically had to bear all of that cost and a lot of that goes toward the D&E division.
Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs:  So with that, that should be the one region that shows the most improvement sequentially. It sounds like the really only overhang of startup costs really is Iraq and obviously that’s positive for future activity.
Timothy Probert: We certainly hope so.
Operator: Your next question comes from Angie Sedita – UBS.
Angie Sedita - UBS: Dave, you mentioned and we’ve discussed it a little bit already, but tangible signs for a recovery in the international markets in the second half and you’ve pointed to the North Sea as well as West Africa and deepwater. Are you seeing an increase in conversations with your customers? Or could you just give us a little color there on the activity for the second half? And then if you’re expecting more of a driver on the activity side, and pricing more 2011 or potential pricing improvements later this year.
David Lesar: I think, Angie, it’s more than conversations. We’re seeing projects get awarded, we’re seeing rigs get tender and awarded and being moved into places. And so we see these projects actually getting up and moving forward. So I think we see a real tangible effect of an increase in activity. You know as Tim has said, I think on the margin side we did not essentially cut back our infrastructure in any big way in the Eastern Hemisphere and we’ve got to absorb some of that capacity as this revenue streams comes back online. And then I think that with the higher oil prices that are out there today, our customers are just more confident that they can start these larger projects.  And I think it’s important to keep in mind, in the international markets, it’s primarily an oil driven market. The projects today are very, very large and so once they get started there’s essentially no turning back on them. But what our customers have been reluctant to do is start these projects in sort of the oil price environment we saw throughout last year. But we’re confident now they’re getting awarded, they’re going to get started, and once started there’s no turning back.
Angie Sedita – UBS:  Just a follow up on pricing. Clearly pressure pumping in North America has been strong on the pricing side. Where else are you seeing some pricing power due to tight capacity? Is it drill bits, structural tools?
Timothy Probert:
 : Yes. I think as the numbers or the incrementals from North America would suggest, Angie, that certainly in areas of our Drilling and Evaluation business related to the well construction activities we’ve seen, a stronger position there through the course of Q1. So anything really relating to the sort of horizontal activity has been good and we’ve generally sort of started to see improvement even in those product lines where activity has led to sort of very poor and slow movement on pricing such as wireline.
Operator: Your next question comes from James Crandell - Barclays Capital.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital: With you seeing in the U.S. full utilization of your stimulation fleet and I guess pretty full utilization of both directional and cementing, are you to the point where you’re actually trying to restrain price increases? I imagine that at some point you’re going to reach a level that you don’t want at all for things to evolve like they did last cycle, where you and others followed the market up or pushed or helped push it up and attracted a lot more capacity. So are you to the point yet where you’re really trying to restrain things on the stimulation side?
David Lesar: No. Absolutely not, Jim. We’re just now getting back to where we think we’re earning a reasonable return on those assets. You know the scenario you outlined is one that did exist sort of in the last uptick but you know we had pricing pushed down so far that we just frankly weren’t getting our cost to capital back on these assets, even though we continued to invest in them. And we’re now just sort of breaking through that point and we’ve got to be comfortably above that before we would have any discussions along the line of what you suggest.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital:  And do you sense, Dave that people in the industry are beginning to add capacity to the stimulation business, given the heavy wear and tear on equipment?
David Lesar: Well I think, Jim, Tim can comment because he watches that closer than I do, but you put your finger right on it. I mean these shale plays, these unconventional plays still continue to be very, very disruptive to the equipment. And therefore you actually need to build a fair amount of equipment every year just to stay in place with your horsepower capacity. We’re taking 30,000, 40,000 horsepower out to some of these jobs today and so the turnover of your equipment and the maintenance cost is dramatically higher than it has been. So you clearly have to bring more equipment in basically just to replace the fleet that you’re grinding up.
Timothy Probert: Yes, just to add to that Jim, it might be helpful to think in terms of there’s about 7 million horsepower in North America today, based on sort of current estimates. And if you think about requirements for maintenance capital around that particular number, it’s going to be quite significant. Obviously at 5% you’re in the range of 300,000 to 400,000 horsepower per year. So certainly the scuttlebutt is we’re seeing some capacity being added into the market. Lead times for that seem to be in the sort of six to nine month range so it would suggest that, to us at least, that there’s probably going to be a muted addition of capital, certainly in the first three quarters of 2010.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital:  And my second question, Dave, concerns Iraq. At this point do you see other consortiums following the BP lead or waiting until the elections in Iraq are sorted out? And does there seem to be any concern among your customers that the new government might change the terms on this?
David Lesar: Yes, I think we are seeing some tendering activity moving forward and I expect that you would see some awards on that this summer. I think that our customers are taking a bit of a wait and see to see how the new government settles out. I don’t think they’re concerned that there’s going to be a change in terms as much as they’re concerned just about getting a delay and getting their deal signed off on, their tenders agreed to and basically validated by Southern Oil Company or whoever has to sign off on it. But at this point in time, we’re not seeing any diminished enthusiasm for starting up their operations in Iraq.
James Crandell - Barclays Capital:  And Dave, what are you gearing up to in Iraq right now? I think one of your competitors said they expected to have 600 people on the ground at the end of the year. Another one who’s been there longer has talked about having I think eight bases in Iraq right now and then of course a lot more people than 600. How quickly are you gearing up in that country?
David Lesar: Well, we’re in the process of building our first major base there just like our major competitors are and we also have plans for a series of bases. We know where they are. We’re in the process of securing the facilities and the land at this point in time. There’s going to be plenty of work in Iraq and believe me all the service companies will have opportunities there. So we’re going along at the pace we want and we’re confident we’re going to be successful.
Operator: Your next question comes from William Sanchez - Howard Weil Inc.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Inc.: Tim, just to follow back up on the second quarter margin expectations, I guess North America, the R&M that you mentioned here I guess one would expect given that March was probably a very, very good month and that margins were I’m guessing higher than what you average for first quarter North America, even in an environment where pricing from here doesn’t improve radically, the margin improvement should be pretty healthy. And it sounds like its more muted than one would expect and I’m just wondering how much of the impact of that R&M now are you actually going to start seeing in second quarter as opposed to what maybe [inaudible] might have thought would have tempered first quarter margins or incrementals a bit?
David Lesar: Yes. Let me put a little more color on that. First of all, we’re seeing our vendors, our prop in vendors, sand vendors, etc., start to want price increases. So we will have some inflationary pressure on that side of the equation in terms of us getting our price increase. Our vendors are going to want some price increases. You know clearly we are the price leaders, especially in stimulation in North America and your observation is absolutely correct. Our margins in March were higher than the average margins that we had for the quarter. We’re not going to telegraph where our exit margins were or where we believe they can go, just because as a price leader we don’t want to put that out there for competitive reasons.  But I think the issue around the rig count, the issue around probably some reduction in the conventional gas plays, sort of push your rig expectations down. On the other hand, your rich gas and your oil plays push expectations up a little. You throw a little inflation in there and we really want to get through another quarter to really get a more accurate view of where this can go the balance of the year. And as we said, a lot of the repair and maintenance stuff, you know, we’re incurring that right now anyway.
William Sanchez - Howard Weil Inc.:  Just as a follow up, you mentioned you’re the pricing leader on stem. Is it safe to say you’ve also been gaining share here so far this year and expect that to continue into this quarter?
David Lesar: We believe so, but we’ll probably know over the next couple of weeks whether that’s true or not.
Operator: Your next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.: I guess I’d like to get your view on the North American stimulation market in particular here. You know when you talk about the hedging positions and the drilling to hold leases as being a factor in the drilling activity, I’m having a hard time reconciling that with your other comment about the capacity constraints are limiting your customers ability to get their work done in a timely fashion and I guess maybe there’s no difference there, but if there’s a lot of drilling going on to hold leases I guess I’m not quite clear why there’s such urgency to move forward with completion.
Timothy Probert: I think, Geoff, clearly our concern is the current gas pricing fundamentals don’t seem to support the degree of dry gas activity which is underway at the moment. We certainly see that weakening. You know the fact of the matter is that as we move into more liquid areas including sort of true oil shales, there is a significant amount of intensity associated with the delivery of those jobs. And so you know we’re essentially shifting from a gas environment to an oil environment, which has a high degree of intensity. So I think that’s the shift that you’re seeing. But I think that most of us would believe that we will see some softening in the rig count for dry gas which will clearly relieve the pressure on overall service requirement.
Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.:  And I understand it might limit your ability to move prices higher than where they’re maybe sitting right now, but it sounds also as if you expect that pull back in dry gas drilling to be primarily conventional reservoirs and may not have any negative effect on Halliburton’s financial performance.
Timothy Probert: That’s certainly possible, though current rig count performance sort of would indicate that even locations like the Haynesville are actually dropping a few rigs.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup.
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup:  I wanted to turn to Mexico for a minute. Of course you pointed out the very slow start to the year, but didn’t Pemex basically have a budget for this year which was kind of flattish with 2009 and running well below that level now? But how confident are you that activity will pick up later this year and avoid the situation where you need to address your cost structure there?
Timothy Probert: You know I think clearly for the long-term we have a very strong feeling about potential in Mexico. However, as we told you I think during our January call we’re basically holding onto our cost structure in Mexico in anticipation of a number of projects which would be underway in this timeframe, Q1, Q2 timeframe. The lag process which we discussed in January is underway but it is not going to lead to meaningful incremental activity until later this year and we are a little disappointed, clearly, as Dave mentioned earlier, with the rate of development of the market, given the cost structure activity which has been underway in the course of 2009. So we will monitor the process during the quarter of Q2 and take action accordingly.
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup:  And on the integrated project management in the Chicontepec field, have you worked out all the aspects of incentive based fees for that kind of work? And in other words, if you develop clearly superior ways of [inaudible] and completing wells so as to increase productivity in Chicontepec that you are going to share in the economic benefits of that? I’m just asking your understanding of how that’s going to work now.
Timothy Probert: Well really the focus today is the concept which Pemex are calling a lab concept, which really gives an opportunity to take a close look at subsurface and to really establish whether or not there really is a better way to prepare locations essentially to plan wells, as well as to drill and execute them. As to the collaborative approach, together with Pemex to try and identify more productive segments of the reservoir section that might ultimately improve the overall economics for them, which as you know has been a challenge. And so we continue to work very closely with Pemex in that regard, and clearly the combination of subsurface expertise combined with drilling and also with completion expertise is going to be the key differentiator for companies going forward.
David Lesar: But I think, Robin, to answer the question, you know, the reason they’re calling it a laboratory is that we are going to experiment with what may be the best way to drill and complete and produce these wells. And it would be at the end of these laboratory experiments that they will choose one or two companies to work with. And at that point in time, you would work out the incentive based structure that you would use going forward. So these labs don’t really have that in there. It’s to establish the baseline of what you might be able to do going forward and how you would benefit from that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brad Handler - Credit Suisse.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse: Could you guys give us a little more color on Algeria? I don’t want to overstate its relevance but it does seem that the political quagmire and you haven’t made any comments about sort of assessing your commitment to there. So if you could shed some light on that, I’d appreciate it.
David Lesar: Yes. Algeria is a decent size market for us and for the industry, but it’s also a very high cost market. And so you have to have a base of business there to get the kind of returns, base of business in terms of revenue stream, to get the kind of returns you want. And because of some of the issues that are going on within the government and within Sonatrach, a lot of the decision making that would normally move your business along, i.e., the awarding of contracts; the extension of contracts; the approval of subcontractors, etc., is not going on. And so there is another situation where we essentially fully invested and have a very good business but a very high cost structure, and the revenues right now are not sufficient to overcome that cost structure. But there is a market that we’re committed to. We’ve been there a long time and we’re just going to wait for the politics to play out and then we should be able to resume our activities there.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  Do you sense that does all of the leadership have to be kind of released before these projects can move forward? Or is there some middle management process that can kind of progress the projects?
David Lesar: I think what they just have to do is get a structure in place that can approve the awarding of contracts or contract extensions, etc., and then we can move forward. I don’t know what the governance inside Sonatrach is on that, but we’re hopeful that it will be happening fairly soon.
Brad Handler - Credit Suisse:  And an unrelated follow up, please, the two big contracts that you mentioned, the $1.3 billion Angolan work and your Williston basin award, can you tell us over what time you expect to recognize those revenues for both?
Timothy Probert:
 : Good question. I believe that the Angola contracts will be over about a six year period. The North America contract is, I think, four years.
Operator: I’m not showing any other questions at this time, gentlemen.
Christian Garcia: That’s good. That will do it for us. Before we close we would like to announce that Halliburton’s second quarter 2010 earnings conference call will be held on Monday, July 19, 2010 at 9:00 AM U.S. Eastern time. Thank you for your participation in today’s call. Sean?
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Presentation: 
Operator: Welcome to Halliburton’s fourth quarter earnings call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Christian Garcia, Vice President Investor Relations.
Christian Garcia : Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2009 conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton’s website for seven days. The press release announcing the fourth quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are David Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Timothy Probert, President Global Business Lines.  With the planned retirement of David King, President of our C&P Division, Timothy is now responsible for both our Completion and Production and Drilling and Evaluation Divisions, as well as Corporate Development and Technology. We would like to thank David King for his many years of service to the company.  Before turning the call over to David, I would like to remind our audience that some of today’s comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Note that we will be using the term international to refer to our operations outside the US and Canada and we will refer to the combination of US and Canada as North America. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release announcing the fourth quarter results and on our website.
David Lesar : Thank you Christian, and good morning everyone. Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I would like to give a summary of what we accomplished in 2009. First we believe we expanded our market share in all of our major product service lines, by leveraging the shift toward increasing well complexity and by deploying our integrated services strategy.  Second we maintained our technology edge and continued to build our portfolio of key products that will address the industry’s challenge in the coming years. Third we increased our financial strength ending the year with $3.4 billion in cash and marketable securities which provide us the flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they arise.  And by focusing on returns our average invested capital return was 12% which is above our cost of capital despite the significant reduction in industry activity we saw in 2009. So I am satisfied that our results indicate that we have successfully executed against a very challenging environment and met our objectives of strengthening the long-term health of our franchises during this last down cycle.  Now before I go into some of the details on Q4, I’d like to discuss the current environment and how it impacted our Q4 results and how it may impact our business into 2010. Total revenues for the fourth quarter grew 3% from the third quarter driven primarily from growth in North America offset by a decline in our international business.  Landmark software and equipment direct sales experienced their typical increase over Q3. However completion tool sales which historically benefit from remaining year end operator capital funds were impacted by the dramatic reduction in upstream capital expenditures and more proactive inventory management by our customers.  We have outlined for you over the past several quarters that pricing from contract retendering activity in the Eastern Hemisphere in the first half of 2009 would exert downward pressure on our margins and our Q4 results certainly reflect this.  Eastern Hemisphere margins in Q4 declined from 22% to 19%, although a part of this decline was season in nature. We have also stated that this repricing activity would push margins downward into the upper teens in 2010 and we continue to believe that this will be the case.  Our North America business has also started to rebound as conditions have improved. Margins were up sequentially to 7%. Equipment utilization is starting to pick up and we are starting to get some price increases. The trends toward increasing levels of service intensity is also playing in our favor and we believe we could be poised for a much better North America market in 2010.  And I don’t think anyone is better positioned than Halliburton to benefit from this. However this view requires a sustained increase in natural gas drilling activity. It will be important how we exit the heating season with storage levels in line with historical averages and have some increased recovery in industrial demand.  So far the signs are mostly positive but we will certainly know more at the end of the first quarter. Our Latin America business has experienced some unique challenges. Our fourth quarter operating results were impacted by the slowdown in natural gas drilling in Mexico and though activity has picked up somewhat it has not approached the level we saw in the third quarter.  Pemex has stated that 2010 capital spending will be flat with 2009 though we’ll be more focused on offshore and production optimization. At this point it looks like Pemex will assume a greater role in decisions by signing services work based more on performance than a low price IPM bid.  But since it is still unclear what the scope of work will be in Mexico, we are essentially keeping our cost structure in tact to ensure that we have the flexibility to respond. This obviously impacted our Q4 margins in Latin America and will continue to do so in 2010 until we can determine which direction the Mexico market is going and at that time we’ll adjust our cost structure if its appropriate.  Venezuela will be impacted in Q1 of 2010 by currency devaluations and [Pedavasis] overall spend rate. Argentina continues to be impacted by union issues. However Brazil is a bright spot as we continue to win work and grow in that country. So all in all I believe the bias in Latin America for 2010 will be toward a more challenging margin environment as the region seems to be currently over supplied with equipment.  Let me now discuss our Q4 results in more detail starting with our international business, our international revenues registered an overall decline of 2% due to the impact of pricing on contract retenders, a decline in natural gas drilling activity in Mexico, and the typical weather related seasonality we see in the North Sea and Russia.  Operating income was also adversely effected by a charge arising from the settlement of a significant portion of our customer receivable in Venezuela. As I said earlier, in the fourth quarter one very bright spot for us was in Brazil where revenues grew 19% sequentially due to increased drilling and testing activities.  We also received an extension for our directional drilling and LWD contracts. I’m also pleased to announce that we recently won the largest package on the intensely sought after tender for gravel pack completions with Petrobras. This major completions win comes on the heels of Halliburton being awarded 100% of the frac pack completions work for Petrobras.  These wins not only provide us incremental business for Brazil but also solidify our position as the deepwater completions leader. Last month we announced the signing of a technology cooperation agreement with Petrobras for reservoir research and development. The agreement will initially cover three research projects aimed at improving the efficiency and attractiveness of reservoir exploration offshore.  These and other technology projects will be developed in the company’s planned new technology center in Rio. We currently feel that 2010 will be a period of transition in the international marketplace. Oil fundamentals are improving as weak hydrocarbon demand recovers and the timing and rate of reinvestment remains uneven across geographies and customers.  We have not yet felt the full impact of pricing concessions that were negotiated during last year’s contract retendering process. We’re seeing our customers try to remain flexible in their spending patterns and they continue to be heavily focused on restraining inflation and oilfield services. And Timothy will give a little bit more color on that in a couple of minutes.  Let me now say some things about North America, our revenues grew 12% sequentially due to increased activity. The Rockies experienced a typical weather related issue which we expect to persist somewhat into Q1. In the third quarter we reported that we believe that there was a backlog of about 1300 to 1500 drilled but uncompleted wells.  Our US land results suggest that operators may have worked down a large of portion of this backlog as completion activity disproportionately picked up in Q4. A good portion of the decline in the backlog is in the Barnett Shales, where we saw a reduction to the number of uncompleted wells of approximately 38%. In the fourth quarter it appeared that smaller competitors shifted their equipment especially their pressure pumping equipment to opportunities in less challenging basins and provided us and the industry a temporary tightness in the supply of equipment to service the work in the harsher shale environment.  This coupled with increasing activities from operators working down their backlog of uncompleted wells to strengthening oil basins all provided opportunities for some price increases. Pricing may continue to modestly improve throughout the first quarter but longer-term strengthening of prices will be dependent on a sustained recovery of natural gas fundamentals.  For the other product lines pricing is generally stabilized across most basins. Pricing for wireline while is it improving, remains the weakest as vertically directed activity experienced the least recovery in the US. Our Gulf of Mexico business recovered from the depressed levels in the third quarter and experienced only a minor disruption from hurricanes.  We have made considerable progress in expanding our offshore well construction capabilities and have benefited from the influx of deepwater rigs into the Gulf of Mexico. So we’re very excited about our prospects for 2010. However Q1 will be impacted by a number of items, one, the typical seasonal decline from lower landmark and direct equipment sales, and weather related seasonality for the North Sea, Russia, and the Iraqi mountains.  Two, as I said earlier we are going to maintain our cost structure in Mexico until we have a clearer picture of the direction that Pemex will take. Third, we are continuing to ramp up our cost structure in Iraq where we are starting to build infrastructure. We now have equipment and people on the ground in Iraq, are in the process of hiring and training additional employees.  We have secured contracts with the Southern Oil Company and are now discussing contracts with a number of IOCs and NOCs about starting work later this year. We expect to make investments of approximately $100 million in Iraq in 2010 with revenues from this market to come in late 2010 and beyond.  Next item impacting Q1 will be mobilization costs on contracts that we won in 2009 that will start in early 2010. These contracts include mobilization for the turnkey drilling contract for South Ghawar, in Saudi Arabia, the startup of our large fluids contract that we won in Indonesia, and of course startup costs for the recently awarded completions contracts in Brazil.  Although these mobilization costs will weigh on our results for the first quarter, they certainly are an indication of the robustness of activity for the remainder of 2010. We are estimating that these first quarter items will have an impact of approximately $0.07 to $0.10 on our Q1 which is certainly more than we usually experience going into a first quarter.  In addition to these operational elements, we estimate that the recent Venezuela currency devaluations could translate to about a $30 million exchange loss in Q1 and Mark will discuss this in a couple of minutes.  So in summary, we’ve had a very successful 2009. We expanded our market position, and we’re continuing our current strategy of investing in key segments trying to maintain our financial flexibility. Our challenge in 2010 is to retain the gains we’ve achieved while ensuring that we have organizational flexibility for any changes the market might throw at us.  Let me throw it over to Mark now. 
Mark McCollum : Thanks David, and good morning. Let me provide you with our fourth quarter operational results and I’ll be comparing our fourth quarter results sequentially to the third quarter of 2009. Our revenue in the fourth quarter was $3.7 billion, up 3% from the third quarter, while operating income declined 10% to $428 million.  The decline in operating income resulted from lower international pricing, the impact of reduced activity in Mexico and the $15 million receivables settlement charge David mentioned earlier partially offset by higher North American activity. The charge relates to a settlement we reached with [Petavasa] to receive payment of approximately one third of our outstanding receivables in Venezuela.  Our third quarter results included approximately $28 million in employee separation costs. Now I’ll highlight the segment results and note that we have excluded the receivables settlement charge and the third quarter employee separation costs in the operating income comparisons that follow.  Completion and production revenue remained flat sequentially as higher stimulation and cementing activity was offset by decreased completion tool sales in the fourth quarter, a decline in North Sea vessel activity and lower international pricing.  Overall completion and production operating income declined 32% from the flow through of lower completion tools and vessel revenues partially offset by higher margins in US land. Looking at completion and production on a geographic basis, North America revenue increased 14% while operating income increased significantly from higher US land activity and modest price increases.  In Latin America completion and production revenue declined 8% and operating income fell substantially driven by lower gas drilling in the Burgos basin in Mexico. This decline was partially offset by higher activity in Argentina and Brazil. In Europe/Africa/CIS completion and production revenue and operating income declined 12% and 44% respectively due to seasonal decline in Russia, and reduced vessel, completion tool sales, and pipeline and process services activity in the North Sea and West Africa.  The decline in vessel activity in the fourth quarter was consistent with historical seasonal patterns and our guidance we gave you last quarter. In Middle East/Asia completion and production posted sequential decreases in revenue and operating income of 11% and 47% respectively due to the timing of production enhancement projects in India and Australia, lower completion tool sales, and overall pricing in Saudi Arabia, Southeast Asia, and India.  In our drilling and evaluation division revenue and operating income increased by 6% and 9% respectively on sequential growth in North America and Europe/Africa. Software and asset solutions and wireline led the product service lines with double-digit growth from third quarter levels. In North America drilling and evaluation revenue increased 9% while operating income increased over 80% as our well construction product service lines benefited from the influx of deepwater rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.  In addition the division continued to benefit from the favorable mix toward horizontal drilling, notably in the Haynesville, Marcellus, and Eagle Ford shales. Drilling and evaluations Latin America revenues increased 5% while operating income declined 29%. The flow through of reduced gas drilling in Mexico was offset by increased wireline and testing jobs in Brazil.  In the Europe/Africa/CIS region drilling and evaluation revenue and operating income were up 9% and 10% respectively driven by project management work in Algeria, and a better mix toward higher margin drilling fluids activity in Norway. Drilling and evaluations Middle East/Asia revenue was flat with operating income increasing by 5% as higher margin direct sales in Asia offset timing of projects and lower pricing across the Middle East. Now I’ll address some additional financial items, we continue to generate positive cash flows. In the fourth quarter our cash, equivalents, and marketable securities increased by approximately $200 million resulting in a $3.4 billion balance as of December 31, 2009. Our current net debt to total capitalization ratio continues to decline and is now 9% at the end of the year.  In 2009 our focus on managing working capital levels has resulted in cash flows from operating activities of $2.4 billion, which includes the $417 million payment for the Department of Justice settlement we entered into earlier in the year.  Excluding this payment operating cash flows would have exceeded the level achieved in 2008 which is notable given the significant reduction in net income in 2009. As we proceed into 2010 we’ll continue to operate within our cash flows to enable us to make the necessary investments while providing us the flexibility to adapt to changes in the marketplace.  Within this objective we currently expect our capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $1.7 to $1.8 billion which we believe will provide the equipment necessary to support activity levels we currently expect in 2010 and coming years.  As David mentioned we are anticipating an exchange loss of approximately $30 million in the first quarter of 2010 to reflect the impact of the recent devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. This estimate is based on the balance of our believer based net monetary asset position in the country at December 31, 2009 and our currency understanding of how the new two exchange rate system will work for the oil services activity. This exchange loss is nondeductible for tax purposes which results in a negative impact to our first quarter income taxes. In addition we expect to incur additional income taxes in Venezuela for our US dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities of approximately $10 million which will also be reflected in our first quarter 2010 tax provision.  So given these devaluation impacts we currently expect our first quarter 2010 effective tax rate to be in the range to 34% to 35%. Our estimated effective tax rate for the remaining quarters of 2010 is 31% to 32%. Finally we anticipate that our 2010 corporate expenses will continue to run about $50 to $55 million per quarter and we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $250 to $260 million per quarter or a little above $1 billion in total for 2010.
Timothy Probert : Thanks Mark, and good morning everyone. As David mentioned our current outlook for 2010 remains fluid and growth will be uneven but within geographic and customer segments. However we can make some observations on our customers’ spending patterns which provide us with an indication of the scope of a potential rebound in activity.  First in the international market, our IOC customers have generally maintained consistent spending levels through the downturn and indications are that as a group their spending levels into 2010 will be flat. This assertion seems to be supported by several of the current spending surveys.  The amount of work accomplished under these spending levels will benefit from cost deflation though. These customers are also exhibiting an intense focus on the quality of execution to further improve project economics.  A number of NOC customers have announced healthy growth rates in their upstream capital expenditures for this coming year. We should be mindful though that the announced plans are subject to a number of external factors, political and economic, which can influence the timing of their spending patterns.  Both customer segments are directing a significant portion of their spending into new frontier developments such as Iraq, deep and ultra deepwater projects and production type infrastructure. The trajectory of sanction projects moving through our internal opportunity management system indicates that after a marked decline in tender activity in Q1, 2009 tender activity gradually increased through the year.  For Halliburton consistent with a typical lag from sanctioning through award to execution, will experience a number of significant project startups from the end of Q1 onwards. This together with the pattern of spending from our IOC and NOC customers suggest improving international activity in the second half of 2010 and into 2011. Turning to North America the shift towards deeper unconventional shales is well understood and it’s an important component of rising service intensity in the US drilling and completion activity. Interestingly the shift towards increasing numbers of fracture stages, at higher pressures and rates in these deeper shale basins is having a positive impact on Halliburton’s [inaudible] fleet utilization.  Halliburton’s horsepower [inaudible] per job increased by 30% to 40% in 2009 and the number of crews on 24-hour operations has increased significantly in select basins. We believe this technology trend will persist as operators seek to improve productions, assisting the absorption process of over supplied equipment in 2009.
David Lesar: Okay, then just a quick summary and then we’ll open it up for questions. We’ve obviously seeing opportunities to increase pricing in North America as we benefit from our technology, our footprint, and the capital investments we made through 2009.  In the international market as we previously have guided international margins are being impacted by the contract retendering process and this will persist throughout 2010. Our first quarter margins will be particularly effected by increased mobilization costs for project startups and the usual drop off of software and equipment sales.  However we view 2010 as a fluid market, we’re excited about where we are, we believe we have successfully executed against our strategy, and certainly are well positioned to benefit as activity rebounds.  Let’s go ahead and open it up for questions now. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company 
Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company : I’m curious here with regards to the guidance and what that means with regard to international margins, we were looking at my model, that 17.5% margins in the fourth quarter for international it looks like given your commentary we’re down 300 to 400 basis points quarter on quarter, should Q1 be the bottom in international margins. 
David Lesar : I think as we said in the call, we think that and I think we need to make a distinction between international and the Eastern Hemisphere, the Eastern Hemisphere we believe will bottom out in sort of the high teens area as I said this morning and that’s very consistent with where we’ve been trying to guide our investor community over the past several quarters. I think if you look at where we think margins, Eastern Hemisphere or international and the difference being you throw Latin America in there, I think we’re seeing mid 2010, it may not be as early as the second quarter, could be into the third quarter, but I think the middle quarters of 2010 will be where it bottoms out and then it should get better from there. 
Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company : Are you all effectively guiding towards a very low 20’s number for the first quarter.  
Mark McCollum : Well if you go back to third quarter when we were at 22%, we tried to articulate at that point in time that that 22% was a bit abnormal. That 20% was really the starting point from which we were giving the guidance that we felt like it was going to fall into the mid teens. 
Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company : What I meant was not margin, earnings per share. 
Mark McCollum : Well I don't know that we give earnings per share guidance so I’m sorry you’ll have to calculate that on your own. We continue to hold that the Eastern Hemisphere margins should fall over the next several quarters into the high teens, Latin America, until we know exactly where Pemex is going to go with their drilling plans, to be a bit more choppy but I think that overall, we’ll continue to hold the guidance that we’ve been giving over the last several quarters. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Boyd – Goldman Sachs
Dan Boyd – Goldman Sachs: I just want to start by clarifying something, on the $0.07 to $0.10 of EPS decline next quarter, does that include the devaluation in Venezuela. 
Mark McCollum : No it does not. The devaluation is on top of that. We sort of see that as a non-recurring one-time event which we were taking into consideration outside of the $0.07.
Dan Boyd – Goldman Sachs: And then as we move towards the second quarter and given that a lot of this comes from mobilization charges, how much of that $0.07 to $0.10 do you think you can make up. Do you think you can make up all of it and grow on top of those project startups or does it take to the third quarter. 
David Lesar : I think if you look at the revenue stream on the startups will come into the second quarter so I think the hit is Q1, the revenue starts in Q2 and beyond and clearly the way they were bid, we’ll eventually make it all up and so I’m not concerned about that. Its just the timing with respect to the startup and obviously you’ll have some positive offset because I think certainly we’re seeing and will see a better Q1 in North America.  So I think, you’ll have to sort of put it all together into your model, but we’re trying to give you enough data points to come up with your own estimates. 
Dan Boyd – Goldman Sachs: And one follow-up on North America, very strong incremental margins in D&E this quarter, how much of that would we attribute to mix with the US Gulf of Mexico versus maybe pure operating leverage and can we view those types of incremental margins as a leading indicator for what we could we see on the C&P side. 
Timothy Probert : From the D&E perspective we certainly did see a significant improvement in Q4 over Q3 as we started to see the influx much awaited of the [older] rigs coming into the Gulf of Mexico so it did certainly have a positive impact. With respect to C&P margins, they clearly do not benefit in the same timeframe, obviously a time lag with respect to the Gulf of Mexico. 
Dan Boyd – Goldman Sachs: We should expect those to improve as looking at D&E as a leading indicator. 
Timothy Probert : Yes, I think that’s a reasonable assumption. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Handler – Credit Suisse
Brad Handler – Credit Suisse: Could you just clarify for us in terms of international recontracting, how much of that is still going on today and therefore you’ve obviously given a lot of clarity on where you think margins are headed internationally, I guess I’m just curious about the pricing pressure as it exists today relative to where things were and how much active recontracting is going on. 
David Lesar : I guess the retendering if you will, or repricing, that effort for the most part I believe is behind us because I think what customers were doing was taking advantage of the down dip we were seeing almost exactly at this time a year ago. Then as oil prices recovered during the year, we saw less and less of it going on. There was some lag among customers as to when they went about this process but I would say that by the end of the year it was mostly behind us, however, I think if you look at the tendering activity that took place toward the end of last year and it taking place today, that tendering activity essentially reflects the pricing that a lot of customers saw in the retendering process they went through.  So I think that its going to take awhile for the margins to stabilize around what they’re going to look like on a recurring basis before we can have an opportunity to push them up. I think in talking with customers they’re more opportunistic especially those that are focused on oil basins around the world and with oil prices where they are today, I think that you’re going to see a fairly robust level of activity going forward. But its going to take a bit of time I think before we get some upward pricing momentum with respect to Eastern Hemisphere but as we indicated, we don’t see the margins ever troughing below the high teens and that’s not a bad place to start the next leg up as far as I’m concerned. 
Brad Handler – Credit Suisse: Could I ask an unrelated follow-up on Iraq please, can you just calibrate for us what you think in terms of contract awards relative to the upcoming election and then presuming that the setting up of a parliament passing law, oil revenue sharing law etc. Do you expect to see some contracts before that is set, i.e. in the first half of the year, or do you expect to kind of wait until things settle out in those political regards, i.e. second half of the year. 
David Lesar : I think there’ll be a, I think its sort of yes to both questions. I think we will see contract awards from our customers but I’m not sure that they will start drilling until after they see what the election results are. I’ve spent the last couple of weeks talking with senior execs of almost every IOC and NOC that has a potential contract in Iraq. Some have got their contracts approved by the Parliament and are moving forward but I think its fair to say that the first part of this year at least as far as we’re concerned, and I suspect for most of the other service companies, is going to be a time of investment with very little revenue but everybody planning to sort of hit the starting line somewhere in the back half of 2010 and its clear that that if that happens there is not going to be enough equipment and people and infrastructure on the ground to handle everything. So its going to be a bit of a land rush once it gets started but I think most of our customers are saying they want to get the political process behind them before they’re going to start expending a significant amount of money. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co.
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co.: I guess it’s a definitional question but you’ve referred to high teens for international margins a few times, 19% seems like high teens, could you kind of clarify the range that high teens covers. 
David Lesar : I guess 15% would not be high teens and 20% would be outside of the high teens, so somewhere in between there. How’s that. 
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co.: So 16% to 19%, we’ve got that bounded. And with back of the envelope calculation, $100 to $130 million of startup costs expecting to be hit in the first quarter, seems quite large. Is there something unusual about the nature of the contracts that you’re starting up in the first quarter, particularly considering one of them that you mentioned was Ghawar where I thought part of the theory there was that you were already on the ground with infrastructure, personnel, equipment, and so on.
David Lesar : Remember the list I gave also included the normal seasonal drop off of direct sales and landmark sales and that’s included in there and that’s obviously a big chunk of that $0.07 to $0.10. For instance last year the drop off from Q4 to Q1 in landmark and direct sales I think was like $0.05 or $0.06 of that.  So the whole thing is not mobilization costs. We were trying to give you a sense of we have normal seasonal drop off, we have mobilization costs, that whole list, investment in Iraq, all of that was inclusive of that $0.07 to $0.10. 
Mark McCollum : If you go back and study historical patterns, even at the top of the cycle, the Q4 to Q1 seasonal impacts typically are about $0.05.
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co.: I misunderstood then, I thought that that was being attributed to the contract startups primarily. 
David Lesar : Let me, maybe we weren’t clear when we did it. I think the $0.07 to $0.10 is basically seasonal drop off, maintaining our cost structure in Mexico, the mobilization costs, and the incremental investments in Iraq. All those will add up to $0.07 to $0.10. 
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co.: And you have mentioned a few times that completion tool sales were lower than expected in the fourth quarter, just in regards to the composition of products, you’ve got software, you’ve got other products, and then you’ve got completion tool sales, was it only the third part of that that was lower than expected in the fourth quarter. 
Timothy Probert : With respect to our software sales, it was particularly strong, actually sort of Q3 to Q4 change for software was actually stronger than has been typical of our Q3 to Q4 change so obviously it all goes for a slightly larger drop as you go from Q4 to Q1.  And yes, completion sales at the end of the year were a little bit more disappointing. I think partially to do with timing, Q3 was particularly strong. And as you know we are a cyclical business in that as drilling activity drops, completion activity tends to drop a quarter to a quarter and a half later. And I think to some extent this is a little bit reflective of the declines that we’ve seen in the international market. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Urban – Deutsche Bank
Michael Urban – Deutsche Bank: Your outlook in North America certainly seems more positive than what we’ve seen in the last couple of quarters and certainly more positive than what we heard from Schlumberger on Friday, it seems to me that demand alone doesn’t necessarily get us back to normal levels of storage, is it something else on the production side maybe working through the completions which you talked about, are you seeing declines in existing production finally accelerating in line with what we might have thought historically. Just wanted to get a little more color on that. 
David Lesar : I think as we tried to allude in the call, I think we’ll know a lot more about where the US market is going to go at the end of the first quarter with wherever storage is at that point in time and sort of the emotion of where the US economy may be heading.  I think that all being said, I do believe that we are better positioned in North America than a lot of the other services companies, one given our footprint, two given our ability to sell an integrated solution and an integrated approach around the production and completion on the especially the shale types of properties.  And I think one of the things that people keep missing in the shale plays is yes, there’s a lot of potential production there and we don’t know how long lived the assets are but believe me to get that resource out of the ground is consuming services equipment very dramatically and as Timothy said, we have to take more horsepower to every job. We are grinding that horsepower up faster than we ever have and so I think that as we see maybe some of the smaller players get their equipment used up by going into these shale plays or as we said in the call they’re actually going away from the shale plays because it is using their equipment up, we just think we’ll have an opportunity to get the supply demand balance for equipment in a little better situation and that will give us a little pricing power at that point in time.  But at the end of the day its really is going to mean a sustained sort of pull on natural gas in the US and as we say, the signs are positive right now but I think we’ll know a lot more in three months. 
Michael Urban – Deutsche Bank: And shifting over to the international side, I would certainly tend to agree that second half and into 2011 is much stronger, but you talked about an uneven recovery, what markets would you see being recovering faster, or more quickly and where does, what markets might it take a little while longer. 
Timothy Probert : A couple of general points, first of all with respect to major projects which have been deferred, take some time to come back to steam so to speak and so it is going to take a quarter or so to get some of these projects back on to boil.  Secondly we are starting to see some indications that anywhere we have land rig activities, there are certainly some upticks in the Middle East, North Africa which is showing some positive signs and these are good leading indicators I think of some positive trends for the second half of 2010.
David Lesar : Plus I think there’s enough data out there, just follow the deepwater rigs and where they’re going because we’ve got a very strong deepwater position so as these rigs have come on toward the end of last year and there’s more coming on this year, clearly we will get our share of that deepwater market as it starts to develop. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell – Barclays Capital 
Jim Crandell – Barclays Capital : Let me go back to Iraq and start there, do you think that you’re, there’s apparently so much business here that could come in the second half, other companies have reentered Iraq either well before you or just before you, do you consider your recent entry back into Iraq to be an impediment on winning some of these contracts. 
David Lesar : No, absolutely not. I think that if there’s more discussion around and actuality of what’s on the ground in there and I think our view is there’s going to be plenty of work for everyone. I think most of our customers really have not decided on a contracting philosophy at this point in time. I think it will tend to be an IPM or a turnkey drilling sort of a market because I believe our customers will want to limit the number of their people and service people on the ground around security issues.  And certainly there has been a company or so that may be has been ahead of us with respect to infrastructure but I just don’t see it holding us back. And I don’t think that anybody will get any real appreciable level of revenues in there probably until the back half of this year.  But then it could really take off but as I said, I think there’s going to be enough work for everybody. 
Jim Crandell – Barclays Capital : Is the work that you’re doing for South Oil, is that IPM work or is that just providing discreet services on one of their fields. 
Timothy Probert : That’s discreet services. 
Jim Crandell – Barclays Capital : Could you address the whole area of deepwater, Schlumberger’s call I think used some wording like they were very pleased with how they were doing on deepwater tenders and maybe specifically addressed it to [inaudible] and how you feel they’re doing so far in the deepwater area. 
Timothy Probert : We’ve got some 28 rigs which are destined to arrive in 2010 and sort of a like number, slightly less 25 or so in 2011. And we are very pleased with our position in deepwater through well construction, through completions and production so we feel we’ve got a very good offering.  We feel that we’re very well positioned and we’ve had a very good win rate so we’re equally pleased to see the degree of focus on deepwater in 2010 and 2011.
Jim Crandell – Barclays Capital : On Iraq, is it your impression in talking with the companies that they tend to view the first phase of work as sort of a first tranche of work which might encompass, might be like a two year contract and really each contract at least to be major fields on average could be even well over a billion dollars. 
David Lesar : I think the discussion we’re having is everyone is trying to get their 10% increment met so they can start getting cost recovery and that is where it kicks in. Actually the discussions we’re having is not sort of time based contracts but it’s a well based contract so we want to bring, company X will say we want to bring two rigs in and knock out 10 wells and we believe that will get us our 10% increment.  Then we will sit back and do a lot more well engineering, a lot more planning, to get up to these higher increments where their bonus payments will kick in. So I see it as a two-phase type of effort but I don’t think its going to be as time based as it is going to be basically a volume based contract. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup: Wanted to go back to North America for a minute, in terms of the drilled but uncompleted wells where you saw some of the backlog work down and clearly it seems that you benefited from that in the fourth quarter, do you continue to see that in the current quarter and do you see any situation similar to what we had before where wells are being drilled but still not completed or adding to that backlog. 
Timothy Probert : At the end of Q3 we thought there was around 1300 to 1500 drilled but uncompleted wells. And if you take a look at the North America completion activity from Q3 to Q4, that was up about 19% though rig activity was only up about 14%. So that suggests that 400 or 500 were probably knocked out during the course of Q4.  And certainly we will have seen some more knocked out during the course of January so we kind of feel right now that the drilled but not completed is sort of starting to get back down to sort of what you might consider to be more normal levels by the time we get towards the end of Q1.  We won’t know obviously until we get the data but that’s the way it would seem to us at the present. 
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup: And you’re not seeing any more situations where wells are being drilled but completion is deferred.  
Timothy Probert : That’s not evident this quarter. 
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup: And then on the pressure pumping capacity the wear and tear that you described on these harsh fracs, is part of your CapEx for 2010 that you mentioned going to replace or is there a significant piece of additional pressure pumping capacity for North America that’s part of that given this issue you discussed.
David Lesar : I think what we’re doing is we’re actually reconfiguring the pumping fleet and what we’re building and we are building almost exclusively now what we call our HT2000 unit which is a very heavy and high horsepower unit specifically made to operate in these heavy shale environments and so that’s really going to be where the focus of the capital spend is for 2010.  But its also fair to say that if you look at sort of the retirements we had last year and using up of equipment, I also think that the supply of pressure pumping equipment as an industry is going down a lot faster than people think, hence, basically the heavy call that we’re seeing on equipment today especially in the shales. 
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup: And some pricing power that’s associated—
David Lesar :  And the beginning of some pricing power specifically in the shale plays. 
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley: Just to follow-up on these 1300 to 1500 uncompleted wells that have seen 400 to 500 completions in the fourth quarter, there’s been I think a general surprise in the natural gas markets to the extent of production holding up despite the rig count falling, could you share your views on what impact this particular event have played in your mind to trigger that production sustainability. 
Timothy Probert : Well certainly we have also been surprised at how well production has held up. I think certainly a quarter or so ago we would have predicted a different outcome. But I think that clearly working this backlog off during the course of Q4 and Q1 is a net positive at the end of the day. Obviously its caused some tightening of supply and it is after all kind of a one-time event in that once its gone its largely gone.  So we would consider it to be a net positive. With respect to the overall supply side, clearly you see a range of models out there and we’re certainly surprised last month with last month’s data. It remains to be seen how we will continue to see that going forward. I’m afraid its anyone’s guess at the moment. 
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley: So you wouldn’t necessarily believe that come February March data that we could get a surprise the other way given that this inventory is then worked off and there’s no incremental impact, you don’t think it’s a big enough event to move the needle. 
Timothy Probert : Its possible, but I think we sort of certainly need to see a little bit more data and we clearly would hope to see some incremental demand and as David mentioned with respect to the overall health of the US natural gas business that’s what we’re going to need to see as we exit Q1 and I think the whole matter is a little bit of an unknown at the moment. 
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley: You did a very good job of outlining everything that sequentially would go negative seasonality into the first quarter as well as the startup costs and all of it adding up to $0.07 to $0.10, but if we look outside North America are there any positive offsets such as larger contracts starting in Brazil or West Africa or deepwater or North Africa or anywhere else for that matter that could offset this on the top line. 
Timothy Probert : I think we have a number of significant startups. As I was explaining the tender activity increased nicely and steadily during the course of 2009 after a very slow Q1 and all these projects have startup dates which are either in the end of Q1 or into Q2 and so really it’s a question of timing.  One of the effects that we tend to see as a service company is what I call I call rubber banding effect where projects just simply do tend to err on the side of delay rather than coming forward. But there does come a point when psychology changes and those projects tend to happen on time again.  And so I think it’s a question of how our customers see their sense of urgency with respect to the projects and that will determine whether or not we see them earlier which would create some upside, or later which would be fairly consistent with what we’ve outlined to you.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley: But are you trying to say that we should be looking at an outlook that there’ll be $0.07 to $0.10 down outside North America sequentially and any mitigating factor would all have to be with North America pressure pumping. 
Timothy Probert : I think we’ve tried to do our best to outline how we see the international markets at present. We outlined what we see in Latin America, we’ve outlined what we see in the Eastern Hemisphere so with respect to any material changes North America probably has the greater visibility at the present time for upside. 
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley: And finally one question on North America, you mentioned that equipment is being trued up at a rapid clip in the pressure pumping market, something that we completely agree with, against that backdrop do you think that [inaudible] margin in the completion side is acceptable. What would be a margin that would just allow you to generate the return on capital that you need in order to keep on investing in the North America pumping capacity. 
David Lesar : In sort of a simple way, we look at our cost of capital of being around 10% or 11% so we’ve got to be convinced that anything we buy or build is going to be able to exceed that cost of capital over the life of that particular asset. And as you know we’ve been very, very focused on returns on our business, returns for our shareholders, and I think we have done a very good job through the past several years and including 2009 in hitting those capital goals.  So if we didn’t feel positive about getting that return we would not be building this stuff, so I think you can take some comfort in that. 
Christian Garcia: That will do it for us, before we close I would like to announce that Halliburton’s first quarter 2010 earnings conference call will be held on Monday, April 19, 2010 at 9:00 am US Eastern time. Thank you for your participation in today’s call.

===== 2009 Q3  (2009-10-16 09:00:00) =====
Executives: Christian Garcia – Vice President Investor Relations David J. Lesar – Chairman of the Board, President & Chief Executive Officer Mark A. McCollum – Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President Timothy J. Probert – President of Drilling and Evaluation Division & Corporate Development
Analysts : Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company International Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co. Brad Handler – Credit Suisse

Operator:
Christian Garcia : Welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2009 conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available at Halliburton’s website for seven days. The press release announcing the third quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President Drilling and Evaluation Division and Corporate Development. I’d like to remind our audience that some of today’s comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2008, our Form 10Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 and current reports on Form 8K. Note that we will be using the term international to refer to our operations outside the US and Canada and we will refer to the combination of US and Canada as North America. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release announcing the third quarter results.
David J. Lesar : Here’s a summary of our overall results for the third quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter grew 3% from the second quarter and represents the first sequential revenue increase we’ve experienced since the fourth quarter of 2008. Most of our product service lines registered sequential growth from the prior quarter with software and asset solutions and production enhancement showing mid to high single digit growth from second quarter levels. Our international business registered an overall revenue increase of 3% despite a 1% decline in the rig count from the prior quarter. While there is a risk of further decline in international activity in the coming quarters I am more optimistic than I was previously that this downturn will not match previous cycles in terms of duration and depth. However, we believe operators will not materially increase their spending levels despite stable commodity prices without compelling evidence of recovery in hydrocarbon demand. As a result, they continue to reduce capital expenditures by deferring projects and exerting pressures on the oil service companies to improve their project economics. In North America the market continues to be challenging. Natural gas fundamentals remain fragile despite the first signs of a supply response resulting from the severe curtailment in drilling activity. Weak domestic gas demand coupled with the productivity of the new shale resources has led to gas storage reaching record levels. We believe that a significant improvement in the natural gas market in the next few quarters is unlikely without the resurgence of a broad market economic demand in support of winter withdrawal and supply patterns. While we suspect that the industry will see accelerating production declines in the coming months in response to reduced drilling activities, we don’t believe these declines will be adequate to provide a meaningful near term correction of the current supply and demand imbalance. Despite these challenges, we are continuing to successfully execute our strategy implemented at the beginning of the downturn to navigate through this environment by aligning our resources to those areas that best leverage our differentiated technologies. Let’s discuss now in more detail the international and North American markets. The international revenue grew 3% sequentially and now represents 64% of our total business. We saw double digit sequential growth in the North Sea, the Northern Gulf and the Middle East and Russia. For example, our Russian revenues 18% sequentially and it is clear that the Russian market bottomed from the depressed levels in the first quarter. Production has not declined as feared with production coming on stream from Greenfield areas such as [inaudible], Uvat and Bangor all of which were serviced by Halliburton. While we expect to see a slight increase in meterage drilled in Russia for 2010, operators continue to be challenged by lingering financial market issues that could restrain some of the strength of the recovery in Russia. We also saw a 9% sequential revenue increase in Brazil in the third quarter. As you know, we’ve been awarded several new contracts that expand our market position with Petrobras and other participating IOCs. In addition to winning a package for drilling fluid services, we also secured additional contracts for wireline, drill bits and directional drilling all with Petrobras. We also continue to increase our exposure to the growing IOC market in Brazil with a new fluids contract. Deep water Brazil is an important and growing segment. This expansion of our position there will be beneficial to our long term prospects. We expect solid revenue growth in to next year with a ramp up of these new contracts as well as overall higher upstream development activity being forecast for the Brazilian market. Excluding our employee separation costs, international margins for the third quarter were a healthy 22% versus 20% for the second quarter. As we stated last quarter we continue to believe that international margins will be under pressure through 2010. This is based on our knowledge of the lower pricing and the recently competitive tendering activity that took place for work that will begin later this year and in to next year. That pricing would suggest downward risk to current margins which could be partially offset by a more significant rebound in upstream spending. Also, unlike the US market where volume and pricing feel so rapidly that we could not keep our revenues in balance with cost, we have more visibility and time to proactively work on our cost structure and introduce new technologies in the international market and this may help mitigate some of this pricing impact. I’m very pleased with the progress we have made in the last few years in building our international franchise and I believe it will continue to pay dividends as we go forward. Let’s turn to North America. Revenue grew 2% sequentially. While the overall US rig count increased from the prior quarter, the increase was predominately in oil directed rigs. With gas directed rigs declining 6% from the second quarter. In addition, most of the rig activity increase was vertical in nature and operated by the private E&P companies who are not our traditional customers and they are not as service and technology intensive. Despite the lower service intensity and the 6% gas rig activity decline, we saw our first sequential revenue increase in North America since the third quarter 2008. We continue to see our market share increase across most basins as operators direct their work preferentially towards those providers that have broader offerings and better service quality. The Gulf of Mexico had a weak quarter due to the continuing decline in shelf activity with the offshore rig count down 33% sequentially from the second quarter. However, we continue to make progress in expanding our well construction businesses which will benefit from the influx of deep water rigs in the upcoming quarters. We also benefitted somewhat from the seasonal recovery in the Canadian market. However, as you all know the proportionate of the Canadian market to our overall North American business is quite small. We continue to see significant pricing pressure during the third quarter for those product lines that have the most excess capacity in the market. However, improved activity as the quarter progressed help stabilize margins. During the quarter, pricing for our stimulation business stabilized in some basins and reservoirs but continues to decline in areas of robust activity like the Haynesville and Marcellus shales which are particularly competitive. As we have stated in the past, in our view much of the industry’s existing stimulation equipment is unsuitable for the lower depths and pressures of the new shale plays. We believe that the continued use of suboptimal equipment by the oil service industry for these harsh shale environments is unsustainable. This will facilitate the absorption of this oversupplied equipment situation in the market as equipment is much more quickly used up particularly if our competitors are unwilling or unable to spend the appropriate funds to maintain their equipment. So, while we see signs that pricing is stabilizing across all product service lines in certain basins, as I said, in others it is not. But, overall margins are bottoming out, they may be under pressure slightly in the fourth quarter due to the typical season weather factors, the environment stipulations that affect the operations in Iraqis and potential declines during the holidays when customers typically stop spending in an environment like this and send their people home. In addition, in the third quarter we saw customers continuing to drill more wells than they completed. We now believe that there is an inventory of about 1,300 to 1,500 uncompleted wells in North America. Part of this is due to the low gas price and part of this is due to customers not wanting to grow their actual production until they have their 2010 hedges in place. While this will be very positive for us when this completion backlog is worked off in 2010, it clearly created a disconnect between demand for drilling related services versus completion related services in the third quarter. We expect this to continue in to the fourth quarter. This disconnect can be seen in our third quarter results for our US land operations where our drilling related product service lines showed an 8% sequential increase in revenue and some actual margin expansion but our completion related product lines, primarily stimulation showed only a 1% sequential increase in revenue with some related margin contraction. This lower level of completion activity affected the product lines of course with the largest industry overcapacity and we believe this is another contributor that could pressure fourth quarter pricing. All this being said however, we believe that margin expansion in 2010 is possible that it will result in activity increases rather than be pricing led and that further pricing erosion can be mitigated by a realization of our cost savings initiatives. We are also anticipating a structural shift in the US land market as unconventional resources become a more prominent component of the production profile. We expect to benefit from this trend as operators are drilling longer horizontals and increasing their fracture and stimulation treatment to enhance initial production rates. This is why it is so important for us to direct our resources to those areas. We have expanded our facilities this year to support our growth in the Marcellus, Haynesville and Williston basins. We believe these investments and our differentiated technologies will ensure that we will retain our market share gains and accelerate our growth once the market recovers. While the near term look for both North America and international continues to be challenging we have been executing against our strategy of improving our condition in key markets. Internationally our incremental capital spending has been geared disproportionately towards deeper water where we are well positioned. In North America we have seen our market share increase in a number of basins as operators prefer to rely on Halliburton’s broad offerings and service quality for their work. The success of this strategy appears to be supported by the recent oil field market report by Spears & Associates that indicates that we have gained market share in all of our product lines on a worldwide basis and Tim will talk about this in more detail. Uncertainty about the timing and breadth of the recovery remains and various factors will influence the path of growth coming out of this downturn in the many markets we serve however, our strategic imperative has been to continue to identify and increase our exposure to the industry’s highest growth markets. The underlying trend towards well complexity will drive increase service intensity and broad beneficial overtones to our business as we go forward whether it’s in increased reliance on unconventional resources or expansion of the deep water drilling activity worldwide. Let me turn the call over to Mark and he can go in to more detail on our financial results.
Mark A. McCollum : Let me provide you with our third quarter operational highlights and I’ll be comparing our third quarter results sequentially to the second quarter of 2009. Our revenue in the third quarter was $3.6 billion, up 3% from the second quarter. As Dave mentioned, this is the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008 that we have shown a sequential quarterly increase. On a geographic basis, most regions grew sequentially led by our eastern hemisphere regions, each with a 4% increase. International revenue grew 3% versus an average international rig count decline of 1%. North America revenue grew 2% despite the challenging pricing environment. Total operating income for the third quarter of $474 million was essentially flat from the previous quarter as increased operating income in international markets offset continued weakness in North America. In addition, we’ve recognized $28 million in employee separation costs during the third quarter as we continue to execute our cost control program. Our second quarter 2009 results included $17 million in employee separation costs. International margins in the third quarter were 22% excluding employee separation costs up from the second quarter due to strong completion tool sales in the Middle East Asia and pipeline service and vessel activity in Europe Africa CIS. These types of activities tend to be lumpy from a timing standpoint. In fact, our other international region, Latin America registered a margin decline from the second quarter due to lower activity in select markets and the impact of pricing pressures. As Dave indicated, despite the overall strong margin results for Q3 we believe that our international margins are at risk to fall in to the upper teens over the next five quarters driven by lower pricing. The timing and the depth of the margin decline will be dependent on various project start ups which we expect to predominately occur in the first half of 2010. For North America, margins in the third quarter fell from the prior quarter consistent with our guidance at our second quarter earnings call. Average pricing continues to deteriorate in the third quarter but we are now seeing pricing stabilizing for most of our product service lines. Overall, North American margins experienced a gradual improvement throughout the quarter driven by improved activity and cost savings so leading edge margins suggest to us that we are near the bottom. However, as Dave pointed out we still expect that we could see a slight margin decline in the fourth quarter due to the typical seasonal issues in the Rockies and operator’s holiday schedules. Now, I’ll highlight the segment results and note we’ve excluded employee separation costs in the comparisons that follow. Completion and production revenue increased $69 million or 4% mainly due to increased activity in Russia, the North Sea and Angola. Production enhancement revenue grew 6% from the second quarter increased international activity. Overall completion and production operating income was flat as the flow through of increased international revenue was offset by continued pricing declines in North America. Looking at completion and production on a geographic basis, North American revenue increased while operating income declined as higher US land activity was outweighed by price erosion. As Dave mentioned, we’re seeing strong signs that pricing is bottoming across most basins which may lead to the stabilization of margins in the next couple of quarters. In Latin America completion and production revenues slightly declined and operating income fell 14% driven by lower activity across all product lines in Venezuela and Argentina. In addition, higher second quarter deliveries of completion tools in Mexico and Brazil also affected this segment’s results in the third quarter which is typical of this product service line since it often experiences irregular delivery patterns from quarter-to-quarter. In Europe Africa CIS completion and production revenue and operating income increased 10% and 57% respectively due to recovery in Russia and improved vessel and pipeline and processing services activity in the North Sea and West Africa. We expect to see vessel activity decline in the fourth quarter consistent with historical seasonal patterns. In Middle East Asia, completion and production posted sequential increases in revenue and operating income of 6% and 17% respectively with higher production enhancement activity in Southeast Asia and increase completion tool sales in Saudi Arabia, China and India. In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue and operating income increased slightly on sequential growth in North America and Middle East Asia. We continue to see considerable improvement in our Baroid product service line which had operating income growth across all regions. In North America, drilling and evaluations revenue and operating income each increased 3% as our well construction product service lines continued to benefit from the favorable mix towards horizontal drilling notably in the Haynesville and Marcellus shale. Growth in land operations was offset by decline in the Gulf of Mexico from lower shelf activity and deep water rig delays. Looking ahead, we see stronger Gulf of Mexico activity for the division as additional deep water rigs come online. Drilling and evaluations Latin America revenue and operating income remain flat from the prior quarter. Lower revenue in Venezuela was offset by increased drilling in Mexico and wireline and testing jobs in Brazil. During the quarter we commenced our Chicontepec drilling project and are currently working on four rigs. The heavy rain that occurred in the last week of September had a minimal impact on our drilling operations in the field. In the Europe Africa CIS region drilling and evaluation revenue was flat and operating income was up 15% from the prior quarter as a result of the strong flow through of the revenue increases in the Caspian and Russia as well as a better mix of higher margin directional drilling activity in Norway and Angola. Drilling and evaluations Middle East Asia revenue was up 3% but operating income declined 6% due to the mix of projects in Saudi Arabia and project start up costs in Southeast Asia. Now, I’ll address some additional financial items. As a second part of our two pronged strategy of navigating through this downturn, we continue to generate positive cash flow and maintain our strong liquidity position while at the same time investing the necessary capital to improve our overall competitive position. By focusing on the management of our working capital we generated approximately $100 million of positive cash flow for the quarter and have $3.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities at the end of September. Our current net debt to total capitalization ratio has decreased to 11% at the end of the third quarter. We continue to hold $1.2 billion of unused borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facilities and continue to maintain our investment grade debt ratings. We anticipate that corporate expenses will be approximately $50 to $55 million for the fourth quarter. We continue to forecast our 2009 effective income tax rate for the full year of 2009 to be between 31% and 32%. Finally, we’re currently in the process of setting our capital expenditure plan for 2010 and will be providing more specific cap ex guidance in our fourth quarter call. A key part of our capital strategy in 2009 has been to spend within our operating cash flows and at this point that strategy will continue to be our guiding principal for next year. However, if we see positive changes in activity or the industry outlook we’ll make adjustments accordingly. Further, we continually reassess the configuration of our tools and equipment based on our view of the market so for competitive reasons we’ll not be providing further updates on additions and retirements of our equipment.
Timothy J. Probert : Earlier this year we discussed the parallels of this cycle compared to previous cycles. This quarter provides the industry with additional reference points and with that in mind it’s a good time to revisit analogies from past downturns. Based on the familiar mix that we’ve discussed earlier in the call of supply, storage and demand, it’s our view that the North America cycle could be consistent with that of the 2002 recovery. In 2002 gas directed recants rebounded from trough levels and were then range bound for around 33 weeks versus being range bound for around 17 weeks at this point in the 2009 cycle. If we follow this pattern, then drilling activity may remain at restrained levels in to the first half of 2010 before demonstrating a meaningful increase. Complicating factors in the recovery include shut in wells and the impact of the 1,300 to 1,500 wells which have been drilled and not completed as referenced by Dave earlier. The largest concentration of these appears to be in the Barnett. For reference, there are approximately 4,200 gas well completions in the second quarter, down sharply from last year. Accordingly, the inventory of wells is now becoming statistically significant and could represent 7,000 or more frac stages. Internationally the ’97 cycle took about 84 weeks to reach trough and then rebounded sharply. Currently, we’re in the 48th week of decline but expect that this international downturn will be shallower in aptitude and shorter in duration than the previous cycle. In our view, the industry supply issues impacted primarily by accelerating decline curves are more pervasive today than they’ve been in the past. While operators are continuing to constrain incremental upstream spending, they’re taking advantage of lower service costs while keeping activity levels relatively steady. However, as prolonged under investment exacerbates supply concerns, this may lead to a robust rebound in international activity as the global economy recovers. We’ve been working hard to execute our strategy and as Dave pointed out the current Spears oil field market report provides additional data points to support our progress. Halliburton participates in roughly 25% to 30% of all the oil field segments monitored by Spears. According to the latest report, Halliburton is growing share by 5% to 9% across all of our product lines except in directional drilling and testing where they report an approximate 15% in these businesses. We’re especially pleased that our directional drilling business has overtaken our closest competitor and garnered the number two spot. The same holds true for our drill bits product line where we’re now the number three player in that segment.
David J. Lesar : To summarize we’re seeing signs that pricing has bottomed in North America, though as we said margins may decline slightly in the fourth quarter due to the items that we enumerated. Our international market and outlook remains unchanged. Operators are currently not increasing their spending until they see evidence of broad based demand recovery. We believe margin degradation is possible over 2010 based on the competitive tendering we’ve seen although we may be able to mitigate some of this will cost controls and increased volumes from the recently awarded work we’ve gotten. We are successfully expanding our market position in key markets during this down cycle and we believe that by deploying our resources where we think activity will be robust, we will retain the share gains that we’ve experienced and accelerate our growth once the industry rebounds. I think it’d be good to open it up for questions at this point. Christian do you want to lay down the rules?
Christian Garcia : We will entertain questions. Please be remind that we will just have one question and one follow up for each caller.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company International.
Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company International: Dave, you mentioned that you were more confident with respect to the international markets and you provided some commentary along those lines but you also mentioned that you were seeing continued reticence on part of the IOCs with regard to prosecuting spending increases due to a lack of confidence, demand, so forth and so on. How is your increased confidence internationally manifesting itself with respect to your international business?
David J. Lesar : I think Bill in a couple of ways, one if you look at commodity prices have bounced around a little bit in Q3 but it now seems to be settling sort of in the $70 to $80 range. Part of it is just due to a lot of the discussions that I’ve had with our customers in the international market place about their spending plans and the fact that some major projects like the Gorgon project and several of those have now been sanctioned and are going forward. I think as one IOCs sees other IOCs stake big projects forward, then I think that just tends to build on itself. So, I think it’s really been more based on discussions and my confidence level is therefore increased that this is not going to be maybe as hard a downturn as we thought or I thought a quarter or so ago.
Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company International: Secondly, with respect to the follow up, if you could provide just some brief commentary and outlook and insight with regard to two markets, Mexico especially Chicontepec as well as Iraq.
David J. Lesar : Let me handle Iraq first, actually I was recently in Bagdad and there’s clearly a lot of activity, a lot of people are going in and out of there. It certainly is a market that has a lot of reserve base that will support I think a large and diversified oil services industry going forward. I think it’s also going to be a market that really sort of calls for every type of philosophy of service work from an integrated packaging drilling market to traditional services to maybe even some risk taking. I think there’s really going to be some room for all of that in there. That being said, there’s really not a lot going on in there other than people looking at building some infrastructure. We are in the process of staffing up in Iraq, we are moving equipment in but I really don’t see that we will have a significant revenue stream out of there certainly for several years. We will have revenue, we’ll have revenue this year, we’ll have more revenue next year but it’s not really going to be meaningful I don’t think for a couple of years but clearly it is a big prize out there for oil services. I think you see everybody trying to establish a base there and we’re no exception. Clearly, a great future there and one we will participate in, in a big way. In Mexico, I think everybody has sort of been reading the news around Chicontepec, we obviously have some exposure in Chicontepec with some of the projects that we have won. We don’t have the exposure that maybe some of our competitors do. I think that there clearly is a rethink going on within Pemex on the contracting philosophy around Chicontepec. Right now the contract philosophy has been sort of drill the cheapest hole and really don’t worry about maximizing production. I think that concept is being rethought within the upper reaches of Pemex and we think that perhaps they would envision changing that contracting philosophy going forward to make it more of one that increases production versus just drilling the cheapest whole. We are just getting started on our Chicontepec project and it really isn’t providing any meaningful revenue or operating income at this point in time so we continue to watch that market and see whether that philosophy is going to result in a change.
Operator: Your next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co.
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co.: First question on international margins, if I understand your comments correct it sounds like you’re still looking at a 300 to 500 point basis compression but it’s from the third quarter level of around 22% as opposed to let’s say the second quarter level. Is that correct?
David J. Lesar : I think Geoff that if you look at what we said last quarter, we thought it would be 300 to 500 basis points and our margins were lower. Our margins are a bit higher this quarter which is why I think we’ve adjusted our thinking in to the high teens from the mid to high teens so I think generally you would conclude that – let me just reiterate now that you sort of opened the door there. The issue is if you look at the pricing that we’re having to tender to work it would suggest and will result in lower margins going forward. However, because of the length of time we have to prepare for these contracts we also can more easily adjust our cost structure to anticipate that revenue stream and therefore perhaps some of that pricing decline can get mitigated especially the more time you have to get ready. So, I’m not trying to be cute here it’s just that the more time you have to get ready for a project the better you can do to get your cost in line. One of the silver linings I think of this slowdown has been even though a lot of this work has been tendered and we’ve been successful in winning it the delay in implementing these projects has in fact given us more time to work on our supply chain and to work on our infrastructure costs to try and offset some of the margin decline that you had to give up in pricing. That’s really why we believe the pressure is going to be there but the longer we have the less that impact is going to be.
Mark A. McCollum : Just to add some color on that Geoff, I calculate that probably about 50 basis points of the margin improvement in Q3 is due to cost savings.
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co.: As a follow up to kind of the comments you’ve made Dave are pretty broad and would apply across your international business in terms of supply chain and so on but as you look are there markets where you would expect to see perhaps no margin compression or markets where you would expect to see outsized margin compression? And, if you do see differentials would that be more because of mix, differential pricing pressure or really just the timing of projects?
David J. Lesar : I think Geoff I’m not going to be as foolish to say that there’s a market where we won’t have any compression or I guarantee our customers in that area will come straight at the service industry and want some compression of margins. But, there are markets like that but I’m certainly not going to enumerate them. There are markets that have gotten very, very competitive just because of the prizes that are out there, two that would come to mind. The first would be Brazil, we’ve been very successful in winning projects down there but that’s also a very big prize that our competition also sees and I think therefore the pressure on the tendering process has been pretty good. West Africa and Angola would be another where you see big projects, long term projects, lots of dollars involved and those also have tended to get very, very competitive. Then, I would say the markets where activity is less robust but us and our competitors sort of have large embedded infrastructures like the North Sea where there is very little activity going on but a large fixed cost base so anything that comes up for tender in an area like that, and I’m talking about the UK sector of the North Sea, also tends to get very, very competitive in terms of pricing.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brad Handler – Credit Suisse.
Brad Handler – Credit Suisse: I guess the first question is the recontracting cycle often as you head towards the end of the year you end up recontracting with your clients, has the current market changed that? Did you do so much recontracting in the first half of the year and fixing your pricing basin out for a while that we’re not going to see or hear a lot about the recontracting now as we turn towards the end of the year?
David J. Lesar : I think yes, you will not hear much about it as we get to the end of the year mainly because that philosophy has essentially been tossed out the door by our customer base because of the over capacity, especially in the pressure pumping side of the business I wouldn’t quite say it is a job by job but certainly it’s maybe a 30 well program of 50 well program at a time and then the customer tends to go out and retender it or rebid it or in many cases with us renegotiate it. It doesn’t go out for tender but they try to renegotiate sort of based on the current market. So the process that was in place over the last several years when things were a lot busier for the service industry was to try and tie up a service company for a year, negotiate a price and then sort of sit back and say, “Great now I have the resources.” With the excess capacity that’s available today customers fee no compunction about tearing up an agreement and basically taking it back out for tender. I don’t really see that that is going to change until some of this overhang of equipment goes out of the market.
Brad Handler – Credit Suisse: I guess another Q4 type of question, as it relates to what I’ll call the normal seasonal uptick in things like export sales and your wireline business and the tools business, often I assume you have some visibility about that. Where do you see that as it relates to this Q4 and what does that say about what the customers are willing to commit to regarding programs for the following year?
David J. Lesar : I would say that’s a thing that has changed also a bit. We have pretty good visibility in terms of backlog for traditional sales and we’re not seeing the buildup in backlog that we typically would this time of year. I think part of it is just our customers are also paying a great deal more attention to their inventory supplies, their supply chain. As our supply chain has gotten more efficient at being able to produce and ship stuff on a real time basis, our customers have started to draw down their own inventory stocking expectations. Then of course, I think you’ve got the whole element of the projects that have slowed down and now knowing when they’re going to start up. So, I don’t think you’re going to see, and that’s part of what we’re trying to broadcast here, I don’t think you’re going to see the spike up of sales that we typically see in Q4, at least our order books wouldn’t support that at this point in time. That doesn’t really concern me greatly because as I said I think part of it is just more a sufficient supply chain all the way through the industry but certainly some of it is a reluctance on the part of our customers to spend what capital they have here the balance of the year. I would hope that we would see that backlog pop up as we get in to next year but we’ll just have to wait and see.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alan Laws – BMO Capital Markets.
Alan Laws – BMO Capital Markets: I have a couple of questions, the first one being on you seem to have gotten a lot of fluid contracts recently. Can you tell us what’s kind of changed or changing at Baroid? Is this just like a cluster or is your competitive position changed at all?
Timothy J. Probert : Alan, we’ve had as significant focus on Baroid over the last couple of years. Jeff Miller who leads that product line has been really very focused on developing a strategy to essentially rebuild and strengthen the franchise. It’s one which has been particular successful so I wouldn’t characterize this as sort of a flurry of activity around a sort of concentration of particular bids, it’s really more sort of a fundamental structural change in the way in which we do business and as a result of that we’re obviously looking for sustainability in terms of performance of Baroid.
Alan Laws – BMO Capital Markets: Is there a mix improvement as well and more deep water?
Timothy J. Probert : Very much so. I think that we’ve clearly been significantly more successful in deep water and that’s all about gaining confidence of our customers since deep water is something which they take very, very seriously in terms of service selection. So, Baroid’s success rate in deep water is clearly is a function of the confidence that they’ve built with major customers around the world.
Alan Laws – BMO Capital Markets: I have another question, more of a high level issues question, can you talk a little bit about the controversy this sector faces in respective to frac fluids and sort of the breadth wing that we have on the environmental side?
Timothy J. Probert : I think that clearly there has been a great deal of discussion around sort of the whole legislative process and not to sort of belabor the point I think that clearly studies that have taken place through the years have really detected no evidence that fracturing has any impact to drinking water sources which has been the primary focus of this discussion since its inception 60 years or so ago. So, we’re continuing to work and investigate opportunities within our technology to minimize exposure and as an example of that, at the SPE just last week in fact, we introduced something we call a chemical scoring index which provides a benchmark metric on sort of the relative environmental performance of our suite of fluids and enables our customers to really make a selection of treatments based on the balance between reservoir performance and environmental performance. We certainly anticipate this becoming an industry benchmark which we hope will drive sort of an increased awareness in environmental issues and stewardship and at the same time provide us with an opportunity to continue to advance the science around improving our customer’s performance of their wells.
Alan Laws – BMO Capital Markets: Just sort of more of an educational issue for customers and politicians?
Timothy J. Probert : Yes, I think it will give our customers an opportunity to select the appropriate fluid that gives them the balance between environmental sensitivity and also reservoir performance.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Tillery – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.
Jeff Tillery – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.: With regards to Russia, and you guys showed a really big sequential increase in that market. One of the industry kind of recount services showed a fairly significant drop off in September of activity. Is that something that you guys saw in the field or is Russia just kind of pushing forward ahead?
Timothy J. Probert : We’ve been very pleased with our performance in Russia. I think when we take a look at Russia overall I mean clearly 80% to 85% of the production today is coming out of Western Siberia which is a very, very mature province. As Russia looks to sort of try and maintain its leadership position if you’d like in terms of global production it’s going to force a great deal of incremental activity in to Eastern Siberia and other locations all of which are significantly more service intensive locations for companies like Halliburton. All-in-all we’re very positive on the outlook though of course as Dave pointed out in his commentary there are sort of some financial overtones which still have to be resolved in order to perhaps allow Russia to achieve its full potential. But, we don’t think that the month-to-month data collection is probably a little bit iffy. We certainly didn’t see any significant change which would alter the picture which we outlined on the call here.
Jeff Tillery – Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.: Then an unrelated follow up question, just regarding some of the contracts that were negotiated earlier this year internationally I believe had some oil price escalation clauses in them. Presumably those oil prices are at a point where those clauses could potentially kick in. Could you just comment on how Halliburton is treating those and if you’re trying to push for higher pricing or increased scope on those contracts?
Timothy J. Probert : Yes, those escalators basically include in a number of cases oil price triggers for a period of time so it is necessary for those oil prices to be sustained above a certain level for a period of time. Clearly that gives us the right to have a discussion with our customers and we’re certainly having discussion with a number of our customers but we’re also in a very competitive environment Jeff so we’re reserving that right but the timing of improvement in pricing relative to those triggers is yet to be seen.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley: First of all back on the fluids situation again, would you say that you are clearly gaining market share given the announcements in your press release but are you gaining market share by replacing incumbent operators or are you gaining market share by winning new rigs that are coming in to the market?
Timothy J. Probert : I think the answer to that is really both and the deep water experience has been a function of both and that’s obviously one which everyone pays a great deal of attention to. I guess the short answer is both the combination of new rigs and also replacing incumbents.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley: A little bit more specific, is it predominately – I mean Brazil is clearly replacement but on the other rigs are they new rigs, is it evenly balanced or is it predominately one of them?
Timothy J. Probert : I can’t really sort of give you a detailed breakdown of that Ole but it’s a combination of both of those elements. I think to sort of elaborate a little bit further, certainly the data would suggest that we have indeed been gaining market share and we’re obviously very proud of that.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley: On the market outlook Tim, you gave a pretty robust outlook while the reference of previous cycles I don’t think we’ve ever had a cycle where $77 dollar oil is a trough. But, you seem pretty optimistic when you said a vigorous international recovery yet Mark you continue talking about your 300 to 500 basis point negative margins so there seems to be a little bit of a dichotomy between the way the two of you are describing the outlook. Could you clarify if you defer at all?
David J. Lesar : I think it’s important to understand that we have a pretty robust view of the international markets. We’ve seen the contracts that have been tendered so we know that there is a good revenue stream that is going to come off of those contracts but they are not going to be at the margins we saw at the peak in the last cycle because of the longer term nature of the international contracting market. Therefore, you could see the revenues kick up but they’re not going to bring with it initially the incremental margins that we would have seen two, three, four quarters ago because it will take us time as I said, to make sure our costs are in line, our supply chain is in line and then we can bring appropriate new technology in to those contracts and upsell from that opportunity. So, I really would think of it as sort of a dichotomy in the view. Clearly, we see a kick up on the revenue side but the margin side I think is going to lag and that’s what we’re trying to sensitize our investor base to is that we’re not going to have the kinds of incrementals you saw 12 or 18 months ago. It’s going to take some time to work our way back to those incrementals but as activity does increase then the margins will start to come up.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley: So we’re led by a strong revenue growth and then margins follow later?
David J. Lesar : Exactly. That’s what we’re trying to say.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup.
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup: I wanted to ask you about the market share gains in North America that you referenced. I know you’ve had an initiative to try and bundle or package your products. A typical package might be bits, motors and mud. I wonder if that is having some success or if you can give us an update on that strategy?
David J. Lesar : I think it is having a success. What we’d like to do is package bits, motors, muds, frac and completions but as Tim has said and I have said we’ve been very successful at doing the bits, muds and motor piece but because of the really pretty amazing number of wells that are being drilled but not completed right now you aren’t able to sort of bring the full suite of services to bear. But, there clearly has been a push on our part to do that and in my view we’ve been very successful at it. When we get back to a more normal routine of basically being able to do what is essentially a turnkey well from the drilling all the way through completions, I think that strategy will pay even more but it certainly is paying even in this marketplace.
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup: Just following up on your comments about the pressure pumping equipment supply relative to demand and I think you’ve cited that the wear and tear on pumping units have increased and I think we’ve seen examples in the Haynesville wells which are notorious pump eaters and I think you’ve experienced that as well as others. Predominately, where is the excess use and wear and tear coming from that is leading to perhaps a greater rate of decline in the pressure pumping unit supply?
Timothy J. Probert : Generally Robin I would say that the combination of sort of high pressures, high temperatures and long, long stages are really driving the sort of wear and tear equation. As we outlined before, and I think as many others have outlined in the industry, we’re certainly not alone in that factor that this is a source of potential using up of equipment if you like and restricting the amount of capacity that is ultimately going to be available. It really benefits those and certainly rewards those that have strong maintenance program and those that continue to invest in making sure that their technology is up to date to service these wells. In some respects it’s not a lot different with drilling equipment either. So, I think it’s just a general source of tougher more complex wells which require more service intensity than we have historically seen.
Mark A. McCollum : We’re seeing this particularly in the Haynesville. That’s an area where this situation is most acute and as we see our customers they might go and use equipment that is under power for it and they’ll walk away from it because of poor service quality and the inability to meet their requirements on getting those jobs done.
Operator: Your last question comes from Michael Urban – Deutsche Bank North America.
Michael Urban – Deutsche Bank North America: I wanted to talk about the margin dynamic you talked about a little bit in the US and some of the higher end shale plays were potentially coming under some pressure there. Presumably that is because you’re coming from a higher level there, the rest of the US has been pretty depressed for a while and I believe margins have held up a little better in that space and now you’re seeing competition come in. Is that reasonable?
David J. Lesar : I think it is two things, one is that as we’ve successfully our market share strategy a lot of our competitors, especially the smaller competitors have really concentrated their efforts in the two big shale plays that are robust today, the Haynesville and the Marcellus. I think if you look at where there is the most over capacity in the industry and pressure pumping today, it clearly is in those two basins. Then, you couple that with the very difficult frac conditions that Tim just talked about so you are having to bid fairly cheap to get work but then the work you are doing is very tough and consumes a lot of profit, it consumes a lot of pumping time, you have to take a lot of equipment to location so therefore you don’t get the efficiency that we typically would have in some of the other more established basins around the US. It’s pretty clear that as time went on in the other basins in the US we had figured out a way to sort of most efficiently frac wells. The level of activity to date in the Haynesville hasn’t allowed us to be able to get that model precisely where we want it. We certainly are making progress in that area but I think if you couple a relatively inefficient way of fracing right now with a way over capacity of competitors that are in those markets it really makes for a very, very fierce competitive situation. We’re well suited to fight in a market place like that and we very much are.
Michael Urban – Deutsche Bank North America: I think you basically just answered this but, going forward as you are able to drive those efficiencies as you have in the past, as the competitors presumably aren’t able to perform as well as you think you are or will be, that’s still going to be a very good market for you rather than a market for your customers?
David J. Lesar : I think that it will be a good market for both of us.
Christian Garcia : Before we close out our call we would like to announce that our fourth quarter 2009 earnings call will be held on January 25, 2010 at 9 am Eastern. Please mark your calendars and thank you for participating in today’s call.

Operator: (Operator Instructions) Welcome to your Halliburton Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. At this time I would like to turn the program over to Mr. Christian Garcia, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Christian Garcia: Welcome to the Halliburton Second Quarter 2009 Conference Call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the second quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO, Mark McCollum, CFO and Tim Probert, President, Drilling and Evaluation Division and Corporate Development. In today's call Dave will provide opening remarks, Mark will discuss our overall financial performance and liquidity position, and Tim will provide comments on our operations and business outlook. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. Before turning the call over to Dave I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Note that we will be using the term international to refer to our operations outside the US and Canada and we will refer to the combination of US and Canada as North America. Our comments include non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the press release announcing the second quarter results. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave Lesar.
Dave Lesar: Here’s a summary of our overall results for the second quarter. Total revenue of $3.5 billion represented a decline of 11% from the first quarter of 2009 driven by a sequential reduction in North America revenue of about 25%. Our International revenues remain flat sequentially. The downturn in international markets however has not been as pronounced as I first believed due to the strengthening commodity prices, deflationary cost environment, and stabilizing financial markets which are improving our customers overall project economics. International margins were 20% despite the pricing pressures we were seeing from our customers.  We are executing our strategy of maintaining our investment in technology and infrastructure while taking steps to control our costs and improve our financial flexibility. There are strong indications that we are executing this strategy effectively. Our revenue per rig is growing sequentially. We are continuing to expand our international footprint in select markets evidenced by the sizeable number of recent customer awards. We continue to commercialize new technologies for growing markets such as the deepwater.  We are managing our business within our cash flow even as we continue to invest heavily in our key product service lines such as wireline, drilling and stimulation. We continue to implement cost cutting measures to address this challenging environment. Let me turn to discuss our International business and current prospects. While the International rig count declined 4% our revenues and operating income were flat sequentially. The depth of decline in the international markets may not be as severe as past cycles. We believe it will mirror it in terms of its duration. In the second quarter we also saw operators maintaining their focus on lowering project costs. However, with the increase in oil prices and recent contract wins I’m actually feeling better about the international markets now then I did at the end of Q1. In the second quarter international revenue represented 64% of our total business and activity in select markets appears to be stabilizing. In Russia we saw a 7% sequential increase in revenues associated with the markets seasonal improvement. Activity in Russia increased 27% sequentially due to increased activity by independent operators. We saw sequential double digit growth in Mexico, Norway, and China, while Brazil and parts of Southeast Asia also exhibited positive sequential increases. We anticipate that these countries will continue to provide growth for us in the second half of the year and into 2010. International tender activity increased in the second quarter and we won a number of sizeable contract awards including the following: bay-wide has been awarded over $1 billion in new contracts globally including $700 million for deepwater projects in Brazil, Indonesia, and Angola and other countries, and $300 million in revenue per shelf and land related work. We also won a two year contract for our cementing and completions and drilling fluid services for StatoilHydro which we estimate will be valued at approximately $450 million. A contract award in Algeria for the provision of integrated project management for a number of delineation wells initially with a potential to expand to 120 wells for full field development. We have added to our integrated project management backlog with the addition of over 150 wells for the next three years in Latin America. We won a five year contract for more than $100 million in the Middle East for directional drilling and LWD services. In addition, we won additional wireline work in Brazil and a new wireline contract in Iraq which is testament to the strength of our formation evaluation technologies. In addition, we are augmenting our capability in the Caspian region in anticipation of a significant five year award for multiple services with the potential value of $200 million per year. The deepwater markets also continue to be resilient. We have a leading position in the deepwater market in a number of our product lines. We are the leader in deepwater completions and continue to invest in next generation technology for these challenging projects. We are also closely monitoring the awards of cementing skid placements for deepwater rigs that are coming into the market. Our year to date win rate is over 60% which is above our current market leading share position. These awards and contract wins are strong evidence of the successful execution of our international strategy. Now turning to North America. A sequential decline in the average rig count in North America of 39% led to more severe margin compression in the industry then we previously anticipated. This 39% decline comes on top of a 28% sequential decline in the first quarter. Working natural gas storage continues to be ahead of its normal seasonal patterns which suggest that despite reduced drilling activity the supply curtailment in gas production has not yet caught up with lower demands.  Further, the expectation that gas storage may potentially reach record levels by the end of the injection period indicates that any recovery in gas drilling is likely to be relatively modest for the remainder of 2009. Our North America revenue declined 25% while our revenue per rig continued to grow this quarter and we experienced market share gains and by leveraging the shift toward more service intensive resources such as unconventional place. The number of rigs operating in the major unconventional plays has climbed and now represents over 40% of total rigs in the US. Price erosion of course continued in the second quarter and we believe pricing will remain fluid until activity stabilizes. Pricing declines, however, appear to be decelerating. We still anticipate that we will see some margin compression in the third quarter but it will be driven more from lower activity then continued pricing erosion. We have said that in the past that this environment favors companies that can integrate broad based offerings. We’ve made great strides in expanding our overall market position by leveraging the full extent of our technology and solutions portfolio. As an example, earlier this year we won a five year $1.5 billion contract with an IOC for its work throughout North America. The contract covers services that range from well construction to completion and production and effectively doubles our share of this customer spend both for its land and deepwater operations. We’ve also picked up the work of a number of our customers we had not been able to serve previously due to equipment shortages. Our ability to manage the delivery of integrated packaged services has been a key differentiator and provides customers with better project execution and lower overall cost.  The execution of our strategy in addressing this environment remains the same. We are employing a two pronged approach. First we are looking through this cycle to ensure that we will accelerate our growth when the industry recovers. We continue to invest in key technologies, build capital equipment and pursue strategic acquisitions. We are using the strength of our balance sheet to differentiate ourselves and expand our market position in key markets. The second part of our approach is managing through the downturn, drawing upon our managements experience in navigating through the past cycles. We are aggressively lowering our input costs, eliminating discretionary spending and managing our business within our cash flows and of course protecting our strong credit rating. I don’t believe anyone on the call today can accurately predict when commodity prices will rebound and rig counts will recover in the US or the international markets and neither can I. What I do believe is that whatever scenario you think may happen we have the products, technology and experience to outperform in that market. We have demonstrated this to you for the past several years. Whatever the level of industry activity we will get more than our pro-rata share of it. I’d like Mark now to cover more details on the financial statements.
Mark McCollum: Let me provide you with our second quarter operational highlights. I’ll be comparing our second quarter results sequentially to the first quarter of 2009. Our revenue in the second quarter was $3.5 billion down 11% from the first quarter. Except for completion tools and software and asset solutions all product service lines registered declines from the previous quarter primarily resulting from continued lower activity and pricing pressures in North America. On a geographic basis international revenue was flat versus an average rig count drop of 4%. North America experienced a 25% sequential revenue decline against a backdrop of a 39% reduction in the average North America rig count. Over the past quarter we’ve discussed the possibility of additional significant margin compression for North America in the second quarter based on the continued steep decline in the rig count. We experienced a 700 basis point decline in our North America margins. This decline reflects a gradual margin deterioration throughout the quarter as the rig count continued to fall. Going forward, as Dave pointed out; visibility for North America continues to be poor given the record working gas storage levels by the end of the third quarter may delay the recovery of natural gas activity. We expect that margin compression may continue to occur in the third quarter but not to the extent seen in the first two quarters of the year. Pricing declines are moderating but margin degradation can also result from lower average activity in the third quarter. International margins in the second quarter were 20%. We’ve been successful in partially offsetting the pricing pressures we discussed in our first quarter call by cost reduction efforts and by leveraging fixed costs in select growth markets. Margin pressures will continue to weight on our international business going forward, however. While we believe this will be partially mitigated by our continued cost focus and improved volumes we currently anticipate that a 300 to 500 basis point margin decline could gradually occur for our international business over the remainder of 2009 and throughout 2010. Overall operating income decreased 23% from the first quarter of 2009 resulting from lower activity and pricing erosion in North America. In addition, the company recognized $17 million for employee termination costs during the second quarter. Our first quarter 2009 results included $28 million in employee termination costs. Now I’ll highlight the segment results. Note that we have not included employee termination costs in the comparisons that follow. Completion and production revenue decreased $276 million or 14% from the first quarter while operating income decreased 33%. The decline in revenue was driven primarily by lower production enhancement and cementing results in North America. Looking at completion and production on a geographic basis North America revenue decreased 26% and operating income declined by 69% due to activity declines and price erosion. In Latin America completion and production revenue declined slightly and operating income was essentially flat driven by lower activity in Venezuela, Columbia and Argentina, partially offset by strong completions activity in Mexico and Brazil. In Europe, Africa, CIS, completion and production revenue increased 3% but operating income declined 10% as higher activity in Norway, Russia and the Caspian was more than offset by higher cost and activity declines in Nigeria, the UK and Algeria. In Middle East/Asia, completion and production posted a sequential decrease in revenue of 3% while operating income was up by 5% due to the better mix of completion tool sales and significantly higher activity in Australia/Asia and the Northern Gulf. In our drilling and evaluation division revenue decreased $137 million or 7% and operating income declined by 7% as well with unfavorable results in North America, partially offset by strong sequential growth in the Middle East/Asia region. In North America drilling and evaluation revenue declined 24% and operating income decreased 56%. All product service lines except for software and asset solutions decline sequentially. The wireline product service line continues to see the greatest level of margin pressure. Our well construction product service lines continue to benefit from the favorable mix toward horizontal drilling, notably in the Hainesville and Marcellus Shales. The proportion of horizontal directed drilling continues to increase and currently represents 43% of total rig count. Drilling and evaluations Latin America revenue declined 2% and income was essentially flat. Like completion and production we saw higher activity in Mexico but it wasn’t sufficient offset sequential reductions we experienced in Venezuela, Columbia and Argentina. In the Europe, Africa, CIS region drilling and evaluation revenue and operating income were down 2% and 5% respectively as higher activity in Norway and some direct sales to Nigeria partially offset sequential declines in Algeria and Angola. Drilling and evaluation revenue and operating income in the Middle East/Asia were up 7% and 23% respectively. Higher direct sales and increased activity in Asia offset weakness in the Middle East. We have finalized the [grace] project in Saudi Arabia and are now in discussions with our customer to direct equipment and resources toward tight gas opportunities in that market. We expect that these opportunities will offset some of the impact of the conclusion of the [grace] project in the second half of the year. Now I’ll address some additional financial items. We generated positive cash flow of approximately $120 million for the second quarter. As of June 30 we have $3.1 billion of cash and investments in marketable securities compared to $3 billion at the end of the first quarter. We have $1.2 billion of unused borrowing capacity in our revolving credit facility and continue to maintain our A, A2 credit ratings. We anticipate that corporate expenses will be approximately $50 to $55 million per quarter for the rest of the year. We are currently forecasting that our 2009 effective income tax rate for the full year will be approximately 32%. We are holding to our previous full year 2009 capital expenditures forecast of $1.8 billion and finally, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $225 to $230 million per quarter or about $900 million in total during 2009.
Tim Probert: North American rig declines and specifically a decline in the US rig count by 55% from it peak have led to a significant oversupply of all types of equipment in the market. Resizing our fleet for 2010 is a pressing issue and we’ve an active program to address absorption of this capacity through a retirement program we expect to retire and remove from service approximately 10% to 15% of our pumping and wireline fleets this year depending on the product line. Transfer to international growth areas which in some product lines will exceed 12% of our North American fleet, increased equipment requirement of around 10% to 15% on stimulation equipment in Shale blaze as a result of the impact of accelerated maintenance on equipment in these more complex plays. Currently there are 244 oil directed rigs in the US reflecting a 36% increase from the trough in May this year. We’re consequently seeing improved outlooks for the Bakken and Permium basin in the second half. Gas directed rigs have declined almost 60% from peak and over 30% sequentially for the quarter. Gas rigs continue to weaken and now represent only 70% of the total activity in the US down from 80% at peak. Internationally while sentiments improved from our first quarter call, the rig count has continued to decline and is now down 13% from it peak. Significantly high value offshore rigs have declined 16% from their peak last year and 4% sequentially. David and Mark have discussed the likely margin compression as the result of these activity changes and I’d like to provide a bit more color on their efforts to mitigate this. As we discussed in our first quarter call, we sought to lower input costs by aggressively pursuing price concession from our supply chain. We’ve identified 17 major categories that represent about 60% of all our supply spend.  Based on these discussions so far we’ve secured discounts that range from high single digits to mid to 30% for an annualized savings about around about $350 million. Of this amount three quarters related to our materials that support our operations and the rest items procured capital equipment. The recognition of these savings into our financial statements is dependent on a variety of factors such as our inventory turn rates so realized savings in the first half have been modest. We’ve continued our commitment to develop next generation technology focused on growth markets and extracting value from long term contracts. The deepwater we recently commercialized the enhanced single trip multi-zone completion system. This system allow several intervals within a well to be isolated and treated with a high rate frat during a single trip of the work string providing major time savings for deepwater completions, a prerequisite for improving cost efficiency of deepwater projects. Importantly it’s also the only single trip multi-zone system that can also incorporate smart well technology. This technology has been in purchase, for example, for the development of the Somalia project in the tertiary in the Gulf of Mexico. High temperature and high pressure applications continue to expand acquiring fluid samples in these elevated conditions can be crucial to a wells economic success. Halliburton’s new hostile sequential formation tester was successfully used this quarter for an IOC in North Africa at temperatures above 420 degrees Fahrenheit. Halliburton continues to focus on drilling optimization. [XL Rema] technology was recently utilized to open two hull sections on a record extended reach application in Norway. Those sections were drilled in a single run facilitating this record drilling performance. We’ve talked previously about our focus on delivering package services which allows us to create incremental value by integrating our suite of products and services. Last year we estimated that about 30% of our revenue was on contracts for multiple product service lines some of which may have been coordinated by Halliburton’s project management experts. In contrast to well publicized IPM projects in the past year almost half the contract value of new business we won involves multiple product service lines, suggesting that the market is increasingly favoring broader integrated drilling completion and production portfolios. Adoption is growing internationally for example in Algeria where we are now the leading provider of package services projects. IHS seer reported that the index for upstream capital cost dropped by 9% from the third quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of this year, its first decline in eight years. As future efforts by operators migrate from focusing on individual supply costs towards reducing total project execution costs we anticipate that package services efficiency models will expand favoring those companies that can provide reservoir solutions within hands deficiency.
Dave Lesar: Just to quickly summarize. Visibility to our prospects in North America continues to be poor. The continued weakness and demand and the likelihood that working gas storage will reach record levels makes in unlikely that we’ll see any recovery during the remainder of this year. Our international outlook is improving but there is some uncertainty and it remains. We are seeing some projects move forward and we’ll mitigate some of the margin pressures we’re going to see through additional cost rationalization efforts. We are successfully executing our strategy of increase in our market position by leveraging broad based integrated offerings in assisting our customers with their most complex reservoirs and in the second quarter as I said we won a number of sizeable contracts. We’re executing our two pronged approach of retaining our key investments in technology and capital even during this downturn so we can accelerate growth when the recovery does occur while at the same time taking prudent steps to manage our way through this downturn. We believe that this approach will lead to long term value for our shareholders. Let’s go ahead and open it up for questions now.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup: I wanted to ask you about the forecast that you’ve made of international margins declining by 300 to 500 basis points over the balance of this year and in 2010. I assume that’s from the current level of 20% in the second quarter. Are you anticipating revenue declines or pricing pressures principally contributing to the margin decline or other factors?
Dave Lesar: I think it’s primarily is just going to be pricing pressures. As you know, a number of our IOC customers and some NOC customers came to the entire services industry and asked for discounts earlier this year. I think it’s going to take some time for those price concessions to roll through. Also, about 20% of our available work is re-tendered every year and of course what’s being re-tendered today is being quoted at lower pricing then exists out there.  The discussion was really to give you an order of magnitude about what we think could happen if the environment continues as it is. If commodity prices come up a little bit, if oil prices firm up we may see some additional rigs come into the market, we may see some projects move forward and some of that downward pressure may get mitigated a bit. We wanted to give you some sense of what we saw might happen over the next six quarters.
Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup: My follow up question then is on North America and the lower average activity in the third quarter of ’09 that you’re anticipating. Are there further benefits from your cost reduction program in the third quarter that were not realized in the second that might offset that lower average activity and give you possibly a slightly better margin or flattish margin with the second quarter.
Tim Probert: As we were discussing on the call we have some significant savings that are coming from our supply chain and obviously because of the way inventory turns were that we really haven’t seen much appear in the first half of the year. Yes, there will be some benefits that will show in the second half. I think though that overall in North America we have been on a bit of an unforeseen rollercoaster here. I think we’re certainly cautious with respect to Q3 in terms of the overall outcomes. Gas driven rigs have continued to decline through to this current week in fact.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company
Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company: Continuing with the road map for non-North American margins where do you expect to see the greatest pricing and margin duress and where do you expect to see the most resilient performance?
Dave Lesar: You’re saying with respect to North America?
Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company: No, non-North American margins, and back to your prophecy of down 300 to 500 basis points I’m just curious as to what is misbehaving the most or expectations of the greatest margin erosion and expectations of the greatest margin support.
Dave Lesar: If you look around the world I wouldn’t say that there is one particular area I could point to that is worse than the other or one that’s better than the other. I think that if you look at the IOCs they basically have come to the service industry across the board. I think that that’s going to apply to just about anywhere around the world from a national oil company standpoint obviously the pressure will be in the particular country that they represent. I would say sort of directionally I think the hardest pressure on pricing will come in the North Sea area and probably the least will come in the South America markets but that would sort of be just directionally. I wouldn’t say one was much greater than the other.
Bill Herbert – Simmons & Company: With regard to North America recognizing that everybody’s crystal ball is okay at this stage. Referring back to the commentary that you expect the rate of change in terms of lower to be more benign then what it has been in the first two quarter of this year. Along those lines, detrimentals doing forward for North America are the pretty much going to be in line with what we witnessed in the second quarter?
Mark McCollum: Clearly in the second quarter as the rig count fell the margins on a sequential monthly basis fell each month so there is still some risk that as we go into the third quarter, fourth quarter that margins will be lower. It’s not going to be to the same extent that we saw. As we view the market we sort of see pricing stabilizing somewhat there activity seems to be stabilizing a little bit out there and we just don’t think that as we’ll hear from our competitors over the next week or so we’ll probably feel like that we’re probably close to the bottom in terms of pricing degradation. It’s really going to be more activity dependent as well as the achievement of some of the cost benefits that Tim articulated.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Tillery – Tudor Pickering Holt
Jeff Tillery – Tudor Pickering Holt: I wondered if you could address the margin performance in the Middle East, Asia region this quarter. With [grace] wrapping up was that any sort of benefit to margins in the quarter and should we expect that to normalize downward a little bit going forward?
Dave Lesar: That’s an easy answer, in fact I suspect that with [grace] ramping down we actually had a little downward pressure on margins with respect to that project because we had a lot of equipment on that project focused on getting that thing done and we’re actually now in the process of trying to reorient it and put those pieces of equipment on to work on other contracts. So I would say actually the opposite probably was true as we probably had margin pressure with respect to those assets.
Mark McCollum: From a margin perspective the benefit in that region actually came from Asia. We did have some direct sales but we also saw some activities peak up. Activity in Australia was up about 27% and we also saw benefits in Thailand, Brunei and some other areas where strong completion sales and some other things benefited our results.
Jeff Tillery – Tudor Pickering Holt: As you walk through the retirement order magnitude of equipment retirement we could see in your pumping business in North America are those gross numbers and is their capacity being added if someone offsets that. Additionally so that would indicate more around a 25% decline in capacity in your business is that indicative of how you’re sizing the overall North America business going forward so it kind of for a 25% reduction versus where we were past cycle.
Tim Probert: It’s very dependent on product line by product line basis. We’ve obviously just outlined the steps that we’re taking to address retirements and also the transfers etc. Clearly we have a capital spend of $1.8 billion which you’re well aware of and that spend continues to address a number of needed activities. Some of those will be in North America; some of those will be international. No, I’m not dealing with a net number there those are gross numbers.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets: I’m going to follow up just one more time on the North American margin degradation you guys were kind enough to give us a 300 to 500 basis point target internationally over the next six quarters or so. You talked about North America being less then what we saw in the first half. Are we thinking the same sort of 300 to 500 basis point decrement maybe something less than that can you just give us some generic range to work from?
Dave Lesar: No we really can’t give you a range. It’s not going to be 300 to 500 basis points. I think that as we indicated the margins in June were the lowest margins in the quarter in North America and so it’s going to be very activity dependent. As long as activity is not stable I think that there is risk to the down side on margins but its just not going to be the same extent that we saw. That’s about the best guidance we can give you at this point.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets: With all the pain being endured in North America by a lot of small private players they still haven’t seen any mass exodus of competition or mass M&A. Could you give us an update on what your thoughts are with respect to the consolidation of the North American market as we go into the second half of the year?
Tim Probert: I think it’s certainly likely, there is certainly a fair amount of chatter out there with respect this potential and I think that it’s likely that we might see some activity. You’re right; there has been nothing of significance this point.
Dave Lesar: Let me just add one other piece of commentary to that. I think that as some of the smaller competitors, especially those that are primarily focused on pressure pumping have moved their assets where they typically have moved them is into the more robust areas which is the shale plays. I think its important to remember that the shale plays are very, very tough on equipment and I think that what some of these other pumping companies are finding out is that they’re grinding their equipment up and they’re using it up much faster on the shale plays then maybe they had anticipated. I actually suspect that a lot of equipment will come out of the market not through retirements but by just getting used up because they’re focused on these shale plays and they’ll naturally have to come out of the market. At that point I doubt that some of these smaller pumping companies will be able to replace that equipment. I think that will in fact accelerate the retirement of horsepower out of the North America market.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley: I wonder whether we could just follow up a little bit on that latest point. You highlight 10% to 15% retirement scrapping of your own pressure pumping all the wireline equipment, 12% North American fleet migration to international markets. Could you give us some sort of sense of the timeline that this is playing out over?
Tim Probert: This is underway at the moment. We have already moved during the course of the second quarter some equipment to some international markets. We already have started the process of scrapping individual items of the fleet. It’s a process that’s underway and we’ll be moving forward with it aggressively. We think it’s very important for us to size appropriate for the balance of this year and 2010 and to ensure that we have the right profile going forward. You’ll see us get that largely completed by the end of the year.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley: This is sort of a second half, second, third quarter event is that the way to read it?
Tim Probert: Yes I think that’s very fair. We’ve done a fair amount of it already and we’ll get most of the rest of it done during the course of Q3.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley: Couple that with what you highlighted on shale being tough on equipment, grinding up requiring spare parts maybe for people that don’t have the cash to facilitate it. What’s your sense on overall capacity, clearly we have too much now, and it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure that out. It seems like its sort of shrinking maybe faster than people think. Could you give us some kind of road map on how you think the whole capacity is developing?
Tim Probert: Clearly there’s a significant amount of excess capacity and we would expect the major players to do what is the appropriate thing to address their fleet sizes so that will certainly have a significant impact. The point that Dave made with respect to the shale plays is a very important one. Just for our fleet alone we recon that we need about 10% to 15% incremental equipment to really manage effectively in shale plays and that’s obviously a reflection of the uptime which you have on any particular spread to enable it to perform at optimum performance.  That’s obviously not going to be very different from other providers also. I think those that don’t maintain their fleet well that might well indeed be a much larger number. I think that you could be right there directionally at least that we might see over the course of the next couple of quarters a little more capacity come out then may have been originally realized.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brad Handler – Credit Suisse
Brad Handler – Credit Suisse: Could you please give us a little color on some of the incremental work that you’ve provided in the beginning of the call? You mentioned an IPM project with 150 wells in Latin America. At you at liberty to share where that’s coming from and give us some sense of the opportunity there?
Tim Probert: I think as we’ve said on a couple of our calls we continue to like the potential activity in Latin America and there continues to be some good upside there. Really don’t think we’re going to get into the specifics of where those wells are.
Brad Handler – Credit Suisse: Turning to the StatoilHydro extension, so the contract value seems to represent sort of more than 2x of your original value. Can you share a little bit of that growth for us is it just about more wells? Do you think you took some share away from somebody there?
Tim Probert: This is obviously an important extension for us and I don’t believe that we can say specifically that we’re taking any additional or significant amount of additional share away. We felt it was important just to highlight the fact that there is a significant amount of tender activity at the moment and these volumes are really quite significant and perhaps give you a little bit of steer with respect to how our customers are behaving at the moment with respect their forward activity. In fact, we’ve been quite pleased with the overall spending patterns of our IOC and NOC customers in the first half and that continues to follow the patterns which they’d established in the late fourth quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Urban – Deutsche Bank
Mike Urban – Deutsche Bank: I wanted to try and reconcile some of the comments on the international markets broadly speaking. You were pretty clear that you expect some further margin degradation there but at the same time you’ve got a number of tenders go forward, sounds like some projects shaking loose. Would it be fair to say that you feel like you’ve seen the activity bottom internationally and then just in terms of the operating income impact its going to depend on how much the activity is offset by the margin. Am I hearing you correctly on that?
Tim Probert: We have to be quite realistic in that from the international market is following what we would say is traditional cycle. As I mentioned in my segment of the call we are seeing continued decline in the high value rigs, the offshore rigs which for us represent about 50% of our activity in the international market. We are in a cycle, we are seeing these declines in these high value rigs and even though bidding activity is up quite significantly from Q1 that sort of suggests to us that based on the start updates we start to see incremental activity later this year. As Dave pointed out obviously the tendering process at the current time is much more aggressive then it was at say this time last year so it’s only reasonable to expect that we’ll see some decline in margin. Ultimately obviously is somewhat offset by volume increase and as Dave also mentioned we have a significant investment in technology and one of the reasons we have that obviously is because it provides us the potential upside on any given contract to provide technological advantages during the life of a given contract.
Mike Urban – Deutsche Bank: Shifting back to North America you’d referenced a nice contract win from an IOC in North America, presumably that’s a trend that you would expect to see more of going forward as the large IOCs and even some of the NOCs being bigger players in North America is that reasonable to expect?
Dave Lesar: If you look who were making the big investments and the big plays in the Rocky Mountain gas over the past several years it clearly was a move back into that market by the IOCs. Now you’re also starting to see the IOCs make major investments and major inroads into some the shale plays. I think that as they get more heavily involved totally through the US gas cycle I think it bodes well for us because typically they are looking for more packaged services to try to keep their costs down.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Crandell – Barclays Capital
Jim Crandell – Barclays Capital: It seems to me in US stimulation you’ve have sort of a utilization oriented strategy in that market. Can you specifically comment on what you consider to be the success of that strategy and maybe give us a feel for both utilization and price discounts in the US stimulation market?
Tim Probert: We certainly have had utilization strategy in North America and I think the North American team have really executed that extremely well as the numbers would show. I think that the key element I think to that was acting early and really being focused on those customers in basins which it appeared to us had the highest potential for activity. As I say, the team has done an excellent job in executing that.
Jim Crandell – Barclays Capital: No specifics?
Tim Probert: No specifics.
Jim Crandell – Barclays Capital: Can you comment, I know you seem to be less optimistic on some on how quickly you think Iraq will unfold? Can you give us your expectations about that market and the contract structure that will likely occur particularly with the IOCs in that market?
Dave Lesar: In my view the Iraq market continues to be a little bit open as to what the contracting philosophy is going to look like. We are having discussions essentially with every IOC that’s interested in going in there. I think that the IOCs will probably use the service companies on a more traditional basis. There may be some packaged services but I think for the most part they’re going to want to pick and choose like they typically do. We’re also having discussions with some of the smaller players and also with the Iraqi national oil companies and there may be enhanced opportunities there to look at something on a broader basis maybe and IPM basis, maybe a package stop basis. I just am a little more cautious then maybe some are about how quickly that market is going to develop as the year sort of unfolds here.  There’s no doubt it we’re excited about it, we are focused on it, we are investing in it right now. We’ll have to see where the market and how the market comes to us before I think we’re going to see any meaningful level of revenue generated out of there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden: I think I heard you say on North America that you weren’t prepared to give any margin guidance but it wasn’t going to be 300 to 500 basis points. Either I miss-heard you or if not maybe you could clarify that. Also on the clarification that 300 to 500 basis points in regards to international margin erosion is something you expect to be steady over the next six quarters and then what?
Mark McCollum: The international markets right now, yes when we talk about the 300 to 500 it’s going to be a slow bleat out over time as different projects come underway and I think it will be biased toward the late part of this year and early part of next year when we’ll start seeing that. We do expect it to go out. Beyond 2010 we don’t have any reason to believe it won’t be stable after that point. A lot of these tenders will be active then for a number of years. On the North America market I just want to be clear we’re not giving specific guidance. It will not be as severe as the 300 to 500 basis points of margin degradation we talked about in the international markets but we don’t know where it will be underneath that. We are saying that there is still continued risk for some margin degradation in Q3. One because we don’t really know whether activity is fully stabilized and number two because the margins in the back part of Q2 were lower on a monthly basis then they were at the beginning of Q2. Just think about the average margin for Q2 versus the leading edge margin it was lower and that’s going to have an impact. Offsetting that will be the impact of some of the cost saving initiatives that Tim talked about as well as any further other cost initiatives that we will undertake to make sure that we stay ahead of it or can get ahead of it to the best that we can.
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden: Would the seasonal progression of Canadian activity be meaningful in terms of helping the North American margins?
Dave Lesar: It certainly will help. Canada is only about 3% in terms of our total revenue so it’s a fairly small percentage but clearly anything can help in terms of an activity pick up. We do usually experience higher activity in the third quarter than any other point in the year. All things equal if rig count stabilizes then that certainly will pick up in activity in Canada and the rest of the US will help us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Sanchez – Howard Weil
Bill Sanchez – Howard Weil: I was hoping maybe you comment, we’ve heard about some international activity pick ups here. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about Manifa and where that stands.
Tim Probert: The project is clearly still on the books. It is underway but at a much lower rate than had been originally anticipated clearly before the collapse in the global economy. There certainly are a number of scenarios which are being considered with respect to the speed and the rate at which that may pick up. I think it’s a bit premature to discuss those in a lot of detail. Though I think Dave you may have a few comments about that.
Dave Lesar: I would just go with what Tim said. It has not been cancelled, it’s been deferred. We did win the major offshore portion of that. I’m actually going to be leave here this afternoon and go straight to Saudi. I’ll have a much better idea within the next couple days where it sits. I would say at some point in time they will move forward with that project.
Bill Sanchez – Howard Weil: Is it too early to give a read on the 2010 CapEx at this point or maybe a range that you could talk about for next year?
Mark McCollum: It is a bit premature to talk specifics about the 2010. I think though if you see what we have done over the last several years we have tried to fairly level load our CapEx spend, balancing a higher percentage toward international markets, a higher percentage of our capital toward our well construction product service lines. I don’t think that that will change in terms of our planning for 2010.  I think as we go into the later part of the year we’ll be very focused on the level of activity, the capital needs to address a number of these tenders that we have won which will be influencing some of the spend in the early part of 2010 to make our decisions about that.
Operator: Your last question comes from Waqar Syed – Tristone Capital
Waqar Syed – Tristone Capital: My question is regarding international gas outside of North America. What are you seeing there, what are the chances of growth later this year and then into 2010, 2011 timeframe and which markets do you see the most growth potential and how is Halliburton positioned?
Dave Lesar: I think we’re very well positioned mainly by leveraging the capability, the technology and experience we’ve developed in the US gas market. If you look at the unconventional plays around the world there are a number of basins that look very interesting. You have sort of the corbett methane plays in Australia, a number of large investments by some of our major customers in CBM and Australia in an attempt to get an LNG plant off the ground there. I was just recently through Europe and a fairly high interest in shale plays and producing gas out of those shales and then into underground storage in the European market. Of course you have an emerging tight gas potential in Saudi Arabia. I think we’re well positioned, we’re very excited about the transfer of this technology into these plays around the world and I don’t see that any of them are going to provide a significant revenue stream in 2009 but certainly as we get into 2010 you could start to see some of them develop a meaningful revenue stream for us.
Operator: I will now turn the conference back over to you.
Christian Garcia: Thank you everyone for your participation in today’s call.
Operator: This does conclude today’s program. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Executives: Christian Garcia - Vice President, Investor Relations Dave Lesar - Chief Executive Officer Mark McCollum - Chief Financial Officer Tim Probert - Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development
Analysts: Brad Handler – Credit Suisse Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital Bill Sanchez – Howard Weil, Inc.  Michael LaMotte – J.P. Morgan Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering & Co.  Mike Irvin – Deutsche Bank  
Operator: Welcome to Halliburton’s first quarter 2009 earnings call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Christian Garcia, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please begin.
Christian Garcia:  Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2009 conference call. Today's call is being web cast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the first quarter results is available on the Halliburton website.  Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO and Tim Probert, President, Drilling and Evaluation Division and Corporate Development. In today's call Dave will provide opening remarks. Mark will discuss our overall financial performance and liquidity position and Tim will provide comments on our operations and business outlook. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks.  Before turning the call over to Dave, I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and recent current reports on Form 8K.   During the first quarter of 2009 we restated our historical financial statements with the adoption of certain new accounting pronouncements and transferred selected operations from Completion and Production to the Drilling and Evaluation segment. For more details on the effect of this restatement and prior periods please refer to our earnings release. Note that we will be using the term international to refer to our operations outside the U.S. and Canada and we will refer to the combination of U.S. and Canada as North America.   Now I'll turn the call over to Dave Lesar. Dave?  
Dave Lesar: Thank you Christian and good morning everyone. The industry experienced an unprecedented decline in activity in the first quarter which obviously had an impact on our financial results. The U.S. rig count has dropped over 50% from its August 2008 peak and there can be no certainty on when the decline in activity will bottom out. This downturn so far is worse than previous cycles in terms of the speed of the decline. The steep drop off in activity has led to reduced volumes and intense pricing pressure for the remaining available work and therefore has caused severe compression in margin for all of the services industry.  Outside of North America the international markets were more resilient than the domestic market. However, our business started to see the deferral of several projects in line with the behavior of past cycles. We are also seeing EMP operators focusing their efforts on removing service cost inflation on our domestic and international projects by seeking to secure cost concessions from their supply chain.  Here is a summary of our first quarter results. Total revenue was $3.9 billion and represented a decline of 3% from the first quarter of 2008. This is against a backdrop of a 19% decline in worldwide rig count year-over-year. On a macro basis, I believe that this shows our strategy of balancing our geographic and product line portfolios continues to be successful. Despite a 30% year-over-year decline in North American rig activity and the impact of price degradation, our North American revenues declined on 10% year-over-year due to share increases in select locations and favorable service mix from shale plays.  North America margins declined to 14% resulting from lower volumes and intense pricing pressures. International revenues grew 3% from the first quarter of 2008 with Latin America contributing growth of 9%. Our international growth was significantly affected by unfavorable year-over-year currency movements in select locations but notably the North Sea, Mexico and Brazil. However, overall international margins remained a healthy 20%.  These results indicate that we have executed well in a very challenging environment. Our strategy of protecting or increasing our market share, lowering our input costs and growing our business in select locations has helped mitigate the impact of this downturn on our financial performance.  Let me now turn to the results of North America and look at our prospects for the coming year. North America revenue dropped 25% on a sequential basis on a 30% sequential decline in rig count. The largest declines came in the Permian Basin, the Rockies and the mid-Continent. Although our revenue drop was substantial I believe this was a good performance given the 30% rig count drop and significantly lower revenue opportunities which were then compounded by pricing pressures on all remaining work as everyone tried to keep their equipment utilized.  We had less severe activity fall off in the complex shale plays like the Haynesville and horizontal drilling in the Northeast. Activities in these areas, along with the Gulf of Mexico, and their associated service intensity assisted in moderating the effect of this weak drilling environment in the first quarter. In addition, as we have stated before there was a group of customers who wanted to work with us because of our proven track record and superior technology that we could not serve in the past because of equipment shortages. With the decline in activity we have now been able to begin to serve these customers. However, all markets remain susceptible to additional adjustments by our customers.  Canada has also shown a lower drop off in revenue than the U.S. land and has now entered spring break up season. We expect Canadian activity will not recover to pre-break up levels in the latter half of the year. We also saw price erosion in all product lines and expect that pricing for our services will remain under pressure until activity stabilizes. The timing of when national gas supply and demand fundamentals improve is uncertain. We expect that customers will continue to look at and adjust their spending plans until this happens.  We indicated in our fourth quarter call that we expect that the activity decline will lead to a supply response sometime before the end of the second quarter. Recent data points that we are seeing, although still inconclusive, provide us with positive indications that this may occur. We expected that 70-75% of our North America margin compression would come in the first quarter. Given the unprecedented decline in the rig count and the added impact of the financial crisis on our customers’ ability to access the capital markets I believe we will continue to see additional margin compression in our North America business.  Let’s look at our international business for a second. We believe that Latin America will continue to be a bright spot in 2009 with increased activity in Brazil and Mexico. We expect to expand our already strong position in those markets by continuing penetration of our differentiated well construction technologies. We expect that worldwide deep water activities for development work will be resilient in this weak commodity market. Deep water provides our company with significant opportunities as customers value our unique technologies to increase their productivity in these challenging reservoirs. We enjoy leading deep water positions on a global basis and cementing completions, stimulation and a number two position in directional drilling, LWD and drilling fluids.  The current downturn is different from past cycles due to the overlay of the global credit crisis in combination with broad demand weakness. Certain international markets such as Russia and the North Sea are already exhibiting particular weakness in activity due to the lack of access to external financing to fund development projects. Resolution of capital access issues will be key to restoring activities in these markets for the remainder of the year.  We have also seen our international customers seek to improve their project economics by reducing execution inefficiencies and lowering costs in their supply chain. It is our intention to leverage the full breadth of our solutions portfolio to assist our customers in meeting their objectives. We think our broad based integrated offering is a key competitive advantage in this market place.  In the first quarter activity drop offs have been sharp and have accelerated throughout the quarter and we took actions to offset some of the impact of the downturn on our financial results. We have eliminated discretionary spending and consolidated operations in areas of reduced activities. Our large international infrastructure has provided us an opportunity to lower our vendor costs from the supply chains we have built up over the past year and Tim will provide you with progress in this area when we talks in a few minutes.  While it has been our desire to minimize headcount reductions during this down cycle we found it necessary to reduce personnel in the first quarter. We said last quarter our objective was to live within our cash flows and despite the FCPA settlements we generally accomplished this in the first quarter. We invested $518 million in capital expenditures in line with our build program for the year. We continue to believe in the long-term prospects of this business and our goal is to continue with our capital program in a range of $1.8 billion which is about the same as last year.  It is a well known fact that the industry’s equipment was used extensively in the last up turn and the entire industry needed to refresh its capital fleet. Our capital program allows us to one, refresh our equipment that has been heavily utilized during peak periods; two, build new and more robust technologies for deep water and higher horse power units for the new shale plays and for higher pressure, higher temperature environments; three, our current environment allows us the benefit to lower supply chain costs so we can build more for the same amount of money.  This capital expenditure program is consistent with our strategy of balancing growth and returns. We have historically generated one of the highest returns in the industry and we believe this strategy will continue to deliver superior, long-term value for our shareholders. As I stated in our fourth quarter call, we will draw upon our management’s deep experience in navigating through previous downturns. Our first quarter results indicate that so far I believe we have executed well in addressing the industry’s current challenges. We have successfully increased our market position in several areas in North America while growing in key markets internationally.  We continued our investments in technology which will expand our competitive advantage and position us for longer term leadership in key markets. I would like Mark McCollum now to go over in more detail the financial results for the quarter. Mark? 
Mark McCollum:  Thanks Dave. Good morning. I will be comparing our first quarter results sequentially to the fourth quarter of 2008. Our revenue in the first quarter was $3.9 billion, down $1 billion or 20% from the fourth quarter as all of our product service lines showed marked declines from the previous quarter. As Dave mentioned, a steep curtailment in activity and corresponding pricing pressure affected our overall financial performance. In addition, we experienced seasonal declines resulting from the normal fourth quarter spike in revenue for landmark software, completions and direct sales.  On a geographic basis, all regions registered declining revenues with North America experiencing a 25% sequential decline resulting from price erosion and the 30% drop in the average rig count. As a result, North America operating income dropped by 57% sequentially and margins have now declined by approximately 1,100 basis points since activity peaked in the third quarter of 2008.  In our fourth quarter call we discussed that in the 2001/2002 cycle our overall North America margins declined by 1,200 basis points from peak to trough. Given that the current U.S. downturn is more pronounced than the previous cycle, we are currently anticipating we will experience additional North American margin compression which could exceed that level by another 300-500 basis points in the short-term. Ultimately, the overall contraction of our North America margins will be dependent on the eventual depth and length of the industry’s downturn.  International revenue decreased by 17% sequentially due to lower activity and the typical seasonal declines for landmark, completion tools and direct sales of manufactured equipment. Overall, operating income decreased $547 million or 47% from the fourth quarter of 2008 resulting from lower activity, pricing erosion and employee separation costs partially offset by cost savings previously mentioned by Dave.  Our fourth quarter 2008 results included a $35 million gain from the settlement of a patent dispute which was recognized at corporate and other. Our first quarter 2009 results included $28 million in employee separation costs. These costs are incorporated in each of our segments and regions as well as in corporate and other depending upon the location of the affected personnel.  Unlike other companies, we have not excluded these costs in the comparisons that follow. Now I will highlight the segment results. Completion and Production revenue decreased $524 million or 21% from the fourth quarter while operating income was down 42%. The decline in revenue was driven primarily by lower production enhancement results in the U.S. land and seasonal declines in completions revenue.  Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis, North America revenue decreased 26% and operating income declined by 57%. We experienced significant declines resulting from both decreased activity and price reductions. As Dave mentioned, declines were most significant in the Permian Basin, Rockies and mid-Continent areas and these areas had the most margin compression as well.  In Latin America, Completion and Production revenue decreased 10% but operating income increased 6% from the fourth quarter as lower activity in Venezuela was offset by higher margin sales in Mexico and Brazil. In Europe, Africa, CIS Completion and Production revenue decreased 14% and operating income declined 30% due to lower vessel utilization and declines in the North Sea, Kazakhstan and Russia. Partially offsetting the declines in these locations were revenue increases in North Africa from higher submitting activity.  In Middle East/Asia, Completion and Production posted a sequential decrease in revenue and operating income of 16% and 22% respectively due to higher completion tool sales in the fourth quarter.  In our Drilling and Evaluation division revenue decreased $479 million or 20% and operating income declined 46% with unfavorable sequential results in nearly all product service lines. Typical fourth quarter increases in software sales and direct sales contributed to the decline. In addition, the division experienced significant activity weakness in North America, Russia, Venezuela and the North Sea. In North America, Drilling and Evaluation revenue declined 24% and operating income decreased 59% with all product service lines registering sequential decreases.  On a percentage basis, Sperry’s revenue declined the least among the product service lines in this division as it benefited from a favorable mix towards horizontal drilling which now accounts for over 40% of total rig count. In addition, Sperry had sequential revenue increase in the Gulf of Mexico as activity shifted towards drilling rather than completions in the quarter.  Drilling and Evaluation’s Latin America revenue declined 22% and operating income decreased 47% driven by lower activity across the region but most notably in Mexico and Venezuela. The division benefited from strong Sperry activity and seasonal revenue increases for landmark in the fourth quarter of 2008.  In the Europe, Africa, CIS region Drilling and Evaluation revenue decreased 16% and operating income declined 39% due to lower Sperry and wire line direct sales activity in Russia and North Africa. We continue to expect growth in North Africa for the remainder of the year.  Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income in the Middle East/Asia were down 20% and 38% respectively. Lower direct sales in Asia and weak activity in Saudi Arabia were the primary drivers for the decline. We are currently ramping down the Khurais project and expect that demobilization will be complete by the middle of the second quarter. We are anticipating that our work on the Manifa project would partially offset the revenue impact of the finalization of Khurais. However, the start up of the off shore portion of this project has been deferred.  Now I will address some additional financial items. In the first quarter we issued $1 billion of 10-year senior notes at a fixed rate of 6.15% and $1 billion of 30-year senior notes with a fixed rate of 7.45% for a total of $2 billion. While these notes provide incremental carrying cost of approximately $34 million per quarter, we believed it was prudent to issue them when we saw a window in the market rather than be dependent upon the proper functioning of the credit markets at whatever future point in time we might need to access them. These notes provide us with additional flexibility to weather this financial storm and to take advantage of potential strategic opportunities on our terms and within our timing.  As of March 31, we had $3 billion of cash and equivalents, an increase of $1.8 billion from December 31 primarily resulting from the $2 billion note issuance. For the first quarter we used $84 million of cash before financing activities primarily due to the settlement payments related to the FCPA investigation of $274 million. Without these payments we would have generated positive cash flow consistent with our focus on working capital management and cash generation.  We anticipate that corporate expenses will be approximately $50-55 million per quarter for the rest of the year. We expect our 2009 effective income tax rate will remain in the range of 32-33%. Finally, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $225-230 million per quarter or about $900 million in total during 2009.  Tim? 
Tim Probert:  Thanks Mark. Good morning everyone. Drilling activity declines within the current North America cycle have been discussed in some detail but let me add a few comments on pricing. The current pricing environment is extremely challenging but the actions we have taken have been consistent with our focus on protecting our share and improving our market position.  While the eventual depth of the North American cycle is uncertain it is worth noting that the sub-cycle of oil directed activity is exhibiting signs of a bottom. The international down cycle is underway with rig count falling by 9% from the September peak in 2008. Using past cycles as a guide there is a clear risk of a further decline in the international drilling market under current demand and commodity price scenarios. Generally, past international cycles demonstrate differences in amplitude and time frame compared to the U.S. International cycles tend to be shallower and longer in duration and follow U.S. cycles by one or two quarters, much like we are experiencing now.  International work is primarily driven by larger IOC’s and NOC’s involving more complex projects and involve service contracts with longer terms. These attributes have historically made international activity lag during periods of rising commodity prices but likewise slower to adjust when oil prices fall. What is so unique about this international cycle is the pace at which our customers have focused their efforts on lowering the cost of their projects. According to CERA, upstream capital costs have increased by 130% since 2000 with much of the cost rising since 2005.  While it is important to point out this data includes execution inefficiencies as well as inflation, operators have approached their key service providers to facilitate the reduction of their project costs nonetheless. We are working closely with them to trade an expansion of scope and the lengthening of duration with contract renegotiation milestones and price concessions.  Improving international project economics is a key driver for our customers and it is incumbent on us to participate in this effort which in some respects could lead to what could be characterized as a cost inefficiency led recovery in the current price environment. To address the impact on margins, we are focusing our efforts to lower our input costs across our global network. Of our total costs about 1/3 of personnel base and 2/3 are dependent on our supply chain management structure in one form or another.  We have targeted 17 categories that represent 60% of this spend comprising several hundred suppliers from whom we are seeking reduced pricing to match current market realities. In the first quarter we finalized negotiations with suppliers that represent over half of the targeted spend. Additionally, we are benefiting from new manufacturing centers in emerging markets opened in 2008. As activity weakens in 2009 we are carefully preserving work in our lower cost manufacturing centers located in Malaysia, Singapore, Mexico and Brazil.  The timing of lower supply costs being reflected in our financial results is a function of several factors including our inventory turn over rate. We do not expect to see meaningful impact of these cost savings until the second half of the year. As Dave pointed out it was also necessary to take more significant actions relating to our labor related costs in the quarter than we had expected earlier.  For example, we have reduced our headcount in North America by 12% in the quarter. Overall, international margin pressure was modest in the first quarter and while we are working hard to mitigate its impact we expect the pressure will intensify in the coming quarters. The less acute trajectory of the international cycle does however afford us the opportunity to address many aspects of our cost structure on a more timely basis. As a result, ultimate pressure on margins will be less severe than North America.  Dave? 
Dave Lesar :  Thanks Tim. Let me just wrap up with a few closing comments and then we will open it up for questions. I think as the first quarter results show I believe we responded well to the unprecedented decline the industry has experienced in the first quarter. We have protected our overall market share and included and enhanced it in other areas. We have made significant progress in lowering our supplier costs and continue to make strategic investments that will expand our competitive advantage.  Industry prospects will continue to be weak in the coming quarter and visibility so the ultimate depth and length of this cycle remains a bit uncertain. However, we are confident that our management team is prepared to meet the challenges that are forthcoming.  Let’s go ahead and open it up for questions. 
 :
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Brad Handler – Credit Suisse.
Brad Handler – Credit Suisse: Can you please amplify a little on your U.S., North American margin comments? I think I heard you say down another 300-500 basis points from the first quarter level but perhaps I just want to clarify if I heard that right or was it 300-500 basis points from a different reference point first of all? Then as a related side question can you comment on the March exit margin at all, or perhaps we are already close to that down 300-500 basis points in March? Are you looking for something that is potentially already kind of flattish if that is the guidance? 
Mark McCollum:  I don’t know that I can comment on our March exit margins but I can clarify the comment on the 300-500 basis points. That was in reference to the 1,200 basis point decline we had seen back in 2001 and 2002. As Dave mentioned, we were expecting to see about 70-75% of the overall margin decline in the first quarter. Based on what we saw happen during the first quarter we are sort of extrapolating on what we think will happen again over the next short-term period. Obviously it is a very fluid environment. I think the ultimate extent to what the margin compression will be in this cycle is going to be very dependent upon the length and the depth of the downturn, how far rigs fall and the resulting excess capacity that we see in the market as customers continue to adjust their capital plans and there is going to be excess capacity in certain product service lines. It could be different over the longer term, but this is sort of what we can see at this point in time. 
Brad Handler – Credit Suisse: Is that time frame near enough that you are basically saying you are not getting any of the benefits from cost savings in that? So this is purely the revenue and the volume and pricing pressures could take you down another 500 basis points for a total of 1,700 basis points I think you said from a year ago? 
Tim Probert:  With respect to the reduction of our input costs as I have explained, absolutely the adjustments that have been made to personnel which we unfortunately had to make in Q1, the 60% of that cost structure which is represented by our supply chain we don’t expect to hit until the second half of the year. We obviously have to move it completely through our inventory and with the slowing of activity that has a tendency to reduce the number of turns which you see in the system. So I think it is appropriate to reflect any those savings during the course of the second half of the year. 
Dave Lesar:  Let me sort of summarize I think what you have heard. The issue is that price compression is today and is now. So as Mark has indicated, I think we are looking at potentially a 300-500 basis points additional pressure off the margins we saw in Q1. Of course that is going to be dependent on where the rig count ends up bottoming. Then I believe we will start to get some help in the back part of the year as we start to push through some of the cost savings we are now starting to get from our customers through our financial statements and hopefully that will mitigate and maybe reverse some of the margin hit we are taking at this point in the year. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup. 
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: In staying with the North America theme, in terms of the activity decline you are seeing and your response to it, what part of your current strategy in response to this downturn is more of a permanent or structural nature? You mentioned that Permian, Rockies and mid-Continent are down worse than other markets. I assume you kind of have a view of where activity will recover and where it will not. I would just ask you to address that question of how much permanent cost reduction are you taking out now based on your view of the market going forward? 
Tim Probert:  There are two elements really I think. Number one is, ultimately does activity come back? I should say at what level will it come back assuming it will not come back to the same level as we went into the downturn. That is point number one. Then point number two relates to the geography of where will the focus be. Clearly I think we will definitely see some differences with respect to the picture of North America as we come out of the down cycle and clearly we are making adjustments to our infrastructure to reflect that. Truly I think to sort of telegraph what changes we might be making to those structural elements of our business probably is a little bit premature at present. 
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: You mentioned your strategy on the international side of trying to get some value in return for lowering your prices or granting some price concessions in already negotiated contracts in terms of either lengthening the contracts or something that would give you value for what you are giving up, are you having success at that? Is that something that is going over well? 
Tim Probert:  There are a couple of key levers we can pull with respect to the situation. Number one obviously is duration. That gives us an opportunity to extend the duration beyond the current down cycle of the industry. The second relates to scope. That is to add additional services or products into a contract which may not necessarily be currently in place. The third lever is semi-tied to that and it is the opportunity to renegotiate a certain element. It could be commodity price. It could be some other element of time duration, for example. So I say yes, we are having some success in negotiating along those lines. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets. 
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets: The international market you sound a bit more constructive relative to prior cycle terms. Is it fair to say you don’t expect to see the same sort of margin compression that let’s say you experienced during the 1997 to 1999 downturn in the international markets? You think it will look more like 2001/2002 or maybe somewhere in between? 
Dave Lesar:  I think we really only have sort of one quarter of data points in front of us in terms of the international market but I would say it is behaving more like the latter than it is the former at this point in time and that is where we would expect it to turn out given what we see right now. 
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets: It seems like coming into the year, January and February; all your customers pretty much had put everything on hold, giving you actually zero visibility. The conversations I have had the last couple of weeks it seems there have been some settled change in intonation where customers are now giving you some general sense of what they are planning on doing for the rest of the year. Are you seeing the same thing? Is that adding to your confidence? What do you think the trigger point was for the customers to all of a sudden start to give you more visibility? 
Dave Lesar:  I think there are a number of questions there. A lot of it had to do with the fact that we have had significant discussions with our customers about their plans because they went through many, many iterations of their own capital budgets before they announced anything and then are constantly updating them. So part of the discussion is just give us some indication of what you are going to do here so we can make sure we have the people and the equipment available and that the industry doesn’t look at either closing down locations or furloughing employees or stacking equipment and then you, Customer XYZ, turn around and want some services. So part of it was just a more intensive dialogue with our customers about their plans.  I think you are seeing a variety of behavior in the market place today. You have some customers that are just flat shutting gas production until the pricing gets better. We have a subset of customers that are drilling but not completing wells. We have some customers that are drilling and completing and then shutting their production in. So the discussions we are having with them are on a day-to-day basis, on a rig-to-rig basis about what their plans are for that rig, where it is going to go, what it is going to be doing and what services we are going to get on that. So, I am not sure that we are getting any clearer of a picture as to where ultimately it might go but the communication is a lot more intensive than it has been. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley. 
Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley: If I understand you correctly you seem to indicate that margins will trough in the second half of the year, sorry in the second quarter in North America you will get some benefit of the cost reductions in the second half but that it is too early to talk about what sort of shape the recovery will be. If you look at internationally, again, I think the bait right now is does this market trough in 2010, in other words benefiting in a big way from contracts signed at historic prices this year that will gradually roll over and result in lower margins in 2010? It just strikes me that thought is a little too simplistic in that the volume you will execute under a contract might vary radically compared to whether we have a first quarter environment and everybody is trying to figure out the global economy and everything else under the sun. Could you just again bring us up to speed on how you are seeing this dynamic play out in the various regions around the world? [inaudible] see certain margins internationally that might already have troughed? 
Dave Lesar:  Let me take a first shot at that. I think unlike the U.S. business which has traditionally been more of a short-term or a call out sort of business, pricing has collapsed ahead of our ability and the industry’s ability to sort of push cost through our supply chain to try and preserve the margin base. I think the one positive aspect of the discussions we are having with our customers on the international front right now, because we know what contracts we hold, we know what option periods those contracts involve and we know the discussions we are having about either expanding scope or expanding the duration and the fact these are contracts we know we will have 12-24 months from now, we are better able to get our supply chain costs in line with the sort of cost reductions that our customers are asking for. Therefore, I don’t think you will see the mismatch of our prices going down but our costs not being able to closely follow. I think we will be able to more closely match the revenue reduction opportunities with the cost and supply chain reduction side of it. I don’t believe that you are going to see as far as we can see at this point in time the sort of margin compression you are having in the U.S. in the international market place. 
Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley: One follow-up. You mentioned a 9% down rig count but a lot of the business is also rigless. What are you seeing in terms of volume in general under your [frame] agreements? Is any of that internationally starting to pick up? You are talking about there are several types of activity that could be curtailed if a company wanted to be cash conservation mode. Are you seeing any of this turn around yet? 
Tim Probert:  I think it sort of varies from place to place. If we take a look at the North Sea, for example, or the U.K. sector of the North Sea there were only 18 exploration and appraisal wells drilled during the course of the first quarter. In that case there is a fair amount of rigless activity, intervention activity which is planned. In other areas where there are major projects planned, the rigless activity sometimes takes a second seat or a back seat to the major capital programs. So it is a little bit difficult to generalize.  However, I think in a reasonable price commodity environment there certainly are plenty of opportunities for rigless activities to essentially bolster the overall revenue stream. 
Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley: To sum it up, should margins drop in 2009 or 2010 internationally? 
Tim Probert:  I think it is a little too early to say at the moment. We are sort of one quarter into this and as you know; let me just sort of add one thing to emphasize that many of our customers are very concerned about their overall project costs. Those concerns are clearly being manifested in terms of the discussions we are having with them as there are others. It is the timing of them getting back to their primary programs which will determine the exact trough whether it is in 2009 or in 2010. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital. 
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: My first question is about the horrific price discounting in simulation in the U.S. Given where we are on a capacity utilization basis with less than 50% and given there is some 13-14 publicly traded or significant private companies in the business is it possible or maybe even likely that even in a recovery we may not see pieces recover or recover much at all in that business? 
Tim Probert:  I think that clearly we are seeing some extreme pricing pressure right now. I think we are seeing some of the smaller suppliers clearly pricing on a cash basis which is placing quite a bit of stress in the system. I think that is quite clear. In terms of a recovery I think we just have to look back at past cycles to be our best guide in terms of the way in which pricing recovers and I think that clearly as we discussed a little earlier during Robin’s question the industry is going to look quite a lot different, I think, when it recovers this time. I think that we are going to certainly ensure that we place ourselves in a position where we take best advantage of the newer plays and structure ourselves to take advantage of a rising pricing environment. 
Dave Lesar:  Let me just add a little bit to that. We have talked on a number of calls that there is a lot of pressure pumping and there are a lot of pressure pumping companies out there but we really don’t compete head to head against very many of them. We have focused on the high pressure, high temperature, high horse power type gas, CBM shale plays end of the business and I really work with a select group of customers. That group of customers is going to be there, is going to survive through this and is going to continue to want our technology and our capability when we get out the other end of this. I think that for the part of business that we compete in and the customer base we have, I don’t think I would be as concerned about our ability to get price increases at the time when this thing turns. 
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: I would just say there is a lot of anecdotal evidence on big, multi-stage jobs fact pricing by Haliburton and others being 40% down or more in the market place and I would say that the weakness in pricing is certainly not just a shallow area that you don’t compete in. It seems to be squaring in your markets as well. 
Dave Lesar:  Well it is easy to point to an individual job with an individual customer where a pricing decision got made but I think we are pretty confident when the supply demand tightens up we should be able to look at price increases at that point. 
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: Just a follow-up question back to the international markets, certainly your competitors are saying that the Russian market in the U.K. North Sea market, as well as maybe Latin America and Mexico have now bottomed. Would you agree with that particularly in Russia? 
Tim Probert:  I think there is a lot of anecdotal evidence around but we are just going to be cautious in our reflection of that. I think it is just too early to say at the present time. We still are continuing to see some slippage in terms of overall rig count. Again, looking back at history towards a traditional international cycle we still have a ways to go yet. So I really think one quarter into this thing is just too early to say. 
Dave Lesar:  Let me just add, I think of the two markets you referenced I think we feel that the Russia market on the long-term and even in the short-term probably is closer to turning around than the North Sea is. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Bill Sanchez – Howard Weil, Inc. 
Bill Sanchez – Howard Weil, Inc. : I was curious if you could provide a little bit of color as we are hearing about IOC’s gearing up for upstream beginning in Iraq. I thought perhaps you could share your thoughts as far as Halliburton’s position there and your outlook? 
Tim Probert:  Halliburton has a long history in Iraq through the years. Whilst we have a presence there and we are generating revenue in Iraq, we don’t have operations on the ground currently. We are obviously monitoring very closely the activities both in terms of the potential for service contracts with the majors in Iraq and also conventional activity we certainly feel notwithstanding security issues which could still derail current plans that there will be some significant opportunity there over the next 3-4 years. 
Bill Sanchez – Howard Weil, Inc. : Is that something you are gearing up for now to take advantage of a 2011 or 2012 type situation? What is the time frame for you getting on the ground there? 
Dave Lesar:  Let me add to that. I think there are really two sort of troughs that will go on in Iraq. We are having discussions with any large number of IOC’s about their ongoing discussions with the Iraqi government about starting up operations there and for us that will be done on a more traditional services type strategy and philosophy. There are also discussions going on at this point in time with some of the Iraqi oil and gas companies about integrated project management, IPM, turnkey, whatever you want to call it type opportunities and we do see that there may be a number of those opportunities start to come up maybe even faster than the opportunities come up with the IOC’s. As Tim has said, we recently won a wire line bid in Iraq so we will start operations in there shortly but I don’t think it will be any meaningfully large addition to our revenue stream certainly for a number of years. 
Bill Sanchez – Howard Weil, Inc. : Tim or Mark, I think last quarter you mentioned the seasonality in fourth quarter 2007 to first quarter 2008 cost Halliburton $0.07. Do you have that number for this quarter? 
Mark McCollum:  Sorry, I don’t have that exact number but I think it was just sort of it was fairly close in line with what we thought it was going to be in terms of the seasonality. For the particular pieces Direct Sales, landmark seasonal declined as well as the completions and how they fell. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Michael LaMotte – J.P. Morgan. 
Michael LaMotte – J.P. Morgan: On the de-mobe around Khurais and the opportunity for replacement work, is there anything in Saudi on the gas side that what country are you looking to reallocate those resources elsewhere in the region or the world? 
Dave Lesar:  As you know, the Saudi’s are very good at sort of reallocating market share within the country once they decide which contractors they want to work for. As we indicated, with Khurais ramping down we thought Manifa would essentially replace it. Manifa has been deferred at this point in time. I still think it will come at some point in time in the future. What they are doing is reallocating some of the rigs that we were on to other rigs they are operating within Saudi. They are also talking about potentially looking at some gas plays and more importantly some tight gas plays that they are very interested in the country. I suspect we will get a shot at doing some of that. 
Michael LaMotte – J.P. Morgan: So when you say de-mobe it is just sort of pulling back Khurais, it is not actually leaving the country? 
Dave Lesar:  At this point in time I think we see that we can reallocate the equipment that we had on Khurais to other opportunities inside of Saudi. 
Michael LaMotte – J.P. Morgan: Was there a performance bonus in the first quarter on early completion surrounding that project? I’m just trying to think about impact potentially on margin Q1 to Q2 in the EMEA region. 
Dave Lesar:  No, that was just a straight up time and materials contract we happened to get very good results on. There was no bonus payment. 
Michael LaMotte – J.P. Morgan: Lastly, if I could ask you to elaborate perhaps on the final statement in your prepared comments on the press release that we will make the strategic investments to emerge even stronger. Are you referring there to the capital program? The strength of it this year and the recapitalization of the fleet? Or were you sort of alluding at a potentially more interesting M&A environment? 
Dave Lesar:  I think what we are trying to do is indicate that we are getting and keeping our powder dry. I think we have not backed off on our technology spend and we have some very interesting technology that is coming down the pipeline. When we are ready to commercialize that we need and want to have the capital budgets available to be able to manufacture and bring that technology to the market place. The refresh of the fleet I think is something that really needed to be done not only by us but by the industry. I think we would look at whatever interesting and strategic M&A opportunities might be out there at that point in time. But as Mark indicated, we want to have the financial firepower to be able to do some combination of all of those and be able to take advantage of whatever the market ends up giving us. 
Michael LaMotte – J.P. Morgan: If we think about strategic initiatives for M&A if there are a handful of reasons to do it, one is consolidating market and rationalizing market, I think the deals that you and others have looked at in the last few years have been more about geographic expansion or broadening product line. Any change in priority from the last few years? Is consolidation more of an interest now? 
Dave Lesar:  I think the prices of the various assets have certainly been sort of marked down to more reasonable values. I think it wouldn’t be in our best interest for me to try and telegraph what direction we would want to go but I think the strategy we have had of niche acquisitions and geographic expansion certainly would still be the top priority but we clearly would and are looking at broader things than that. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering & Co. 
Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering & Co. : I just want to clarify something that came up earlier in the Q&A. I think one of the questions indicated that you said Q2 was the margin trough for North America. Did you say that and do you think, can we just revisit that? 
Dave Lesar:  If you can give me a rig count bottom then I can probably do a better job articulating when we see a margin compression bottom. I think what I was trying to indicate is that the pricing compression I think we will see sooner rather than the mitigating effects of the cost savings. So if you ask me when I believe we will see a pricing compression, margin compression bottom related to pricing I am hoping that it is Q2. If the rig count continues to fall all the way through Q2 and into Q3 then no, Q2 won’t be the bottom because we are going to keep chasing it down at that point in time. I would hope that we would start getting some help from the cost savings in Q3 and even if we were continuing to see price compression that would be mitigating at that point in time. 
Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering & Co. : My other question or follow-up question would be something that hasn’t been talked about I guess for probably six months now. Are the capital markets and the outlook now such that the company would consider share repurchase as one of the options that kind of came off the table when the capital markets closed? Are we open enough now to think about buying back stock or is that back burner at this point? 
Mark McCollum:  I think that we are more open to it than we were maybe six months ago. That is a good question. I think the capital markets have proven more resilient for the higher investment grade companies such as us. We did access the capital market and it seemed that we can continue to do so. It is certainly not our interest to borrow but we would like to use the cash on our balance sheet to grow with capital as well as with prudent M&A opportunities but if they are not out there and we deem it to be the best use of cash to start buying some shares back then you might find us doing so. 
Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering & Co. : So it sounds like CapEx first, M&A secondly and opportunistically share purchase third but no longer off the table? 
Mark McCollum:  Right. Obviously as Dave alluded to in the call it is very important to us this year given the lack of certainty we have about the direction of the financial markets to operate within our cash flow. So that is an important directive and obviously we intend to try to generate cash through this through the unwind of working capital and through some of the cost savings initiatives we have done. We are going to watch it very closely and have a discussion with our Board. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Mike Irvin – Deutsche Bank. 
Mike Irvin – Deutsche Bank : Did I hear you correctly in saying you saw some anecdotal evidence you would expect the supplier response in North American gas during the second quarter or starting during the second quarter? Was that right? 
Tim Probert:  We had said I think during our last call that it was our expectation there would be some sort of supplier response during the second quarter. Dave commented in his prepared remarks that there clearly was, though far from perfect, the data is beginning to emerge that would suggest that might actually take place before the end of Q2. 
Mike Irvin – Deutsche Bank : Could you reconcile that with your additional comments that you have seen a lot of shut ins? That you have seen customers but not complete, complete but then shut in? So is it the current production starts to roll out and if that happens then we get gas price response and you just go back and see the completions come in and the additional production or even [L&G] for that matter. I’m just trying to roll all those together visa vie is it enough that you see rig activity come back or is it just a case where existing production drops and then we bring on completion and you don’t necessarily need to put a drill in every back door. 
Tim Probert:  Clearly our service operations will benefit from completing those completions. Taking a look at the API data the API data sort of tells us that there has been actually a slip in the correlation between drilling and completions over the last quarter or so which sort of adds to the kind of support of the view that there is an inventory of wells in place which are drilled but not completed. Certainly the anecdotal evidence from our field operations provides some support for that too. So, yes but I think the idea is those will get completed into a rising price environment and clearly we will benefit from a service standpoint from that when it takes place. 
Mike Irvin – Deutsche Bank : So it will be more the completion side of the business to which you obviously have a great bit of exposure rather than expecting a rig count rise? Is that fair? 
Tim Probert:  The rig count will come back, clearly those completions will benefit us right away. 
Christian Garcia:  That will do it. Thank you for your participation in today’s call. 
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation. Everyone may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Welcome to your Halliburton fourth quarter 2008 earnings call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Christian Garcia, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Garcia, you may begin.
Christian Garcia:  Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2008 conference call. Today's call is being web cast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. A pod cast download will also be available. The press release announcing the fourth quarter results is available on the Halliburton website.  Joining me today are Dave Lesar, Chief Executive Officer; Mark McCollum, Chief Financial Officer and Tim Probert, Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development. In today's call Dave will provide opening remarks. Mark will discuss our overall financial performance and liquidity position and Tim will provide comments on our operations and business outlook. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks.  Before turning the call over to Dave, I'd like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, and recent current reports on Form 8-K.   Please note that we will be using the term international to refer to our operations outside the U.S. and Canada, and we will refer to the combination of U.S. and Canada as North America.   The company issued a separate press release announcing its prospective settlements with the Department of Justice and the Securities Exchange Commission with regard to the SCPA investigations. As a result, the company recorded an additional charge for discontinued operations of $303 million or $0.34 per diluted share. We refer you to the press release for details about the content and status of the prospective settlements. Due to the sensitive nature of these settlement discussions, we will not address the press release or take any questions related to this matter.  Now I'll turn the call over to Dave Lesar.  
Dave Lesar: Good morning everyone. Our fourth quarter results demonstrated our relentless focus on delivering solid performance despite the prospects of a weakening market environment. We set quarterly operating income records for all of our international regions. I am pleased to share with you the highlights of our fourth quarter performance.  Total company revenue grew 17% from the fourth quarter 2007. Despite a 14% decline in the U.S. rig count from the beginning of the fourth quarter, our North American operations were essentially flat sequentially. Our Latin America region grew 37%. We have been successful in our growth strategy for this region and continue to see expansion opportunities for growth in 2009.  International revenue grew in excess of 15% year-over-year for the quarter with margins of 24%. For 2008, International revenue grew in excess of 22%. Our total company operating margins were 24%, the highest we have seen throughout the year.  These results show why we believe our strategy of protecting our strong U.S. market position and continuing to grow our international operations continue to be very successful.  Let me now turn to the results for North America and discuss our prospects for the coming year.  North America revenue for the fourth quarter was essentially flat from the third quarter despite the 14% drop in rig count I mentioned earlier. We saw a drop off of our activity beginning in late November. The Gulf Coast experienced good sequential growth and then recovered from the third quarter hurricane disruptions. This growth came despite some lingering impacts of the shut in production that continued in the fourth quarter.  So far in 2009 rig counts have fallen sharply and are now roughly 25% below 2008 highs. We expect activity declines in North America to accelerate further in the first quarter.  Capital expenditure adjustments from our customers remain fluid as they adjust their spending to operate within their cash flows in response to a continued drop in national gas fundamentals. Currently we believe that drilling in unconventional reservoirs will continue to be somewhat less vulnerable to the slow down while activity declines are intensifying in conventional plays in the Permian Basin and certain locations in the mid-con and the Rockies.  While we did not experience significant price weakness over the balance of the fourth quarter price declines are occurring and will be most pronounced in the commoditized area. We expect, however, prices to be less affected in those locations where basin and reservoir complexity requires differentiated technologies.  Turning to our international business, 2008 international revenue grew 22% year-over-year as we continued to see good growth across Latin America, North Africa and Asia Pacific. Our Europe, Africa, CIS region showed the least growth from the prior year levels as this region was affected by currency weaknesses as well as slow downs in the North Sea and Nigeria. We had discussed the lack of growth in these areas in prior earnings calls and have put in place mitigating actions. Despite the weak revenue growth the region’s margins were 23%.  Declining oil prices have caused many of our customers to defer several of their international projects. We see the most volatile areas internationally to be the North Sea, Russia and exploration oriented projects. Some of you may be surprised to learn that our Russia business actually showed a 6% sequential growth from the third quarter. The growth came from continued adoption in Russia of our well construction technologies and was also bolstered by direct sales.  Operators have announced, however, a 25% decline in spending for 2009 and we expect to see some contraction of our business in Russia. However we continue to believe in the long-term prospects of this market and will align our business accordingly.  The U.K. sector of the North Sea has also been affected by capital access issues that have constrained the ability of our independent customers to fund their programs. Additionally there has been a deferral of several platform based projects from larger customers until they see commodity price stabilization. We continue to see opportunities for well intervention growth in this market and growth opportunities continue to exist in areas like the deep water market in Latin America where our unique technologies and market position will provide a competitive advantage.  So in summary we see across our markets for North America lower volumes as customers reduce spending and pricing pressure due to access equipment and customer requests for discounts on existing work. In the international market a slow down but not cancellation of existing projects and a deferral of new projects especially exploration and marginal field development.  Our management team has been through many previous downturns and it is our intention to emerge from this cycle much stronger. For competitive purposes we will not lay out our detailed strategy for addressing this business environment. In the short-term we are putting initiatives in place not only to temper the impact of the activity decline on our financial performance but also to make sure we are in an optimal position to take advantage of the market’s eventual recovery.  However, we can talk about the following steps. We intend to protect our market share. We will increase our spending on technology and we will continue to deploy our package services strategy that creates an efficiency model for our customers in the development of their assets. We expect to compensate for some of the impact of price decline by prudent cost management including minimizing discretionary spending, lowering the cost from our vendors and rationalizing headcount in locations experiencing significant activity decline. Although headcount reductions will be made our goal is to minimize the number of employees affected to avoid the high recruitment and training costs we incur when industry fundamentals improve. I believe that this is the right thing to do for the health of our business over a complete cycle.  Next, we intend to operate our business within our cash flows. We have focused our organization on working capital management and will maintain a strong balance sheet to maximize our financial flexibility. We are planning to maintain our capital expenditures at approximately 2008 levels but will adjust as necessary to stay within our cash flows. We are managing our own plants at a level which preserves our ability to ramp up in response to increased future market activity. We plan to retire old equipment and replace it with new capital to improve our aged fleet.  As I stated, we have been through these cycles before. We know what to do and we will execute on that experience. In fact we have historically seen our North America market share increase during downturns and we have no reason to believe that this downturn will be any different.  Let me turn the call over to Mark now to give you a few more details on our financial performance. 
Mark McCollum:  Thanks Dave. Good morning. I’ll begin with our operational highlights and I’ll be comparing our fourth quarter results sequentially to the third quarter.  Our revenue in the fourth quarter was $4.9 billion, up $57 million or 1% from the third quarter led by completion tools which registered growth of 10%. We also benefited from the typical fourth quarter increase in software sales and direct sales of capital equipment.  On a geographic basis, Latin America led all regions with 4% sequential growth driven by strong results in Mexico and Columbia. The sequential growth of our international regions was negatively affected by currency movements in certain countries. These movements however did not have a significant impact on our operating income since our locally denominated revenues are designed to cover our locally denominated costs.  Operating income increased $112 million or 11% from the third quarter 2008. Our fourth quarter results included a $35 million gain from the settlement of a patent dispute while our third quarter results included a $22 million acquisition related charge for Well Dynamics. Both items were included in corporate and other.  Now I will highlight the segment results.  Completion and production revenue decreased $21 million or 1% from the third quarter while operating income was essentially flat. The decline in revenue was driven primarily by lower production enhancement results in U.S. land and the North Sea, offset by strong completion results revenue. Looking at completion and production on a geographic basis, North America revenue decreased 1% and operating income declined by 5%. We experienced strong activity in the early part of the quarter including a recovery in the Gulf of Mexico but saw activity drop off starting in late November particularly in the Rockies. Canada also suffered from unfavorable currency movement.  In Latin America completion and production revenue decreased 6% and operating income declined 18% in the fourth quarter as we recognized the large third quarter completion tools sale in Brazil. We experienced increased demand for completions and sand control systems across all areas of the region but the timing of sales led to the unevenness of results for this product service line.  In Europe, Africa, CIS, completion and production revenue decreased 4% due to lower activity in the North Sea and Russia for both production enhancement and cementing. Despite the revenue decrease C&P operating income increased by 17% resulting from a favorable mix of intelligent completion system sales.  In the Middle East, Asia completion and production posted a sequential revenue increase of 9% as strong completion tool deliveries across the region fully offset decreased production enhancement activity. Operating income sequentially grew by 18% primarily due to higher completion revenue.  In our drilling and evaluation segment revenue increased $78 million or 4% and operating income increased 12% with strong sequential results in nearly all of its product service lines. Typical fourth quarter increases in software sales, increased direct sales in wire line equipment and continued penetration of Sperry technologies in the U.S. land market drove this increase. Baroid was impacted by the slow down of activity in the North Sea and experienced lower activity in U.S. land.  In North America drilling and evaluation revenue increased 1% led by Sperry with growth of 10% as this product service line benefited from the sequential quarterly increase in the average horizontal rig count. Higher Sperry revenue was offset by decreased activity in Baroid and lower commodity prices impacted the results of one of our legacy oil and gas properties. Operating income for the quarter decreased 5% from lower land activity partially offset by increased drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico.  Drilling and evaluation’s Latin America revenue increased 12% and operating income increased by 51% driven by increased activity across the region but most notably in Mexico and Columbia. The division benefited from strong Sperry and Baroid activity and seasonal revenue increases at Landmark.  In the Europe, Africa, CIS region drilling and evaluation revenue increased 5% led by Sperry and wire line activity in Russia, North Africa and Angola. Partially offsetting this revenue growth was weakness in Nigeria and the North Sea. Operating income increased 37% from a favorable mix of services, the impact of direct sales and increased pricing on certain West African projects.  Drilling evaluation revenue and operating income in the Middle East, Asia were essentially flat from the third quarter. Increased revenue in wire line, land mark and security DBS were offset by lower Sperry activity in Asia.  Now I will address some additional financial items.  In the fourth quarter we recognized a $24 million loss related to foreign exchange reflecting the rapid strengthening of the dollar against certain currencies. This amount which is reflected in other net in the income statement below operating income represents the impact of these currency changes on our net un-hedged working capital position.  Fourth quarter 2008 minority interest reflected a $28 million gain net of tax related to an increase in our effective ownership of one of our joint ventures. This change arose from an increase in the dividend rights of the preferred shares we hold which resulted in an increase in our ownership percentage for accounting purposes. The gain reflects the elimination of most of the minority interest we had previously reported related to this entity.  As of December 31, we had $1.1 billion of cash and short-term investments. Our debt to total capitalization is 25% and we do not have any debt maturing until the fourth quarter of 2010.  Before providing any guidance related to 2009 I would like to reiterate Dave’s comments regarding how we intend to operate in this environment. Our first priority is to operate within our cash flows. We have been focused on working capital management for the past few years and our metrics have shown that we have out-performed our peers in this area. We plan to intensify this focus in 2009.  Here are some points of guidance you can use as a starting point but understand that these may shift as the environment dictates.  We anticipate that corporate expenses will be approximately $60 million per quarter in 2009. We currently expect the 2009 effective tax rate to be in the range of 32-33%. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $220-230 million per quarter or about $900 million in total during 2009. Finally, as Dave indicated our 2009 capital expenditures will be roughly in line with 2008 where we were just about $1.8 billion.  We intend to remain flexible given the uncertainty going into 2009. This guidance on capital reflects some spending for carry over projects from the previous year, the deployment of technology and capital to be used to retire old equipment.  Tim? 
Tim Probert:  Thanks Mark. Good morning everyone. Forecasting the depth and length of the current recession and its impact on demand is challenging. While comparisons with historical downturns are difficult to make they do provide us clues on cycle characteristics and supply side response.  First, in North America we believe the speed of the rig count drop correlates well with the depth and length of past downturns. In the 2001 downturn, which we feel is a closer match than that of 1997, deep to trough drilling activity approximated three quarters. So far we have seen a 25% or over 500 rig drop from the Q3 2008 peak. This percentage drop is consistent with the same timeframe in the 2001 cycle.  Second, we estimate base annual production declines for gas in North America to approximate 30%. This decline together with the current trajectory of rig counts suggests to us that supply could begin to show response in Q2. The inventory of drilled and yet to be completed wells is not insignificant however and will, in our opinion, contribute to this lag which should be helpful to us given our strong position in completion and production.  Third, and as expected, the secular trend towards horizontal drilling appears to be much less affected by the down cycle. In the 2001 downturn from peak to trough the proportion of horizontal directed rigs increased from 6% to 8%. In this cycle so far the horizontal rig percentage climbed from 31% in the peak in Q3 to the current level of 37%. Neither horizontal rig count nor shale plays have been immune to reductions in activity but their increased proportions should translate to a more favorable service mix of our differentiated offerings.  As we have pointed out in the past, horizontal drilling translates to a service intensity of 2-5 times that of vertical drilling and is a positive contributor to several of our product lines.  Finally, we started to see signs of pricing weakness in our services in North America in December and January. We can make no prediction as to the outcome but in past cycles the sector has reached margin compression of as much as 1,200 basis points.  In international markets projects and contract structures tend to be longer term oriented than North America. This has historically resulted in significantly less year-over-year volatility however our customers, IOC’s, NOC’s and independents alike are all reassessing their priorities. Project visibility today can best be described as opaque. Service intensity in our international markets as measured per rig has grown over the years but more acutely since 2004 as the underlying trends towards smaller and more complex accumulations drove demand for services. Interestingly the company continued to experience growth in this metric through the 2001 downturn.  Despite negative demand trends it is worth noting that the industry supply issues impacted primarily by accelerating decline curves are more pervasive today than they have been in the past. Non-OPEC production fell in 2008 and is likely to decline in 2009. Russia, which accounted for the majority of the increase in non-OPEC production in the past decade contracted in 2008 and will likely do so again in 2009. Any period of under-investment driven by constraints in operator spending should lead to a resurgence in commodity price.  While the mid-terms remains uncertain we do have some clarity around the first quarter. The company’s results will be subject to the same type of seasonality that we have seen in previous years. Landmark and direct sale activities fall off in the first quarter as they benefit historically from customer’s year-end budgets. Our businesses will be impacted by weather related seasonality that occurs in the Rockies and North Sea in Russia.  These items contributed to an approximate $0.07 per share decline from Q4 2007 to Q1 2008. In 2009 these volumes are significantly larger so this will be more impactful. Also, we will see volume reductions as a result of the drop of U.S. rig count which is already down 20% of the Q4 average of around 1,900 rigs as well as the accompanying price reductions from our fourth quarter contract renegotiations with our customers in North America.  Dave? 
Dave Lesar:  Thanks Tim. In summary, our fourth quarter results demonstrate our ability to execute in a weakening market environment. We grew revenue, operating income and margins despite the curtailment of customer activities in the latter part of the quarter. We set revenue and operating income records for most of our product lines and regions.  As we have discussed, the industry’s prospects in 2009 are more uncertain but we will take the opportunity to strengthen the long-term health of our franchise. We will selectively cut costs as I said but at the same time we are going to continue to invest where we can expand our competitive position. Our management is ready to meet the challenge in this coming year.  Let me just once again reiterate what I think has been a very successful strategy for us of protecting our strong U.S. market position and investing in and growing our international operations. It has been successful in the past and I believe it will be successful going forward. I want to thank all of our employees for their significant efforts in 2008 and we look forward to 2009.  So let’s now go ahead and open it up for questions. 
 :
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Dave Anderson – UBS. 
Dave Anderson - UBS: Back in the fall you had talked about the scope of the Manifa project remaining intact with the timing getting stretched out about another year or so. Since then outlook has dimmed considerably. I’m just wondering if you have seen these larger projects continue to get pushed out as the need for capacity expansion, particularly in the OPEC nations, is considerably less now. 
Dave Lesar:  Certainly I can talk specifically about Manifa which has been stretched out and I understand they are looking at some of the E&C contracts and potentially [retendering] them. I think that is a symptom of what we are seeing at a number of the larger projects in the international marketplace. Not a cancellation of existing projects but basically drawing them out over a longer period of time so they don’t have a big slug of production coming on in a weakened oil price environment. What we are seeing is a cancellation of projects that were perhaps about to get tendered and move forward.  So I think our customers right now really are taking a wait and see attitude toward the supply response to pricing especially those customers that are inside OPEC. 
Dave Anderson - UBS: How much longer is that wait? 
Dave Lesar:  Your guess is as good as mine. I think that they are really wanting to see whether this last substantial reduction in OPEC quota will have some result in at least stabilizing prices but I think as we have all seen and read there is a view out there that oil prices need to push back up into the $75 range before OPEC will be satisfied with bringing additional production on. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley. 
Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley: I understand the difficulty in giving any type of forecast given the macro environment that we are in but it seems like the debate is this going to be a steep down cycle that troughs in 2009 or is the trough going to be flatter? What is your view here on when we will see the biggest quarterly year-over-year decline? 
Tim Probert:  I think that let’s just sort of talk about North America first and then talk about the international markets. As far as North America is concerned, as I mentioned earlier, we do see a lot of similarities in terms of the pace and rate of change with the 2001 cycle in which case it would suggest to us we would be kind of looking at a 3-quarter cycle. We are obviously already in the second quarter of that right now. So that is kind of obviously it remains to be seen but we are certainly monitoring closely the performance against that cycle and we certainly see similarities to it in present.  With respect to the international markets obviously the amplitude of change in the international markets has historically been quite different, more muted and over a longer period of time. I think it still remains to be seen at present how that will play out. Our expectations are that it will probably be somewhat similar to past cycles. 
Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley: Another company reported last Friday suggested that they were a little bit surprised by the uniform cuts in activity on a global basis compared to previous cycles. It seems to be declining everywhere and how that could be setting us up for a shorter cycle. Are you seeing something similar? Are you taking market share? What is going on? 
Tim Probert:  I think that certainly there are some very large projects which we are going to bring in some significant production as Dave was just describing. Manifa would be a good example. Clearly they are going to be delayed substantially. Those are going to obviously contribute significantly to the overall supply base. I think that any time you see a short and sharp reduction in activity particularly given the fact that the overall decline curves for liquids do appear to be getting somewhat steeper and if we take the case of Russia, for example, as I mentioned it was a major contributor to non-OPEC production over the last decade clearly turning over somewhat here in 2008 and 2009. We think that shortfalls in investment over any kind of period will get some or provoke some supply response relatively quickly and obviously that impacts pricing directly. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co. 
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co. : You mentioned, Tim, in your comments a 1,200 basis point margin compression and I think you were talking about North America in past cycles, correct? 
Tim Probert:  Correct.  
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co. :  Are you thinking that is somewhat of a maximum here? As you think about all of the differences as well as the similarities of the current environment with past, help us understand how you are thinking about that 1,200 basis point margin compression. 
Tim Probert:  We were trying to be sort of a little helpful by comparing ourselves to past cycles and obviously that has been an experience in past cycles. I think there are some positives that come into play. Obviously the horizontal component is a significant positive. Overall levels of service intensity are clearly a positive as well. There are obviously presumably some negatives in there as well particularly with respect to the uncertainty relating to the economy. But I think in general terms our feeling is our best guess is that we would pursue a path that is very similar to the 2001 downturn. 
Geoff Kieburtz – Weeden & Co. : Could you extend that to the international market? How are you thinking of the international market relative to past cycles? 
Tim Probert:  I think that it is probably too early to say at the present time. 
Dave Lesar:  Let me add the international markets obviously are a longer term contract market. They did not have the swing up in profitability that we saw in the North American markets even in this cycle. Obviously the push down in pricing and margins if it does come will come at a much slower rate than it would in North America because we do have a good supply of contracts that have fixed prices on them that will mitigate some of the downward pressure right now.
Operator:  The next question comes from Michael LaMotte – J.P. Morgan. 
Michael LaMotte – J.P. Morgan: If I could follow-up on the CapEx guidance and in particular try to ferret out what flat means in terms of confidence in expectations for non-North American growth particularly given that you highlighted project related CapEx in technology before replacement in terms of the mix of CapEx. Are we reading too much into it? Can you expand on that a bit? 
Mark McCollum:  I don’t know that the order of the way we mention it is necessarily the way we are thinking about it. What we were trying to do is just try to help you understand why we think that it is going to be not that much dissimilar to the 2008 spend. We along the way had given guidance to our spend in 2008 was to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. As we went through the year we spent a little over $1.8 billion so because we had a number of projects that were coming along the way there is some carry over capital that spills over into the next year.  We manufacture the lions share of our own capital equipment for Sperry, for our pressure pumping business lines and so there is an emphasis always to make sure that our plants are efficient, that we keep those things working to maximize not only the amount of equipment we have out there to take advantage of opportunities but to also get new technologies out there and around the globe as quickly as we can and so as we look at this given some of the guidance that Tim suggested in terms of how we are thinking about the cycle we are continuing to make sure we have the right equipment in the right places throughout the world. We are taking advantage of replacing older equipment. We have a fairly significant percentage, about 25% of our fleet that is over 10 years old and so we are going to be upgrading our equipment to make sure we have the very best quality equipment out there when this market environment begins to turn. 
Michael LaMotte – J.P. Morgan: Will that 25% do you expect to scrap a good bit of that? 
Mark McCollum:  I think there are different ways to look at that. Some of it may be cold stacked for a period of time if that is necessary. We will continue to maintain that if we need to. Some of it may go into other markets like some international markets that have a better environment for some of the used equipment. 
Dave Lesar :  Let me just add to this I think a couple of things that Mark touched on are important points to take away. One, I don’t think a lot of people realize just how intensively everyone’s equipment new and old has been used in this up cycle because of the pinch that was on the service industry’s ability to supply into this marketplace. So equipment was used much more aggressively, much harder and with much higher up times than we have seen in the past and frankly I think there is a lot of equipment throughout the entire service industry that could use an upgrade.  Second of all, as Mark has said, since we have our own plants we have the ability to sort of modify our build rates to suit our own needs and to suit the level of demand that we see up there. Also because of that we are now being able to take advantage of a cheaper input price to a number of our key product lines. The prices for diesel engines, transmissions, for electronic components, all of those things where our vendors had plenty of pricing power with the worldwide economic crisis they don’t have that pricing power. We want to take advantage of some of that and we think that by continuing to build through this down cycle we actually can build more for less than we would have been able to do a year ago.  We also have not been able to catch up to demand for some of the newer technologies that we had brought out especially some of our drilling and logging tools and there still is a very high demand for those high end, high tech, brand new types of products that we have brought out. So we want to continue to invest in those products which are generally going into our international marketplaces. I think the combination of sort of refreshing the fleet of tools that we have and building up the supply in the redundancy in those pieces of technology that still remain in high demand and because we can do all of this cheaper than we would have been able to do a year ago we really believe that as long as we can live within the cash flow we have it really is the best thing to position us to come out of the other end of this thing in a better relative position than we went in. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Alan Laws – Bank of America. 
Alan Laws – Bank of America: I have a couple of questions. One is kind of a high level one and the other one on North America. The first one, is it fair to say that you and your peers are preparing for an extended slow down? Sort of when you look at the changes in the array of indicators and customer discussions versus other periods are there material differences in this one? 
Dave Lesar:  If you look at our customers in three buckets I think we are seeing sort of a different response from each group. Our national oil company customers which are an increasingly larger piece of our total customer base clearly are looking at their cash flows. A lot of their revenue stream that they generate actually goes to fund their host government operations so although they are carefully looking at their spending, I think the announcement from Petrobras this weekend about sort of reaffirming a fairly large capital build going forward is indicative of where the national oil companies will go over time. So I think they are looking at commodity prices. They are slowing things down but we are not seeing a substantial reduction in our business opportunities with the NOC’s.  The IOC’s are having the typical response to lower prices. You are seeing some capital budget reductions, deferral of projects getting started, continuing projects they have going but we have been down that road a number of times with the IOC’s and we are pretty good at sort of ramping our business with them up or down.  I think the one thing that has changed and certainly bears some watching in this marketplace is the big U.S. independents. So many of them were basically funding their cash flows out of leverage and out of borrowing and with the corporate credit window being shut I think we are seeing those customers try to come up with a way to live within their cash flow. However, as Tim has indicated these are the ones that are U.S. gas denominated and I think they will see a supply response, i.e. either production will go down if they don’t continue to at least do some maintenance drilling. So that is the group we see to be the quickest hit and the one where we are seeing the most pressure in terms of our business opportunities with them. I also believe that is the group that as production goes down and their own revenues go down they will have to start to drill so I think we will start to see that group actually respond more quickly.  That is sort of a lay of the land with our general customer base. 
Alan Laws – Bank of America:  You just came off of a record rig count in North America before this large drop and you noted in your comments there is a backlog of completion work to carry you through into 2009 for awhile. How far do you think that will carry you and is there any evidence that producers will just curtail completing these wells altogether? 
Dave Lesar:  I don’t think that once drilled they are not going to complete it. Certainly having sunk cost of the drilling in they are certainly going to complete them at some point in time. Of course you don’t want your well bore stability to deteriorate so you can’t just leave them out there forever. So I think that is going to be the first slug of business opportunity that we see when our customer base decides that the time is right to move forward with bringing these on but I don’t see they are going to be permanently curtailed. 
Tim Probert:  The amount of wells in inventory varies from customer to customer and area to area so it is a bit difficult to sort of give you a really sort of broad generalization. There are a meaningful number in inventory and it will have an impact on two things. Obviously service delivery being one of them. The second being the sort of lag we are going to see between the significant drop off in activity and the overall production response. That is why I think we commented a little earlier in the call that we expected to see some sort of production response show up in Q2. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International: I was struck by the fact that you mentioned Russia and U.K. North Sea as two of the more poorly behaved markets in 2009 but no mention of Venezuela. I was just curious as to what your expectations are for that market. 
Tim Probert:  All indications are that from an overall activity standpoint it clearly is a significant requirement, the services in Venezuela. Clearly absent sort of the major issues with respect to the current environment we have all been reading about I think that we will continue to see some expansion there. 
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International: So you expect Venezuela for Halliburton and industry wide will be up year-over-year in 2009? 
Tim Probert:  2008 was certainly up year-over-year. I think the fundamental requirement is clearly there. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital. 
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: Dave, if you thought that international E&P spending was going to be down 10% in 2009 versus 2008 would you think in that environment number one you could have up international revenue given all the things you have going on? Secondly, in that environment would you think you could maintain margins? 
Dave Lesar:  I don’t obviously have a crystal ball but I think that if you look at the nature of contracting in the international market and the fact that a lot of the spend that will happen is basically on ongoing projects, if in fact spend went down 10% it really would have to be reduction on the front end of projects that had been considered to get started in 2009 and that typically would mean a reduction in exploration drilling. Obviously exploration although we have good products and good technologies there we really draw more of our revenue stream off of the completion and production side of the cycle. So I think to answer your question it is yes, we could grow our international revenue in 2009 even with a 10% reduction in capital expenditures in that year. 
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: Industry wide, not with Halliburton strategy, but industry wide in the U.S. how far would you expect and you can use a range U.S. stimulation prices to come down both on a contract basis and a spot basis from where they were in the third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2008? 
Tim Probert:  I think we provided a little bit of a guidance earlier about our expectations regarding price cycles using them as models for the current cycle. I think what we can say also is that our experience has been that we clearly see a significant portion of that shortfall which we described as 1,200 basis points, we historically have seen a significant portion of that occur in the early part of the down cycle so that perhaps provides you a little indicator there. I’m afraid it is really not possible for us to provide you any detailed expectations here in the present time. 
Dave Lesar:  I think that obviously the question mark is where does the rig count end up dropping to and the only thing we can use past down turns to judge from is with the benefit of hind sight knowing what the rig count did from top to bottom and then looking back for some sort of correlation. I think right now the question is where is the rig count going to sort of bottom out and I know that even within the group on this call there is a wide variety of conclusions around that. I think the points that we want you to take away are one; we have a strong position in the U.S. We have the strongest position in stimulation. A lot of rigs that have fallen off so far have been those commodity type rigs drilling in conventional areas for customers that we did not work for anyway. I think that with our differentiated technologies we really do believe we can out perform the market. The question is what is the market going to be. I think the other point that Tim made is an important one. If you look back historically most of the fall off in pricing basically happens in the first quarter or so and then sort of pricing finds a bottom and gets stabilized and sort of creeps back or tends to creep back from that point.  As I said, we are going to protect our market share. We typically grow our market share in these kinds of markets and I just don’t see any reason why that is not going to happen again. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering & Co. 
Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering & Co. : Could you talk a little bit about obviously this is a fluid market place and how long do we sort of watch the commodity price environment before actions get more stringent whether that means a slower CapEx number or more aggressive cost cutting measures? What is sort of the timing of making decisions around more significant action? 
Dave Lesar:  I think it really goes back to we can watch commodity prices. We can watch the rig count but the one thing we absolutely have control over and can watch is our cash flow. So those will be inputs to the amount of cash flow we can go ahead and generate and whatever the market hands to us. It is going to be within that free cash flow that we make our decisions around additional cost cuts or trimming back the capital budget. Since we can watch our cash flow almost on a daily basis I would say that we can make that decision on a real time basis. 
Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering & Co. : In an environment where things are slowing last year we took a run at a big acquisition. Do you think acquisition opportunities are going to emerge and where do they fall on your level of interest relative to organic capital spending and share repurchase and the like? 
Dave Lesar:  I think clearly there are some M&A targets out there that look more attractive at the pricing we are seeing in the market today. I think up until the last 30 days or so I think the expectations of value versus what the market was putting on in terms of value there has been a huge disconnect. I think to some extent that emotional disconnect is starting to contract a bit. But I think that as we have said as long as we continue to see growth opportunities within our ability to grow organically that would be the safest and I think most prudent direction to go.  If we do see market opportunity to add to our portfolio in a way we think would add some long-term value and we think we could pick it up on a basis that makes sense we clearly would take a look at it. We certainly have our radar up and working but I think that it is really now that sort of the emotional view of value is now starting to equal what the market place is putting on in value. So those discussions may accelerate and they may go nowhere at this point. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Mike Irvin – Deutsche Bank. 
Mike Irvin – Deutsche Bank : I realize you can’t speak specifically to the SPCA settlement but more broadly regarding the indemnification with KBR could you remind us kind of the scope and the timing of that? For instance, is there any other potential liabilities out there we should be aware of? I know KBR unfortunately has been in the news again recently with some potential issues on their work. Again, I’m just wondering if there are any taps, the time frame of that and any other things that are on the radar screen? 
Mike McCollum :  I’m sorry but we are not going to take any questions regarding the KBR and the indemnification there. What I encourage you to do is go back and look at the third quarter 10-Q which discusses the indemnity and that gives you the specifics about what is left out there. We don’t really have any other update on timing or other issues.
Operator:  The next question comes from Waqar Syed – Tristone Capital. 
Waqar Syed – Tristone Capital : My question is on continental Europe there are some reports that activity in continental Europe may be up this year and in coming years. My question is how are you positioned there visa vie your competition there to capture incremental business there? My second question relates to share buy backs. You had no share buybacks in the fourth quarter. What will make you change your stature regarding that in 2009? 
Tim Probert:  I’ll take the first part and then Mark will comment on the share buybacks. With respect to continental Europe you are absolutely correct. It has been a particularly active area for us in 2008. We feel we are very well positioned throughout continental Europe and Eastern Europe and we do expect to see a continuation of activity both in terms of sort of gas activity, storage activity and we expect to see that continue. 
Dave Lesar:  One of the advantages of that marketplace is that we [inaudible] plays very well into some of our strong suit. It is directional drilling. It is cracking. It is completions. As Tim has said that is an area that we have been particularly pleased with sort of the direction that market is going. That is one of those markets we are investing in and have invested in 2008 and into 2009.  With respect to the question on the share buyback, obviously we were in active negotiations with government officials in Q4 and therefore could not get back into market to purchase our shares back. Obviously with the announcement today and hopefully the prospective conclusion of this effort once we get that behind us obviously that is something we will take a look at. 
Operator:  The next question comes from Robin Shoemaker – Citigroup. 
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: I wanted to pursue a little bit your comment about the restrained nature of your workforce reduction that is ongoing and fully appreciate that in the last two downturns you kind of had a v-shaped bottom and you had a recovering market relatively soon after hitting the bottom of the rig count slide. At what point might you decide that this time might be a different scenario where we stay at a relatively low level of drilling for awhile? I’m sure you have a plan B with regard to this restraint but it obviously has earnings implications for the near-term and I just wonder what time frame you are thinking about to make a decision about the recovery of the market. 
Dave Lesar:  Just to reiterate, the strategy we have is basically to minimize the reductions because if you look at the severance cost, rehiring costs and retraining costs of an employee base to handle an upside it almost always is more than or at least equal to the cost of carrying that employee base through a rather sharp downturn. So I would say that what we will do is we will probably want to go a couple of quarters into this year, albeit maybe carrying a few more people than people would think. It is always one of these hindsight kinds of decisions. You look back and say well you should have kept more or you should have cut more people. My view is that we will probably wait until the end of the second quarter, size up market at that point in time and then see whether any further actions are necessary. 
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: In terms of living within your cash flow in terms of capital spending, if the consensus earnings estimate for Halliburton is anywhere near correct you would have and given also your $900 million of DD&A you would have quite a bit more cash flow than your $1.8 billion CapEx budget and yet you are indicating you may cut CapEx if the earnings decline. So to the extent you have free cash flow, an acquisition would be first priority and then potentially share repurchases. Is that correct? 
Dave Lesar:  I wouldn’t say that acquisition is first and share repurchase is second. I think they are not mutually exclusive but we certainly would have the ability to look at both of those and weigh them in the balance. You are absolutely right. We are going to live within our cash flow but we expect to be able to spend capital at the level that we indicated to you and still be well within the cash flow we have. 
Christian Garcia:  That will do it. Thank you for participating in the call. 
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today’s conference. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.

Operator:  Welcome to your Halliburton third quarter 2008 earnings call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Christian Garcia, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Christian Garcia:  Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for seven days. A podcast download will also be available. The press release announcing the third quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO, Mark McCollum, CFO, and Tim Probert, Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development. In today's call Dave will provide opening remarks, Mark will discuss our overall financial performance and liquidity position, and Tim will provide comments on our operations and business outlook. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. Before turning the call over to Dave, I'd like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, and recent current reports on Form 8-K.  Please note that we will be using the term international to refer to our operations outside the U.S. and Canada, and we will refer to the combination of U.S. and Canada as North America.  Now I'll turn the call over to Dave Lesar. 
Dave Lesar:  In the third quarter the stock and commodity markets saw unprecedented volatility which, of course, has been very unsettling to investors. Amidst all this, we have remained very focused on delivering solid growth and returns while executing on our strategy of balancing our portfolio both geographically and by product service line. I'm happy to share with your our third quarter results today. Third quarter operating income reached a new milestone with over $1 billion generated for the first time in operating income. All of our product service lines had record revenues. The company posted year-over-year revenue growth of 24%, with our International business registering growth of 25%. Latin America continued its momentum, with 42% revenue growth over prior years, and International margins of 22% exceeded our stated target. Currently we've not experienced any business impact from the equity and credit market volatility, and despite the growing prospects of a global economic slowdown and related decrease in hydrocarbon demand, we continue to believe in the long-term fundamentals of the oil and gas industry. We expect that any major macroeconomic disruptions will ultimately correct themselves as the underlying trends of smaller and more complex accumulations, higher depletion rates, and a need for continued reserve replacement will drive the long-term demand for our services.  We remain committed to investing in technology and appropriate levels of capital and infrastructure to ensure we align ourselves with the industry's long-term growth trajectory. Let me now turn to the results of North America and discuss our prospects for the remainder of the year and onward. North America revenue for the quarter grew a solid 13% sequentially despite the hurricane disruptions. We have previously stated that the shift toward new emerging plays will benefit our differentiated technologies, and we started to see evidence of this in the third quarter. Our U.S. Land operations showed strong sequential growth of 13%, as it benefited from the higher technical requirements needed to unlock the value of these new resource plays. For instance, Sperry's revenue growth of 16% sequentially resulted from good penetration of our MWD and LWD technologies.  North American margins of 25% reflect strong performance in U.S. Land due to higher activity and the success of our surcharge program. The uptick in margin performance in U.S. Land overcame the impact of the hurricane and the two gains recognized on the sale of assets in the second quarter, resulting in flat North American margins sequentially. The drop in natural gas prices is creating uncertainty on future activity levels, and it's caused some of our E&P customers to adjust the level of the capital expenditures. Despite this, we see secular trends in the market could provide us with unique opportunities.  First, as operators make modifications to their drilling plans, their capital expenditure cuts appear to be directed primarily towards conventional and shallower drilling activities, preserving their focus on unconventional plays where we have a stronger position. This can translate to a more favorable business mix for us, utilizing our services and technology intensive offerings.  Second, access to capital may constrain the growth of service industry capacity. The inability of some service providers to raise capital to lead to a tightening of supply and this, along with favorable activity mix, creates the opportunity for market share gains in a constrained activity environment. And third, our strategy of aligning our people and equipment to the largest players in North America should temper the impact of a slowdown to our business while production levels adjust to balance the supply and demand relationship. A significant portion of our revenues in North America consists of large independents and international oil companies. These large independents and IOCs tend to have longer drilling plans and they're not as vulnerable as private E&Ps for the short-term fluctuations in the commodity markets. If we have spare capacity available we will then be able to serve other customers in the market.  And finally, we believe that the natural gas market has been and will continue to be self-correcting. These trends may not entirely counteract the effects of a slowdown in activity, however we think we're in a good position to handle any operational downturn and we will use this environment to strengthen the long-term health of our U.S. franchise. Turning to our International business, revenue continues its upward momentum, with 25% year-over-year growth led by Latin America growing by more than 40%. All of our key markets in Latin America have grown substantially, but most notable is Brazil, where we experienced year-over-year growth of 70% in the third quarter. We have seen higher utilization of our reservoir evaluation and sand control technologies and expect to see continued growth in this market as we assist Petrobras and other IOCs in their deepwater projects. Sequentially, International revenues and operating income were up 4% and 5%, respectively, as all regions except Europe/Africa saw a good flow through from increased revenue. Europe/Africa operating income was down 6% sequentially as some contracts in the North Sea have expired and we are currently redeploying equipment and personnel to [break in audio] locations. Additionally, we experienced increased operational costs and an unfavorable business mix in West Africa. International margins for the quarter were 22%. As we mentioned in previous calls, we will see regional fluctuations between quarters depending on where projects are mobilized and started. Our International business has not yet experienced the impact of the weakening global economy or the decline in commodity prices. At this time, barring a significant or prolonged global recession, we expect that our International growth will continue, perhaps albeit at a slower rate than 2008. Now let me turn the call over to Mark, who'll provide more details on our financial performance.
Mark McCollum:  I'll begin with our operational highlights and I'll be comparing our third quarter results sequentially to the second quarter.  Our revenue in the third quarter was $4.9 billion, up $366 million or 8% from the second quarter, led by Production Enhancement, which registered growth of 15%. On a geographic basis, North America led all regions with 13% growth driven by higher activity in U.S. Land and a seasonal recovery in Canada. This was partially offset by a decline in the Gulf of Mexico due to the hurricanes.  Operating income increased $102 million or 11% from the second quarter of 2008, representing incremental margins of 28%. Our third quarter results included a $22 million WellDynamics acquisition-related charge which was included in Corporate and Other. Our second quarter results included a $25 million gain on the sale of two investments which was recognized in North America in the Drilling and Evaluation segment and a charge of $30 million for the settlement of the ReedHycalog patent dispute, which was included in Corporate and Other. Now I'll highlight the segment results: Completion and Production revenue increased $227 million or 9% from the second quarter, while operating income increased $99 million or 18%. The higher revenue was led by Production Enhancement, driven by increased activity in U.S. Land, the seasonal recovery in Canada from spring breakup, and completions activity in Brazil. Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis, North America Completion and Production revenue increased 15% due to strong activity for U.S. Land in Canada, partially offset by decreased revenue in the Gulf of Mexico due to the hurricanes. Operating income was up 28% due to better fleet utilization in U.S. Land and Canada.  Third quarter operating income also reflected the benefit of successfully negotiating fuel surcharges in the second quarter, which contributed approximately 70 basis points in sequential margin improvement. These surcharges are generally billed on a one-quarter lag and reflect the higher fuel costs we experienced in the second quarter. Since fuel costs have moderated in the third quarter, we don't expect as much impact on margins in the fourth quarter.  Also, as we've seen in previous years, we expect activity will decline in the fourth quarter due to environmental stipulations in the Rockies and the extended holiday weekends. In Latin America, Completion and Production revenue increased 16% in the third quarter due to strong activity in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. We experienced increased demand for completions and sand control systems across all areas of the region, but most notably in Brazil, where we've seen good application of our completions technologies in deepwater activity. In the Europe/Africa CIS region, Completion and Production revenue increased 2% and operating income was flat compared to second quarter levels. Strong activity in the Caspian and higher vessel utilization and pipeline processing activity in the North Sea were offset by the absence of a favorable pricing adjustment recognized in the second quarter in West Africa. In addition, we experienced higher completion tool sales in Libya. In Middle East/Asia, Completion and Production posted a sequential revenue decrease of 4% as decreased regional cementing activity and lower completion tool sales were partially offset by higher Production Enhancement activity in Australia and in India. Despite lower revenue, the segment had an increase in operating income of 2% due to a favorable mix in completion tools. Now turning to our Drilling and Evaluation segment, revenue increased $139 million or 7%, with strong sequential revenue growth in all product service lines. Operating income, however, declined by 2% due to the impact from hurricane disruptions and the gains we recognized last quarter from the sale of two investments. Further, the second quarter for D&E was also favorably impacted by a pricing adjustment in West Africa. In North America, Drilling and Evaluation revenue increased 9%, led by Sperry with sequential growth of 16% as this product line continues to benefit from the trend of increased horizontal drilling. Further, all product lines benefited from the seasonal recovery in Canada. Operating income for the quarter decreased 12% due to the impact of the hurricane disruptions and the gain on the asset sales last quarter. D&E's Latin America revenue increased 2%, driven by increased utilization of MWD, LWD technologies by Petrobras for their deepwater projects. Additionally, we saw strong demand for our fluid services in Venezuela this quarter. These increases were partially offset by lower drilling activity in Northern Mexico due to weather-related issues and lower efficiencies delivering [civil] works on well locations. This lower activity, along with unfavorable mix for Sperry in Ecuador, resulted in D&E's Latin America operating income being down 9%. With regard to the Alliance II project in Southern Mexico, we are currently operating on seven PEMEX-supplied rigs, but right now we anticipate no additional rigs for the remainder of the project.  In the Europe/Africa region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue increased 1% while operating income declined 10%. As mentioned, the second quarter included a favorable pricing adjustment in West Africa which impacted the comparisons between the quarters. In addition, we had weaker results in the North Sea and we'll be redeploying equipment to other locations. A highlight for this region is the continued growth of directional drilling technologies in Russia. For the third quarter, Sperry in Russia grew 31% from the prior year.  Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income in the Middle East/Asia region grew 14% and 29%, respectively. The increase was driven by higher activity in Sperry across the region, with sequential revenue growth of 22%. Additionally, we experienced strong wireline and baroid revenues in Asia. Now I'll address some additional financial items. As you know, we've worked very hard to reduce our leverage and improve our liquidity and credit profile in recent years. We currently have $2.8 billion of debt outstanding, down from $3.9 billion at the end of 2004. Our debttototalcapital ratio stands at 27%, down from 50% at year end 2004. We have an undrawn $1.2 billion revolving credit facility that extends to July 2012, and we just entered into an additional six-month revolving credit facility on similar terms that adds another $400 million of credit capacity should we need it to fund operations. The convertible bonds outstanding at the end of the second quarter, which represented an approximately $2.7 billion total liability, has been extinguished. We were able to pay it off in the third quarter with a combination of cash on hand, the issuance of treasury stock, and the proceeds from a new $1.2 billion bond offering during the early part of September before the credit markets became difficult. While we took an accounting charge of $693 million, representing the cash portion of the premium paid, this transaction had the impact of reducing our fully diluted share count by approximately 15 million shares. At September 30, 2008 we held $973 million of cash and cash equivalents. We manage our cash investments conservatively and are currently investing principally in U.S. Treasury securities and repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasuries. We suffered no losses to date in our cash investment portfolio despite meltdowns in several sectors of the money markets. The effective tax rate for continuing operations was 106% for the third quarter of 2008. Excluding the non-tax deductible loss of $693 million on the note redemption, the effective tax rate was slightly above the guidance we provided in the second quarter. The sequential increase in the tax rate was driven by higher relative earnings from the United States versus foreign subsidiaries this quarter. We expect our fourth quarter 2008 effective tax rate to return to the 30% to 32% range. We expect our depreciation, depletion and amortization will continue to average approximately $190 million for the fourth quarter.  And finally, we're marginally lowering our capital expenditures guidance for full year 2008 to $1.8 to $1.9 billion due largely to the temporary shutdown of manufacturing in our Houston area plants because of the hurricane that directly hit the city. 
Tim Probert:  Dave provided commentary on our strong quarter [break in audio] in North America, and I would like to add some thoughts on this because it has important implications for our business in 2009. He noted the natural gas supply/demand balance has been exacerbated by the credit crunch and will lead to drilling activity below current levels in 2009. Here, the ongoing shift from conventional to unconventional drilling will continue to influence Halliburton's business. Service intensity for our stimulation business expresses revenue per well has grown 15% annually since the first quarter of 2006 as the activity mix has changed towards these more [break in audio] wells.  Also, horizontally directed rigs have increased to roughly 30% of total rigs active in the U.S. in response to their use to develop these shale resources. These wells translate to a service intensity of between two and five times greater than those of a conventional vertical well.  Technology continues to be a significant differentiator. This quarter we closed the acquisition of Pinnacle Technologies from CARBO Ceramics, and are pleased to welcome the 150 or so Pinnacle professionals to the organization. Pinnacle's stimulation monitoring and analysis services minimize fracturing uncertainty, rapidly verify [inaudible], and optimize reservoir drainage.  Pinnacle is also a catalyst for our VeriStim service, a key workflow of our digital asset, which combines microseismic monitoring with distributed temperature sensing and a variety of post-well tools to deliver the most effective hydrocarbon recovery from the asset. In summary, we expect differentiated technology and this strong service intensity trend to provide a favorable overlay for Halliburton on reduced 2009 North America rig count.  For our International business, while macroeconomic uncertainties cloud our view at this point, we still believe growth will continue in the fourth quarter and in 2009, but at a lower rate than that which we have experienced in the first three quarters of 2008. As our International customers prioritize their activities, it's likely we may experience delay or curtailing of some new projects, notably new heavy oil and potentially some GTL projects. We may also see a slightly increased orientation away from exploration and towards production and development projects as 2009 unfolds.
Dave Lesar: Let me finish up by just saying that we had another solid quarter, strong revenue and margin growth. However, the global events that have transpired in the last few weeks have produced an environment of uncertainty.  However, in North America we believe our customer concentration, differentiated technologies, and position in more service-intensive assets should enable us to manage our way through any reduction in overall activity. Internationally, we continue to expect growth as we leverage our worldwide infrastructure, but perhaps at a slower rate than 2008. Long-term, we continue to believe that the fundamental trends in this industry will favor our company's expertise in well construction and production technologies. I want to thank all of our 55,000 plus employees for their achievements this quarter. Let's go ahead now and open it up for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch.
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch:  You made some comments around looking longer term for what remains really a pretty attractive oil service horizon. Can you give us your early thoughts on Capex in 2009 given the developing backdrop? Schlumberger noted, kind of looking at it, maybe cutting in the second half and Weatherford cut theirs this morning. Is there any opportunity if you were to keep it higher to gain share?
Tim Probert: With respect to capital spending, as Mark mentioned, it's going to be slightly lower than we had previously forecast for 2008, and we're obviously monitoring it very closely as we move into 2009. The key issue for us is essentially the lead time that's associated with the manufacture of our capital equipment, and that actually has shrunk a little bit from actually close to a year approximately six to nine months ago to a sort of three-month to nine-month timeframe depending on the product itself. So that gives us the ability to respond appropriately for the circumstances as they arise.
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: So you're more nimble and efficient now in your manufacturing side?
Tim Probert: I think, yes. I think as you probably know, we've invested in international supply chains, which have given us the opportunity to essentially shorten our supply lines and give us a little bit more flexibility in response to emerging market conditions. 
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: Would those be the areas that would be most vulnerable if the slowdown were to get more severe?
Tim Probert: The International markets? No, I think on the contrary. I think, you know, traditionally the international projects that we see are longer term, they're larger, and they tend not to be disrupted in the same way that we see the sort of rapid volatility in the U.S. gas market.
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: You said in the release that most International projects are okay at current oil prices, kind of a qualified statement. What or where are you seeing projects potentially at risk? So longer term or like a nearer term issue?
Tim Probert: Well, the issue is always really sort of the cost of the marginal barrel. And the marginal barrel really sort of revolves primarily around obviously high cost elements of production. And a good example of that would be new heavy oil projects, which obviously are going to be very challenged at prices that are sort of probably much below about $75.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley.
Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley:  You mentioned credit constraints with respect to potential stock ups in North America. There's been an army of smaller - I think they're pressure pumping entrants. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that market unfolding and whether we could see some consolidation or some companies fail in their expansion ambitions?
Mark McCollum: Well, you know, I guess our comments are directly related to what we've seen in the press, just like you have. There are some of our customers who have been adjusting their capital plans going forward based on their individual credit situations and liquidity. We expect that possibly that may persist and there may be others that could come in, but as we currently look at it, obviously it's difficult to say what people may do in the market, you know, with stock prices low, when everybody is sort of focusing on making sure that their liquidity positions are very strong. What we do know about the North American market is that it has the ability to turn very rapidly, and if people adjust their capital plans down and production falls with it, that the market may self-correct very quickly and we could find ourselves back in the game within a very short time period.
Dave Lesar: Yes, I think with respect to the service contractors that are out there, especially those that were privately financed that came into the pressure pumping markets, we believe that a downturn in North America markets will put pressure on their financial results and it's unlikely to attract the sort of additional equity necessary to continue to expand their fleets. And I think to answer your question, perhaps there will be opportunities for consolidation among that group.
Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley: When it comes to the International potential slowdown, what areas should we focus on, beyond exploration which is sort of [inaudible]. But what product lines? Are there any product lines that could - we had another oil services company express some grave concerns about the impact on the sustainability of the global oil production base if we were to see Capex cuts. Could you talk a little bit about what your views are on that, what region you could see some slowdown, what product lines and what production implications that might have down the road?
Tim Probert: If I could answer that question two ways, Ole, just first of all I think on the global supply/demand situation with respect to liquid hydrocarbons, you know, oil, essentially, I think we feel very positive about the long-term view because there really is still a pretty good tightness, really, between supply and demand given the fact that we really are in an era of quite significant acceleration in decline curves. And we think that this bears some close scrutiny and we really feel that for the long term this looks a very positive arena for our company and for the service industry in general. Specifically with respect to particular product lines, I think that we've got a very good portfolio for the markets that we see going forward. We probably see, as you mentioned, these sort of obvious declines somewhat in exploration activities. And as you know, we really are not heavily involved in sort of broad seismic acquisition and that's not an area that really impacts us. But we don't really see any particular areas within our portfolio that would be particularly a risk, I think, to the current environment internationally.
Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley: So with respect to Mexico or U.K. North Sea or Russia, you don't see any particular risk in any of those markets?
Tim Probert: Well I think, as we mentioned before, that's where the cost of the marginal barrel is higher, so that's where the biggest risks are in place. And so by type of hydrocarbon, I guess I would say heavy oil is probably at greatest risk for new projects which are under way. And, you know, those are projects which frankly we really hadn't expected to see come fully on stream until sort of 2014, 2015. But we will need that production by that time, we feel, and that obviously, if it's not there, then it means it puts more pressure on conventional production. That's point number one. And point number two is there are certain basins and probably the U.K. sector of the North Sea would be a good example of where we would expect to see perhaps a little more challenging environment than we've historically seen with high oil prices.
Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley: And then just finally, how flexible do you think you are in your organization in order to ride out what could come your way?
Tim Probert: I think we're very flexible. I mean, we've got sort of a very geographically focused organization internationally and we're already in the process, in fact, of moving some equipment out of parts of the North Sea into other areas where we can utilize it more effectively in anticipation of some changes in that environment.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital.
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital:  At this time would you think your annual renewals in U.S. pressure pumping would be up, down, flat or do you think the customers will want to defer decisions?
Dave Lesar: I think we actually were out in the Rockies earlier last week, and I think right now the discussions we're having generally with customers is to just renew with some negotiation the contracts that we have with them at this point in time. We don't see the sort of orgy of re-bidding that we saw this time a year ago.
Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital: Okay, so that should be fine with you, right, because you think that you'll continue your strategy of pushing through all cost increases on them?
Dave Lesar: We would hope to, sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dave Anderson - UBS.
Dave Anderson - UBS:  I guess just going down the line of the Capex reductions we're hearing out there, it seems like most of the comments have been coming out of the small guys. I'm just wondering if you could just kind of talk specifically about your customers, about how they're reacting, I guess specifically comparing the integrated to large cap E&Ps versus the smaller E&Ps, and I guess also the private operators, which I suspect you have many fewer customers.  I guess, in other words, with the exception of a few, it seems this is kind of isolated to one certain area. Am I correct in that assumption or are you seeing it in other areas and it just hasn't materialized yet? 
Tim Probert: Dave, there's been about 10 companies which have come out and sort of made some significant modifications to their 2009 capital spending, and that's primarily been sort of focused on North America, of course. TNK-BP did also come out and make some adjustments, about a 9% reduction in their planned spending for 2009, but primarily focused in the U.S. to this point.
Dave Anderson - UBS: And then if we could, I guess, take another follow up question on the capacity issue, I guess if you look at the [Spears] numbers, it looks like smaller players contributed about twothirds of the capacity the last couple of years. Is it fair to say in light of your comments so far you can safely see single-digit capacity expansion, pressure pumping and the like, for next year?
Tim Probert: Very hard to predict exactly what that may look like. I think I'd just sort of perhaps draw your attention to the point that I made a little earlier, and that is that there still is a lead time obviously for new equipment which is being committed to a particular market. That sort of seems to, for us at least, be between three to nine months, and so one can assume that orders that were placed perhaps six months ago may still find their way into the market unless there is some other reason for them not to do so.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Smith - J.P. Morgan.
David Smith - J.P. Morgan:  First, regarding the redeployment of capital out of the North Sea, how much of that is high grading versus anticipation of a weaker market?
Tim Probert: We're constantly sort of looking at our capital allocation and making sure that we allocate our capital in the most appropriate way for our shareholders. So I think that's a given. But we definitely do see a slightly, for us, at least, a slightly weaker environment which would prompt that activity for us.
David Smith - J.P. Morgan: And also sorry if I missed this, but can you provide a rough split between C&P and D&E of the $33 million impact from the hurricanes?
Mark McCollum: Why not let us come back to you on that? We'll need to look that up. We haven't publicly provided that yet.
Operator: Your next question comes from Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs.
Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs:  You've been through a number of these natural gas cycles many times before. Can you talk us through some of the lessons you learned from the past down cycles or slowdowns in activity and kind of how that factors into how you're strategically preparing for this one in North America right now?
Dave Lesar: I think there's two or three lessons we've learned, and I think we've actually unfortunately gotten pretty good at this. One is that it's critical that you are aligned with the major players that are going to at least keep some of their rigs up and going as you go through one of these cycles. And I think that, as we indicated earlier, our customer base tends to be the IOCs and the larger independents, so I think one, we have a customer base that we want to have. Two is basin knowledge. We have concentrated our efforts with those customers in making sure that we understand the basins that we operate in and therefore make it very difficult for those customers to switch away from Halliburton because of the inherent knowledge and history we have of those locations. Thirdly, I think, is that these things can turn very quickly up and down, and basically to make sure that you keep your cost structure as variable as possible and don't get yourself into a big fixed cost position.  And I think that the last would be that we generally actually gain market share in a downturn, and I suspect that that may happen in this type of a situation because at this point in time our equipment is still sold out every day. And we have customers that are coming to us that some of these smaller providers that don't have the technology are currently assisting and are asking us to do their work. So even if we do have some downturn among our existing customer base, there is built-in demand out there from other customers that we are currently not serving that we could go to.  And so that's why I think we feel pretty confident that we could weather any up and down as well as anyone can.
Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs: Are there some shorter-term actions that you can take right now? And then is there like more of a medium-term plan if this kind of slowdown in activity lasts maybe more than just a couple of quarters? Maybe you can just give us a sense of how long you're kind of positioning yourself for this slowdown activity to take place and what you would maybe need to do if it lasts longer than you expect.
Tim Probert: Clearly, operationally one has to have a plan, a contingency plan in place to deal with that eventuality. And clearly, for us, that revolves around making sure that we have a good handle on our costs, that we're deferring any kind of unnecessary spending that can be deferred, and that we adjust the overall profile of our recruitment to ensure that we're balanced. As you probably know, we've added some 14,000 people on board during the course of the last 12 months, and so we have a large intake of employees which needs to be adjusted to address the realities of the forward market.
Mark McCollum: The other side of that also, from a financial side, we're very focused on cash flow, our working capital, you know, managing our working capital effectively so that we don't let that get away from us. Our current working capital statistics are, in our view, at the top of the peer group, and we intend to make sure that they stay that way. By the way, I was going to answer the question that was asked earlier about the hurricane impact on D&E and C&P. For Drilling and Evaluation, the revenue impact from the hurricanes was $40 million and the operating income impact was $27 million. For the Completion and Production division, the revenue impact was $34 million and the operating income impact was $25 million.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International:  A question with regard to contemplating possibilities and that is, in the event of a reasonably consequential contraction in drilling activity next year - pick a number, call it 300 to 500 rigs do margins get as weak as they did in 2001 and 2002 and, if not, why?
Tim Probert: I think it's kind of helpful to sort of split the thought process up here, Bill, and get it into a couple of areas. And then first of all, I think it's appropriate for us to talk perhaps about oil and secondly maybe we can talk about gas.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Great.
Tim Probert: Firstly, for oil, we've seen pretty healthy growth in all directed activity, running a little over 400 rigs is the total right now. That's about 22%, I think, in total rig count. So it seems to us that unless we see a real collapse in liquids pricing, we could continue to see activity hold around that level. By the way, Halliburton has a real strong position in oil, particularly so, in pressure pumping in North America.  Now for gas, rigs peaked in Q3 at around 1,606 rigs or thereabouts, I think. And with the huge discount that the U.S. gas trades relative to European and Asian supply, it seems to us that, as a result of that there really are a couple of questions. You know, how quickly do we get a demand/supply balance back in place in North America? As a result of that, how many rigs need to come out and do the new shale plays such as the Haynesville, etc., really have a big impact on that and our ability to get back to balance. So a couple of thoughts for you. You know, obviously new gas wells decline very quickly, well over 65% in the U.S. And while we will see some rig count reduction, the supply becomes meaningfully impacted relatively quickly. And I don't think we can predict how many rigs are going to come out. You know, is it 100, 200, or is it more? I don't think we know that. But the fact of the matter is I think we do believe this is a self-correcting mechanism. And also, as Dave mentioned earlier and I mentioned in my comments, we're in quite a different situation here with respect to the sort of flight to quality here with respect to a number of these assets. That flight to quality really does provide us with some sort of favorable overlay.  So I can't predict what the margins are going to do, but I think what we can say is that we see this cycle as being a little different than those that we may historically seen in the past.
Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International: Which I would concur with, but I also reference the comment that you made earlier, roughly 10 E&P companies out with their budgets - and of course those are fluid, as we know, because, if you get a cold winter and stronger gas prices, spending will be better - but thus far their '09 budgets look to be 10% to 45% lower year-over-year versus '08 spending. So for the moment it looks lower. By how much, time will tell. The second question is with regard to Mexico and bidding on the subsequent Chicontepec projects. Hearing that PEMEX is looking for concessions on receivables, for example, from suppliers, I'm wondering if you could just sort of illuminate the whole bidding process with regard to substantial Chicontepec projects and are they asking for any concessions and, if yes, how do you respond to those?
Tim Probert: Yes, Bill. To the best of our knowledge, these projects look like they're going to be delayed. And, you know, what the profile of those projects will be when they sort of reemerge I think is clearly a question. So probably best for us to defer answering that until we've got a better view of what those packages may look like.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering & Co. Securities.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering & Co. Securities:  Could you talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking about your balance sheet and share repurchase? Should we think about that as kind of living within free cash flow and wanting to maintain kind of the billion dollars that you have on hand for flexibility? Kind of how are you thinking about that?
Mark McCollum: You know, we did a little share repurchase in the third quarter, about $120 million, 3.5 million shares on top of the impact of the share reduction that happened as a result of the refinancing, the redemption and refinancing of the convertible bond. But that was all sort of before the credit markets got disrupted.  So we've got maybe about $1.8 billion of authorization left, but today, you know, in this environment, we're sort of operating by keeping our powder dry. You know, we think, just to say it another way, cash is king and it's important to make sure that we're maintaining our liquidity until we have a better view about where the market is going and if there is a downturn, how prolonged that downturn might be.  And at some point, when we feel that we've got a better view of that, then we'll reconsider going back into the market to repurchase shares.
Jeff Tillery - Tudor Pickering & Co. Securities: And my follow up question, unrelated, you guys talked earlier about prospective '09 capital expenditure plans. Could you help us out in terms of how you're thinking about '09 International infrastructure costs? So just trying to dial in or understand a little bit better, depending on what the revenue growth profile looks like, how much your fixed costs are growing internationally, kind of aside from just the typical equipment pieces.
Tim Probert: Yes, obviously, as we mentioned before, monitoring the potential for 2009 capital very closely. But one this is for sure. It is our objective to continue to drive balance in our operations globally, and so we will continue to invest in our international markets to sort of drive long-term growth. We have a strong feeling that the international markets, particularly the international oil markets, are a good long-term opportunity for the company.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup.
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup:  I wanted to ask about - again, going back to the International revised growth outlook - you've had for the last two years very steady kind of year-on-year revenue growth of around 25%. And with the things you're talking about - slowing down heavy oil, gas to liquids projects; a little more development than exploration in the business mix - do you see a meaningful decline in that rate that you've sustained now for two years? And if I may also ask about the margins, which have been very consistently in the 20% to 22% range each quarter going back a couple of years for International, how much impact could you see there with the slowdown you see in International revenue growth?
Tim Probert: To sort of answer the first part of the question, I think it's really perhaps a little too earlier to say at the present time as we look forward. Our customers clearly are going to go through an analysis of their projects and reprioritize those, so it's really too early for us to say.  However, it continues to be our objective, as we've stated, our objective, that is, to drive our markets forward internationally in the 20% range. Now it remains to be seen whether or not the market will cooperate with us on that, but that continues to be our overall objective. With respect to margins, I think it's just too early to say at the present time what the margin outlook might be.
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: If I may ask just one follow up, the acquisition market, could you describe what you might be looking for there? Now you mentioned that you're probably going to hold off on share repurchases. Does that also mean that conserving cash would lead you to hold off on pursuing any acquisition opportunities, even in an environment where you may see some very attractive acquisition opportunities that would give you growth in the international markets?
Tim Probert: Yes, I'll just sort of comment on our overall strategy and I'll let Mark perhaps follow up on that comment. But, I mean, I just really, really want to reiterate our overall strategy.  We're very focused from an acquisition standpoint on really two key elements, you know, those opportunities which provide us some technological opportunity to either expand an existing product offering or to fill a gap, and also geographically, where it may make sense for us to add some acquisitions. And that's obviously within the scope of the allowables, if you like, within our balance sheet.
Mark McCollum: Well and I think, as you pointed out, obviously preserving cash, keeping liquidity strength is an important aspect of what we're looking at given this period of uncertainty that we have. But our strategy remains the same, and our view is if an acquisition along the way that presents itself has compelling, very compelling economics, we will analyze that within our current liquidity outlook and do our best to try to continue to execute our strategy.
Operator: Your next question comes from Wagar Syed - Tristone Capital Inc.
Wagar Syed - Tristone Capital Inc.:  My question relates to the Manifa project. Have you started seeing revenues come in from there and what kind of sort of growth do you see in the fourth quarter and next year?
Tim Probert: No, the Manifa project for us does not start until Q1. Drilling starts in Q1, and so we have not seen any revenues at this point. Though we are just in the process of mobilizing for the project. 
Wagar Syed - Tristone Capital Inc.: Previously you'd mentioned you were expecting it about in the fourth quarter, so there's been some delays there or am I mistaken originally it was supposed to be starting fourth quarter?
Tim Probert: No, I think we've pretty much - we have certainly had no material delays in the startup of the project. The end of Q4, beginning of Q1 has always been kind of the target range. 
Dave Lesar: Yes, I think what we've said in the past is that we would be incurring costs during the fourth quarter and would have perhaps hoped to have some revenue in in Q4. But right now it looks like we have the costs but the revenue will come into next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.
Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.:  Maybe further to Bill's question on North American margins, I wanted to ask a little bit on the cost recovery piece of that. I think Mark mentioned 70 basis points of recovery were costs that were passed on, and so presumably that doesn't just go away. You keep those recoveries on until your costs come down.  And then, related to that - again, without repeating all the stuff that Bill was talking about - you did mention sort of the timeframe similar to '07. I think you were speaking about the recovery and balance in the gas markets but, you know, '07, '06 margin compression, is that the kind of margin compression we could be looking at? Is that potentially what we'd be alluding to there? 
Mark McCollum:  Let me talk about the fuel surcharge and I'll let Tim sort of handle the second part of the question. On the fuel surcharges, again, it is a surcharge and what those agreements did was sort of establish a base level of cost that we were incurring for fuel and fuel-based chemicals and things like that prior to the run up in cost in the second quarter. And it works on a one-quarter lag, so this quarter we were getting recovery for incremental costs incurred in the second quarter.  And as you know, I mean, fuel prices decreased during the third quarter and so, while there might be a little bit that comes through, we don't expect to have a similar impact in the fourth quarter. And the mechanism will adjust going forward as fuel prices move up or down. 
Tim Probert: And to the second part of your question with respect to margins, I think it's really too soon clearly for us to make any kind of prediction in terms of the impact on margins. I'd just simply sort of refer you back to the fact that I think we do feel there are a couple of - there's kind of an overlay with some mitigating elements here with respect to the sort of flight to quality that I sort of commented on earlier with respect to the assets that our customers are choosing to develop relative to some of their more traditional assets, which they're probably going to sit on for the time being.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets:  I just had a question on, as we head out into 2009 with these Capex cuts, whether or not you think that it's going to be a lot more broader based across your product lines than what occurred in the late '06 and into '07. At that point it was, I think, predominantly just frac based. You saw some pretty good strength in MWD, LWD, etc. So do you think that whatever downtick happens in '09, you think it's going to be more broad-based?
Tim Probert: You know, again, as I mentioned before, too early to say, but, again, we've seen certainly a significant change in well construction activity since the last cycle. And that well construction activity change has really revolved around the increase in service intensity driven by horizontal wells. So that's certainly something that we would need to take into account as we look forward because that clearly has a more positive element [break in audio] because horizontal rig activity probably will continue to rise as a percentage of total rig activity in the U.S. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: And just as a follow up, any rough guidelines for us as to how much of your International business is already a lock for '09?
Tim Probert: No, just as you know, typically North America tends to be on much shorter-term agreements. International agreements tend to be longer term, typically in the three to five-year range. So that's really all we can say at the present time.
Christian Garcia: Okay, that will do it. We'd like to thank everyone for participating in today's call. 
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2008 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Christian Garcia, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Christian Garcia: Good morning, and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2008 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Halliburton's website for 7 days, a podcast download will also be available. The press release announcing the second quarter results is available at the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO, Mark McCollum, CFO and Tim Probert, Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development. In today's call, Dave will provide opening remarks, Mark will discuss our overall financial performance, and Tim will provide comments on our operations and business outlook. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. Before turning the call over to Dave, I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views, about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial result and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 or Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Please note that, we will be using the term 'International' to refer to our operations outside the U.S. and Canada, and we will refer to the combination of U.S. and Canada, as North America. Now, I'll turn the call over to, Dave Lesar. Dave?
Dave Lesar: Thanks, Christian, and good morning to everyone. The company posted another excellent quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 20%. Our International revenue grew 26%, which was in excess of our 20% goal. With Latin America continuing it's growth momentum with a 33% year-over-year growth. We expect robust activity in this region to continue for the remainder of the year, as we execute our strategy in this market. Overall, our revenues grew 11% sequentially, despite the pricing pressures in frac in the U.S. We had record revenue this quarter in every product line except Landmark, which typically records its highest revenue in the fourth quarter. Let me now turn to the results of North America and discuss our prospects for the second half of 2008 and onwards. Despite a very negative impact of the spring breakup in our spring Canadian operations and of course, pricing pressure in the frac market, North America revenue for the quarter grew a strong 7% sequentially, due to higher activity in both U.S. land and the Gulf of Mexico. In the U.S., our revenues increased 12% sequentially, as Halliburton continues to benefit from the increase in horizontal drilling activities toward which we have focused our U.S. service portfolio. Our well construction businesses in general and Sperry in particular, have continued to show strong growth in U.S. land market this quarter. Furthermore Canada, has now recovered from a seasonal drop, and we expect strong activity in this market in the second half of 2008. More service-intensive plays such as the Montney in Northeastern British Columbia also are giving us additional opportunities to apply cross product line solutions. Our focus on efficiency and high utilization helped us deliver strong second quarter margins in North America. The pressure pumping pricing environment continued to be competitive. Overall, we experienced the 1% to 2% average pricing decline for fracturing, consistent with our guidance. However, we saw clear signs of prices stabilizing towards the end of the quarter. In fact, the pricing decline was at the lower end of the range we expected. We however, did see continuation of inflationary pressures and increases in fuel and materials that we discussed in the first quarter call. And Mark, will provide an update on this and how we're trying to mitigate them. For our product lines outside of fracturing, pricing has stabilized, with the exception of some minor weakness in our cementing business this quarter. We do not expect continued pricing declines going forward. In fact, currently wireline logging, directional drilling/LWD, and drill bits have the most pricing leverage upside in this market. Our customers have announced revisions to their capital programs for the remainder of 2008 and 2009 for the development of their conventional and unconventional resources. We expect unconventional drilling activity to increase over the second half of the year and be geared more towards service-intensive emerging shale plays like the Haynesville and Marcellus, which will drive demand across all of our service offerings. The formations of these plays are not yet well understood, and require a much more reservoir-focused approach. Tim will provide more color on the technologies that our customers are beginning to employ, to unlock the value of these reservoirs. This increased activity along with the tightening and balancing out of capacity provides us with an improved outlook for all of our businesses. It enhances our ability to increase prices modestly and cover cost inflation. Our fracturing equipment utilization remains high and we've worked to optimize fleet placement. We'll continue to realign our equipment with our customer's assets, where we received better long-term margins and returns. Now, let me turn to our International business. Revenue continued its strong upward momentum with a 26% year-over-year growth. All of our international regions showed growth over 20% with Latin America alone growing above 30%. Sequentially, international revenues increased 15% as operations in Norway, Saudi Arabia, Angola, Mexico, and Brazil continued to expand. International margins for the quarter were 21% even with our continued heavy investments in people, facilities, and equipment to support the next phase of our growth in the Eastern Hemisphere. Margins were additionally impacted this quarter by the ramp-up costs for our Manifa offshore award where drilling is expected to start in Q4 or early next year and reach a total of ten rigs. We continue to expect expansion of international margins, which will be driven by value created from the introduction of new technology, the liability of execution, and the fixed cost leverage offsetting the price competition we're seeing on larger tenders. Project visibility continues to be very good giving us confidence that we will continue to see healthy growth rates throughout the second half of 2008 into 2009 barring a significant global recession due to high commodity prices. We are making good progress and growing profitability in several undeserved markets and are improving our exposure to the highest growth segments of the market. Let me turn the call over to, Mark to give you more financial details.
Mark McCollum: Thanks, Dave and good morning. I'll be comparing our second quarter results sequentially to the first quarter. Halliburton's revenue in the second quarter was $4.5 billion up $458 million or 11% from the first quarter. Landmark, Baroid, Wireline, and production enhancement product lines, registered growth of over 10% sequentially. On a geographic basis all regions showed double-digit increases, except for North America, which grew 7% but was impacted by spring breakup in Canada. And as Dave pointed out, we are expecting a resurgence of activity in Canada in the second half of 2008, at a much higher level than what we had originally anticipated. Operating income increased $102 million or 12% from the first quarter of 2008, representing incremental margins of 22%. Our second quarter results included a $25 million gain on the sale of two investments, which was recognized in North America, in the drilling and evaluation segment, and a charge of $30 million for the settlement of the ReedHycalog patent dispute, which is included in corporate and other. Our first quarter results included $23 million for impairment charges on an oil and gas property in Bangladesh, which was included in the Middle East/Asia drilling and evaluation results and a $35 million gain related to the sale of an investment, which was included in the North American, completion and production results. Now, I'll highlight the results of our two operating segments. Completion and Production revenue increased $246 million or 11% from the first quarter, while operating income increased $32 million or 6%. The higher sequential revenue was led by production enhancement with a growth rate of 15%, driven by increased activity in U.S. land in Oman and our strong vessel utilization in Mexico and the North Sea. Looking at completion and production on a geographic basis, North American C&P revenue increased 9% sequentially. Operating income was flat, as the first quarter results included the $35 million gain previously discussed. The revenue increase was driven by higher activity across all product lines in both U.S. land and the Gulf of Mexico. This was partially offset by a decline in stimulation pricing of 1% to 2%, as well as the seasonal spring breakup in Canada. C&P margins for North America continue to be impacted by higher costs related to materials and fuel prices. However, these increases are largely offset by increased equipment utilization. We've been successful in negotiating fuel surcharges and we should see the impact of these negotiations starting in the third quarter. We have also been talking with our customers about recovering our cost for other consumable materials and will provide an update on these discussions during the third quarter call. In Latin America, completion and production revenue increased 6% in the second quarter, due to strong activity in Mexico, Brazil, and Venezuela. However, the improved top line results were not enough to offset the negative impact of the union strikes in Argentina. So our operating income declined 8%. We are not expecting resolution of the strikes in the coming months, and we are selectively transferring equipment to other countries in the region. Production enhancement experienced sequential revenue growth of 16%, primarily driven by higher vessel utilization in Mexico. In the Europe/Africa/CIS region, completion and production revenue increased 26% and operating income increased 49%. The growth in revenue and operating income was driven by increased completion tool sales and favorable pricing adjustments in West Africa. Strong activity across all product lines in continental Europe and higher vessel utilization in the North Sea, in Middle East/Asia, completion and production posted sequential increases of 5% and 9%, in revenue and operating income respectively. We experienced strong activity in Oman and Saudi Arabia. Our Khurais project in Saudi Arabia is ahead of schedule, and we have started mobilizing for our Manifa project. In addition, strong sales of our completion tools in Indonesia and China contributed to the favorable performance. Now on our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased $212 million or 12% and operating income increased $96 million or 25% from the first quarter. We experienced strong sequential revenue growth in all product lines with Landmark, Baroid, and Wireline posting double-digit increases. The sequential increase in operating income was driven by the flow through of higher revenue in the non-recurring items previously mentioned. Baroid margins increased more than 200 basis points from the first quarter, and posted strong performance across all regions, notably in the U.S., the North Sea, and West Africa. In North America, drilling and evaluation revenue increased 4% and operating income increased by 11% sequentially, as strong performance in our U.S. land operations from Baroid and Sperry offset the seasonally lower Canadian activity. Drilling and evaluation's Latin America revenue increased 27% and operating income improved by 63% from the first quarter. The improvement was driven by higher activity associated with the alliance to integrated project in Southern Mexico. We are currently operating on four PEMEX supplied rigs and anticipate having six rigs by the end of the third quarter. Although, this was a slower ramp-up than we planned, the project is going exceptionally well. We are also seeing strong growth rates across all other countries in the region, except for Argentina and that's again, due to the union strikes. In the Europe/Africa region, drilling and evaluation revenue and operating income increased 9% and 7% respectively. The increase was driven by higher drilling and multilateral activity in the North Sea, increased Wireline activity in North Africa and favorable pricing adjustments in West Africa. Drilling and evaluation revenue in the Middle East/Asia region increased 19%, while operating income improved 65%. Remember that the first quarter results were negatively impacted by the $23 million oil and gas impairment in Bangladesh. Additionally, the increase in operating income was driven by higher activity in Australia, Malaysia, and China across most product lines. In addition, increased Baroid revenues in the Middle East contributed to the strong performance. Now I will address some additional financial items. Nothing unusual on taxes this quarter, we continue to expect our full year 2008 effective tax rate to be in the 30% to 32% range. During the second quarter of 2008, we updated our fair value calculation, related to the indemnities provided to KBR during the separation process, relating to the FCPA investigations and the Barracuda-Caratinga bolt arbitration matter. We recorded an after-tax charge to discontinued operations of $117 million to reflect our most recent assumptions on the potential resolution of these issues. We currently have $1.2 billion of 3.8% convertible bonds outstanding. The conversion option has moved deeply in the money, as our stock price has risen and the current market value of these bonds is ranging around $3 billion to $3.2 billion. Since the market value of the bonds, greatly exceeds the par value and because we now have the ability to call the bonds, although we've not yet elected to do so, a number of bondholders are electing to go ahead and exercise their right to convert. We require to settle the $1.2 billion par amount in cash, though, we have the option to settle the approximately $1.8 billion to $2 billion premium in excess of par in either cash or stock. Now, if we settle the premium in stock, we will do so with the issuance of Halliburton shares from treasury stock. Since the shares required to fully satisfy the premium on the converts, are already included in our fully diluted EPS calculation. Settling the premium in stock, increases our basic share count, but doesn't negatively impact diluted EPS. Now to the extent we settled the premium in cash, our share count will go down, but we will have an immediate earnings charge for the value paid. However, from an EPS standpoint, the higher ongoing interest expense for the increased borrowings should be offset by the lower shares outstanding. We expect our depreciation, depletion and amortization to average approximately $190 million per quarter for the rest of the year. And finally, we're increasing our capital expenditures guidance by $200 million to $1.9 billion to $2 billion for the full year. The incremental capital is to provide for equipment placements on the coming offshore rigs and to meet the growing demand of our customers in the emerging shale plays in North America. Tim?
Tim Probert: Thanks, Mark and good morning, everyone. The continuing increase in shale activity and our role in developing these plays is a very important part of our North American story. As most of you know, as activity shifts toward these plays, Halliburton is well positioned to serve shale operators, because of a combination of our reservoir expertise, proven technologies, and broad infrastructure, necessary to maximum the value of these assets. In the Woodford, for example, stratigraphy and organic content are well understood. But due to their complexity compared to the Barnett, the formations are more difficult to drill and fracture. Horizontal wells in the Woodford are deeper with longer laterals, bigger frac jobs, and more stages. Cementing these long, horizontal section has proved to be a challenge here. So well cemented with conventional slurries have exhibited inadequate isolation of frac targets, which has led to reduced fracturing effectiveness and decreased production. Our zone field cementing systems, have significantly improved the segregation of the targeted frac zones, prevent in communication, and improved productivity. We have more stabilities in issuing the lower Huron Shale in the northeast where reducing exposure to the sensitive shales is critical. A combination of optimized Sperry bottomhole assemblies along with our electromagnetic telemetry technology has trimmed as many as five days from the typical drilling cycle there. Water production and water use are becoming significant challenges for our customers exploiting unconventional and tight reservoirs. In the San Juan and Green River Basin, for example, our water management solutions eliminate the need to use portable water without compromising fluid qualities. Here our OmegaFrac fluid is the first linear fracturing fluid specifically designed to use a wide variety of field-produced brine water, providing cost and environmental benefits to our customers and communities, and we're applying a similar approach in emerging shale plays. Now the Haynesville's in the early development stage and the environment is especially challenging, with average depths over 12,500 feet, bottomhole temperatures approaching 350 degrees Fahrenheit, and wellhead treating pressures exceeding 10,000 psi. This requires the use of specialized drilling, pressure pumping, and fluids technology. Average drilling times are double those of the Barnett and fracturing requires almost twice the amount of hydraulic horsepower at higher treating pressures. We estimate that Haynesville wells are currently about 1.5 to 1.7 times more drilling and fracturing intensive than those in the Barnett. Understanding fracture orientation and geometry is a key element of improving well performance. However, in this microseismic monitoring technology, ExactFrac allows us to monitor frac propagation in real time to maximize well performance. In the Barnett, we recently undertook a client study to evaluate a large number of wells using landmark reservoir modeling tools with the ExactFrac service, to both optimize horizontal well and fracture placements. So, we are pleased with these and other growing capabilities, an important component of the differentiated shale technology portfolio. Some of you may have seen the recent results from the Patent Board, published this month in the Wall Street journal, which provides a scorecard for industries-based on indicators that track global patent activity related to innovation, technology, and science strengths. The energy and environmental industry, the latest survey showed Halliburton to be the leader for the third consecutive time. While, we are pleased with our top ranking, most importantly, the survey confirms the progress we have made in the last few years, in enhancing the depth of our intellectual property and gives us the confidence that we are on track in delivering technology solutions for reservoirs that are becoming increasingly more challenging. We also continue to enhance our technology portfolio through acquisition. During the quarter, we purchased the remaining 49% of WellDynamics, the world's leading provider of intelligent well completion technology. The acquisition provides a significant competitive advantage in delivering increased reservoir productivity and maximized ultimate recovery for our customers. We acquired the Protech Centerform, the only provider of casing centralization that uses a carbon fiber and ceramic composite applied directly to the casing. This complements our range of casing solutions particularly for our customer's deepwater and high-pressure/high-temperature drilling and completion challenges. We also completed the purchase of Knowledge Systems Inc, a respected provider of software and services that improves well planning and drilling by helping clients predict, wellbore, geomechanics, and pore pressure, so wells can be drilled safely and economically. So these three acquisitions strengthen our technology portfolio and give us greater resources to put into our broad distribution channels to support our next phase of growth. Dave?
Dave Lesar: Thanks, Tim. To summarize, we completed another excellent quarter with overall year-over-year growth rates of 20% and continued strong margins. We have seen prices stabilize across all of our product lines in North America. Our customers increased drilling plants, are providing us with a more robust outlook for our services in the second half of the year. And all indications are that the shift of activity towards more service-intensive plays will drive demand for our technologies that are specifically designed for more complex reservoirs. Internationally, we continue to make progress in balancing our geographic portfolio with year-over-year revenue growth of 26%. Margins were above our stated target. We have seen competition intensify, but we believe we are well positioned, given the breadth of our technology and the execution capabilities of our people. And I like to publicly thank our employees worldwide for delivering another excellent quarter. Let's go ahead and open it up for questions, now?
Operator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from David Anderson from UBS. Your question, please?
David Anderson - UBS: Thank you very much. Can you guys just talk a little bit about where you are with your utilization on the frac side and you base them generally on a five-day work week?
Tim Probert: Thanks, Dave. Utilization is very high at the moment. And we certainly have the preponderance of activity on a five-day week. We also have some Saturday work, as well. So really a combination of the both at the moment.
David Anderson - UBS: And I assume you expect that to continue to increase throughout the year?
Tim Probert: Yes, we do. I think particularly as you've sort of heard the commentary during the course of the call. As we get into the third and fourth quarter, we certainly expect the pressure on utilization to increase.
David Anderson - UBS: And with regards to Canada right now, can you just not chat a little about in terms of the capacity situation up there and how does that compare to the U.S.? And do you think you will see any kind of equipment start to migrating north or is there too much activity down here to see that?
Tim Probert: I think as you heard us say, we really are expecting a much stronger second half in Canada, certainly much stronger than we had anticipated in the early part of the year. And as you know, a fair amount of equipment did head south and elsewhere, during the sort of the fall in Canadian activity. I think it's reasonable to assume that some of that will return to Canada to meet the expectations there at the market. Certainly it's an area, that we're undertaking careful consideration in terms of the disposition of our fleets.
David Anderson - UBS: So do you think pricing should move up, as well, in Canada? I guess judging from your comments, I'm shooting for you?
Tim Probert: Yeah. I think most certainly.
David Anderson - UBS: Okay, one last question. You had mentioned in the Haynesville comparing to the Barnett, you said 1.5 to 1.7 times more fracture intensity. Could you just expand upon that a little bit, are you talking about say two comparable five-stage fracs or is just kind of like all in well?
Tim Probert: This is really sort of more on a monthly basis really. I mean, obviously drilling times in the Haynesville are longer, and by the way that 1.5 to 1.7 was both sort of drilling and fracture intensity.
David Anderson - UBS: Okay.
Tim Probert:  But really try to sort of pair that down to a monthly evaluation. So, you can try to get an assessment of what it means in terms of a monthly or quarterly revenue stream.
David Anderson - UBS: Okay So the Haynesville it seems that's, sounds like the area where you're most focused on right now over the next call six months, fair to say?
Tim Probert:  It's clearly early days yet. There's a lot of work to be done. But I think we just wanted to kind of frame it as a point of reference for you in terms of what it might mean for the service industry.
David Anderson - UBS: Great. Tim, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Chuck Minervino of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Chuck Minervino - Goldman Sachs: Good morning. Just a question on pressure pumping as well, given the increased demand outlook here and activity levels, have your supply expectations changed at all for the pressure pumping market for the rest of the year?
Dave Lesar: We had basically told you on our last call that we expected a sort of 12% to 15% increase in capacity for 2008. And we still believe that to be a fairly good number in terms of capacity increases. Again, lead times of equipment are still fairly long, probably in the range of nine months. So any decisions that were made in the last month or so really won't have any impact in terms of North America, until clearly well into 2009.
Chuck Minervino - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then when you stack that up with your demand outlook. Are you looking for really flattish pricing for the remainder of the year or do you actually see pricing increasing in the second half of '08?
Dave Lesar: I think that clearly, it's going to be a matter of timing here. We had earlier expected to see stabilization in the second half of the year and clearly that came quite a lot earlier than we expected. That stabilization occurred in really towards the end of Q2 rather than in Q3 that we had originally expected. So, I think it's reasonable to assume that, we will see modest increases during the course of Q3, but ramping-up perhaps, slightly more as we move in to the back end of the year. And clearly as you know, we're going to be in a renegotiation phase at the end of the year for 2009. And the climate for negotiation is clearly quite a bit different at the end of 2008, than it was at the end of 2007.
Operator: Our next question is from Ole Storer of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. I got a question first on the CapEx. You seem to get more bullish on your business in raising the CapEx. I think, you said from $1.7 billion to $2 billion mentioning that this was partly because of offshore rigs and partly because of shale. Particularly on the offshore, what is it that's changed since the beginning of the year, given that most of these offshore rigs under construction have been visible for quite a while. So, what is it that triggered the greater enthusiasm for that space?
Mark McCollum:  Ole of course, we monitor all of our projects on an ongoing basis. This is really I would say as much as anything an adjustment to our view of the future with respect to the projects which we see, the projects which we think we should receive. Clearly, North America plays a part in that picture, as well. So I think you should take this generally speaking as a good sign of our confidence in the market ahead.
Dave Lesar: Ole, this is Dave. Let me add to that. Also with the delay of the arrival of lot of the offshore rigs, we diverted that equipment that we had built in anticipation of that marketplace developing into other parts of the business. And to some extent, we're now having to backfill that equipment to meet those rigs as they're coming on.
Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley: Okay. That makes sense. Secondly, Mexico on the counter-bid, you bid at quite a different level to the company that was awarded the contract. Could you comment a little bit on that, as well as your, strategy on future IPM work or project management work in Mexico, you've been awarded a small contract there. But are you targeting some of the bigger tenders coming up or what's your strategy?
Mark McCollum: Let sort of talk about IPM in general for us. That's obviously, a very important part of our portfolio, and as we may have mentioned before, sort of on any given day we're sort of operating typically around about 30 IPM projects of one kind to another in about ten countries around the globe. So we have a pretty important portfolio. And certainly Latin America represents the most important part of that portfolio, also the U.S., North Africa and so forth are other important elements of the portfolio. But yes, we certainly intend to participate and support primarily of our NOC customers, as they tend to turn a little bit more towards this approach to help them develop and exploit that fields.
Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley: So just to finish. How do you see that opportunity compared to what's going on in the new offshore market? Is there any difference in margin if you allocate your tools to an onshore project versus allocating them to the offshore?
Mark McCollum: Well I think as we may have commented to you on the prior call actually, if we take a look at our international business in general, about half our business internationally is driven by offshore activity. And both our share and margin are slightly better in offshore activities. So that sort of gives you a sort of a general guide. Of course, IPM type activities are not always exclusive to onshore, they also take place in offshore activities as well such as we've completed in the North Sea. So, it's really a blend I think of both.
Ole Storer - Morgan Stanley: Okay, well done. Congratulations for the very good performance.
Mark McCollum: Thanks, Ole.
Operator: Our next question is from Jim Crandell of Lehman Brothers. Your question, please.
Jim Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Just as the follow-up to Ole's question, that you have said earlier or Dave said earlier, that one of the negative things about margin was pricing competition on large tenders. Do you consider your IPM business in general to be a lower margin business than your ongoing international business, since you cited it in your opening comments? And it seems that everybody likes to snipe at each others IPM contracts. There's certainly been a lot of talk about how far down you bid on Manifa to win that contract. Would that fall into that category about a lower margin business than your total?
Mark McCollum: Yeah. I think there's a lot of discussion around IPM activities. And just sort of for the record we really don't consider Manifa to be an IPM project. It's something which we project manage ourselves. But for us the definition of IPM really requires us to have some involvement in the management of rigs and the total operation, just to sort of put a little clarity to that. But I think within the scope of our definition in terms of IPM, as I said we think it's a really important part of the portfolio. It's clearly a model, which is in favor for a member of our large national oil company customers and it's something that we intend to respond to as a company. We also intend to manage the risk and ensure that clearly our execution is up to snuff to ensure that we deliver the margins, which are consistent with the rest of our business.
Jim Crandell - Lehman Brothers: You said though, Tim, that our price competition on larger tenders would be sort of a negative offsetting factor to other factors giving profit margins. So if they ask question again, is your IPM business lower margin business overall, than your rest of your international oil service business? And can you give some percentage or rough guidance on how many of these 30 IPM projects, you considered to be competitively bid and where there is the price competition that you said right off the bat in your opening comments?
Tim Probert: Jim, with regard to the comment regarding larger contracts I think in the international space, we can clearly say that the overall sort of size of the tranches of work, which are being led by our customers IPM or not, becoming significantly larger. And this is for a number of reasons, some of which are related to the ability to get access to services and some obviously are related to bargaining power of our customer base. But the point is as the projects are tending to get larger and it requires us to ensure that, we obviously execute well. But it also requires that we provide new technologies into those contracts to ensure that during the life of those contracts, we manage them from start to finish to ensure that we drive margin improvement during the life of the contract.
Mark McCollum: Jim, this is Mark. I also want to add on to your specific question about the margin differentials between IPM work and the rest of our international business. They are not that much different, they're very much inline. And that's how we risk manage these things to make sure that we deliver for our shareholders.
Jim Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Mark, thank you. That's very helpful. One final question. You talked about the one year tenders being renegotiated in a much different environment, as we get towards the end of the year. Would you expect given the cost increases for labor materials, etcetera. Would you expect to have real price improvement on your one year tenders' roll over as they take place later this year or in early 2009?
Dave Lesar: Yeah, Jim, this is Dave. Let me answer that one. I think that we're somewhat in the environment we were a couple of years ago, where I think we were clearly press for our price increases. But I think, what you are going to see is that you will get specifically allocated price increases for such things as shortages in certain commodity chemicals, fuel prices, that sort of thing, as sort of a pass-through increase. And then, we will negotiate for a price increase on the base services work. I think, we probably are a little bit further down the road before we'll be able to push for sort of a peer price increase like we were getting a couple of years ago.
Tim Probert: Well, I think it's also fair to say, we are not waiting for the contract rollovers to go after the cost recovery portion.
Operator: Our next question is from Mike Urban of Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to dig a little bit more on today's favourite topic, IPM. Is some of that competitive pressure that you're seeing out there based on competitors who own rigs, bidding those more aggressively or is it difficult to tell or is it just kind of across the board competitive pressure on those large projects?
Mark McCollum: I think that really the main issue is having access to rigs. And our position to this point has been that we do not wish to own rigs. We partner with suppliers of rigs to execute. We have a number of, I think very good examples in a number of markets, where we've developed strong relationships and execute collectively very well against our targets for our customers. So at this point, no I don't think it's a particular disadvantage to us at all.
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank: I mean I would agree in terms of the efficiency that you guy's offer and the quality of the service. But, is there a sense out there that those competitors are bidding perhaps, below market rates on the rigs in order to come in low on the project as a whole?
Mark McCollum: I am not sure why anyone would want to do that. In today's current market I guess it's possible. But I think they would be leaving some money on the table, if they did.
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank: And the follow-up to that, it pertains to the international margins as a whole. I think you've spoken to this a little bit given that you're getting some aggressive pricing on the large projects. Would you say that pricing on kind of the non-IPM work is improving on average or is it more of the infrastructure leverage and the up selling that's driving the margin improvement you expect?
Dave Lesar: I think, this is Dave, I think it's a little bit of both. Certainly, you have the leverage of the expanding footprint and your ability to take on more volume and provide you absolute operating income dollars. But also the theory around these bigger projects is to get in and then up sell your new technologies because typically these are multiple-year contracts, in many cases with options to extend that our customers hold. So, it's paramount basically to get in, get the project, and then up sell. And I think that we've done a pretty good job of doing that over the past several years. And that's no secret formula out there I mean everybody tries to do it. But I think it's something that we've gotten pretty good at.
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your question, please.
Kurt Hallead - RBC: Hey, good morning. Just wanted to try to calibrate a couple of things. On one of its call yesterday, they reference price increases about 10% to 15% in North America. And then, they mentioned something like 15% plus price increases internationally. They did reference the fact that it was varied by product line and so on. But I just want to try to gauge how that jives with how you're seeing the market right now?
Mark McCollum: I'm sure it's not unreasonable to expect on certain items or products to see pricing increase in those ranges. And certainly, when you take a look at the overall inflation for hydrocarbon-based goods, so let's say specialty chemicals, for example, or for that matter machined items, etcetera. The inflation has really been quite substantial. So, it's not unreasonable to assume that those maybe quite reasonable rates. I think however, for a broad basket of services such as within Halliburton's portfolio, I think the guidance that we gave you a little earlier is probably closer to being more appropriate.
Kurt Hallead - RBC: Okay. And just wanted to follow-up also when the Slumberjay talked on last Friday, they gave a pretty positive outlook with respect to an acceleration in international programs. And I wanted to see if that's kind of caused you guys to get more optimistic with your growth rate for international business for 2009?
Mark McCollum: Well, as we sort of commented a little bit earlier. We did adjust our capital outlook slightly, as we sort of readjusted that portfolio with respect to, portfolio of projects if you like. So we continue to see a very robust outlook and certainly have no reason to sort of diminish our enthusiasm for the coming year.
Kurt Hallead - RBC: Again that CapEx increase was for offshore and for shale, most of that seems like it's going to be geared for North America. But I was just trying to get a reference point on how incrementally optimistic you are about international growth rates?
Mark McCollum: I think what I said was that a lot of the stuff that we had planned for the offshore rigs has actually been diverted already into the U.S. market. So, the increase in capital we're looking at actually is to serve the non-North America and offshore markets. So, I think that sort of bodes well and gives an indication of our enthusiasm for what we see to be continued growth rates in Eastern Hemisphere.
Kurt Hallead - RBC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Michael LaMotte of JPMorgan. Your question, please.
Michael LaMotte - JPMorgan: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I don't know if Dave or Tim, if you're better to answer this question. But I'm trying to think about the North American market and really how it's changing versus maybe the 05/06 timeframe, where it was all about, build the equipment and provide as much slick frac capacity, as you can. And as the new shale plays emerge, it's very clear that the technology penetration and uptake is a lot greater?  And I am just wondering sort of how and I guess two part question here, one is how is marketing to the client different today versus a few years ago with respect to North America? And two if we consider the margin opportunity in this kind of technology oriented environment. Could we actually see profitability get better than what we saw in 05/06?
Tim Probert:  I think on a broad basis, let's just sort of take a look at sort of I think the roots of this question really revolves around sort of is there a bifurcation of the market or not between the sort of the major players and perhaps the new entrants. And it might be helpful just to reference some data that Spears & Associates provided in terms of trending of both horsepower and revenues overtime. So they indicated that from 2003 to 2007 that the horsepower of the big three in proportion to the total industry dropped from around about 75% to about 50%. And interesting that if you look at the amount of revenues for the same time period, proportion of revenue that the big three had in relation to the entire industry dropped from about 80% to roughly 75%. So, I think you can really see there's really a significant difference in the revenue for horsepower between the big three players and the smaller fracturing players. And I'm convinced that this is clearly a representation of the technology, which is applied in the value, which is received. So, I think that's point number one. And point number two for us, you've heard us say a couple of times that we're really very focused on trying to balance the portfolio in North America between all our various product lines. So, no longer for us is it solely about fracturing by itself. We're really trying to put together a group of products and services in an efficiency model for our customers that really can drive value and productivity for them. And if I was to sort of call out one most significant change for us over the sort of 2005 timeframe, I think it's the maturity which we have in that kind of approach to our markets and our customers.
Michael LaMotte - JPMorgan: That's helpful color, Tim. And maybe, if I think about that trend of '03 to '07 with the technology penetration rate seeming to increase would it be fair to say that, that should trend to a faster rate over the next few years?
Tim Probert: Yeah.
Michael LaMotte - JPMorgan: It terms of revenue per horsepower?
Tim Probert: Yeah. I believe that our customers today are really becoming very focused on the productivity of their wells. And some of the color commentary that I was trying to provide a little earlier was I think our commentary on some of the thoughtfulness, which our customers are entering into with respect to the longevity and the investment that they're making in these plays and the need to ensure that it's not about simply punching wells down. It's really about maximizing the productivity. And I think that really, is really something which will be very beneficial to us and others that can offer something similar to the market.
Dave Lesar: I think, this is Dave. Let me just add one last comment. I think not only do you have sort of a bifurcation going on around the ability and the technology of the frac. But you also have much more of a linking together of all their other product lines on some of these shale plays. Tim mentioned earlier, the need to get a very specific and different sort of cement job down, before you can do the number of stages of fracing you want to do. The placement in a well using directional drilling is much more important. So, we're seeing more of our customers in these types of play's come to us for sort of a multiple product line solution. And I think that will also help differentiate the bigger service companies from those that perhaps don't have as strong as cementing or drilling or completion position, than some of the newer entrants might have.
Michael LaMotte - JPMorgan: That's great. Thanks. Mark, a couple of quick cleanup questions for you. Looking at cash balances I'm trying to reconcile the dip in interest income from run rate in the last few quarters?
Mark McCollum: It's really driven by a couple of different things. One is obviously, interest rates have fallen this year and so that's having an influence. The other side of it last year, we did have some option rate securities. We got out of those in early January, no losses on our part. But effectively that lowered our overall yields. And so, that's really the two drivers of our interest income.
Michael LaMotte - JPMorgan: Okay. And then lastly, on the KBR arbitrations any timetable when that investigation or arbitration process will be wrapping up?
Mark McCollum: No, no, there's really no timetable. Obviously, we've had ongoing discussions all along with the Department of Justice, with the SEC, and then the arbitration matter is continuing on and we've been fully cooperating with those investigations. The update that we did from an accounting standpoint is a normal process using an outside third-party to help us do that. And we're obviously working to resolve them as quickly as we can. But we're not really the sole drivers of that timetable.
Operator: The next question is from Dan Pickering of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your question, please.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company: Good morning, guys. I wanted to circle back to this international growth opportunity. Dave in your comments earlier, you kind of called out that the second quarter grew 26% year-over-year and kind of above your 20% expectation, and just coming back to I mean, is this growth rate sustainable?
Mark McCollum: Well I think Dan we had set a long-term goal of growing in excess of 20% a year in our non North American operations. And we don't see anything out there right now that would say that it's not sustainable.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company: Okay, thank you. And then I guess a philosophical question, as it relates to the North American market particularly in pressure pumping. Last cycle pricing went up very quickly, margins expanded very quickly, and a lot of new competitors came in, capacity additions, Tim, you addressed that in your discussion around capacity growth. As you think about this market developing going forward, do we just let prices go where they will run them up as much as we can or is it a more measured approach to sort of manage the capacity additions that might come as well?
Mark McCollum: A couple of differences perhaps, I'll maybe comment and then Dave will obviously, add any comments, if he sees fit. I think we're in a very different environment. We're clearly in a more inflationary environment today than we were in the sort of 2005 timeframe. So I think there clearly is an element of sort of recovery here, which has to take place, which clearly will mute pricing realization relative to the 2005 timeframe. I think that having been through a cycle of unbridled optimism in North America, I think it's our general belief, that we'll see perhaps a sort of more ordered process this time. And whilst we'll certainly see some pricing leverage, I am not sure that we are certainly planning on anything like the sort of 2005/2006 timeframe.
Dave Lesar: And I think, Dan, just to add a little bit to that. I think the larger pressure pumping companies on sort of the last cycle, really tried to balance revenue growth with margin growth. Whereas I think, some of the newer entrants were very much interested in market share and revenue growth, with not as much attention being paid to sort of the return on capital and the return on investment they've made on that equipment. And I think that as the market has moved more back into balance, I would hope that is that everybody is sort of has learned our lesson and that you really do need to balance the revenue growth with the margin growth. But I think for the reasons we articulated earlier, there really has been a bifurcation in the market too, in terms of sort of what part of the streets or what part of the neighbourhood, you can play in as a pressure pumping company. And I think that will be a bit of a limiting factor on the number of newer entrants that perhaps can come in to some of these more specialized plays.
Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Robin Shoemaker of Citigroup. Your question, please.
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: Thanks. Just to change the topic for a minute. I wanted to ask a question about your M&A strategy post the Expro situation. It seemed that, that would have been clearly a much different kind of merger than the ones you've transacted here in the last year and I think, you described it as transformational. But in light of that experience, what do you think are the prospects for Halliburton making a merger or an acquisition that would grow your international footprint entering new market such as Expro would have done, in the current kind of competitive environment for M&A?
Mark McCollum: Well, thanks, Robin for that question. I think, clearly we continue to be very active in terms of our M&A pursuits. You saw that we closed three acquisitions during the course of the quarter, all of which have some element of support for international market. And so really, we're focused in two main areas. Number one is the sort of shall I say technology additions for which we can utilize our distribution network around the globe to enhance their growth and secondly in a certain number of areas, some geographic acquisitions, where we feel we're not as well served as you would like to be and in which case, we can take our technologies and put them through that distribution network. So we continue to have an active program. We kind of committed to you that we would continue to focus on that and that's something that we certainly expect to do. I think it's fair to say that it is a fairly aggressive market and we have to make our choices. And we have to have a bright line beyond which we will not cross in terms of pricing and value. But nonetheless, we still feel there are a number of opportunities out there.
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: Right. Yeah, understood it. You mentioned earlier, I think you described them as underserved markets. I assume that's both organic and potentially M&A. What I mean just upon a geographic kind of basis, what are the in your mind the primary underserved markets?
Mark McCollum: We've sort of publicly stated several of those underserved markets, and clearly Russia is one of those markets, where we do feel we've got significant headroom opportunity. I think India is another market to which we were somewhat late to play. So those would be two examples of two significantly underserved markets for us. I should add that though, it would only be fair to add that, our growth rate in those markets is very good. However, it is clearly from the smaller base than we would ideally like.
Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup: Yes, right. Okay, thank you.
Christian Garcia: We'll take one more question.
Operator: Our final question is from Alan Laws of Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: Good morning. I know, we always ask you about fracturing capacity additions. I wonder if, you could talk a little bit about the supply/demand balance and what that looks like for the cementing equipment. You talked about in your comments some weakness in the quarter, was that a regional phenomenon or is that kind of a broadly based statement?
Mark McCollum: No, actually the cementing overall sort of really held up much more so than the fracturing business, during the course of the last couple of quarters. And our feeling is that the slight softness that we saw during the course of the second quarter was somewhat temporary. So we really don't see this being a long-term phenomenon. We are fairly sure that the capacity adds in this sector, don't materially change the overall balance here.
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And you also talked about kind of multiple product lines. And wondered if you could comment a little bit on if there are any chokepoints in providing those packaged services? And maybe talk a little bit about in particular directional drilling business, and how tight that presently is in North America?
Tim Probert: Directional drilling clearly is an area of tightness on a global basis actually. So if I was to sort of point to one area in the sort of provision of services overall, I will probably say that in North America that is one where there is some degree of tightness. Though I believe that, within Halliburton, the work which we've undertaken to expand our manufacturing and supply chain capacity is something which allows us to meet the demand from our key customers.
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thanks. The one last thing, I just wanted to ask is about the Rockies market, a big market for you. Could you talk about maybe the outlook for growth there, given developing capacity issues on the REX pipeline, if you thought about those things at all internally?
Tim Probert: Yeah. I mean, clearly this sort of continues to, the Rockies clearly is a very important location for us in North America, clearly one of the stars for us. And we continue to be very enthusiastic about the outlook particularly driven by REXs.
Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch: All right. Thanks a lot.
Christian Garcia: Okay. That concludes our call this morning. Please call us, if you have any further questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator:  Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator instructions). I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. Christian Garcia, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Garcia, you may begin.
Christian Garcia: Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton first quarter 2008 conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and the replay will be available on Halliburton’s website for seven days. A podcast download will also be available. The press release announcing the first quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO, Mark McCollum, CFO and Tim Probert, Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development. In today’s call Dave will provide opening remarks, Mark will discuss our overall financial performance, followed by Tim who will provide comments on our operations and business outlook. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks.  Before turning the call over to Dave I’d like to remind our audience that some of today’s comments may include forward looking statements reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events and their potential impact performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and recent current reports on form 8K. In addition, please refer to the table in the Halliburton press release that reconciles past reported results to adjusted results for the non GAAP disclosures. Also note that in our prepared remarks we will be using the term international to refer to our operations outside the US and Canada and we will refer to the US and Canada as North America. Now I’ll turn the call over to Dave Lesar. Dave.
David Lesar:  Thank you Christian and good morning everyone. It isn’t often that a business as complex as ours that things go about as predicted, but this was one of those quarters for Halliburton. I will first comment on our first quarter results for both North America and the international markets. I will then talk about where we see things heading for the second quarter and onwards. We had two non-recurring items in the first quarter that essentially offset each other, a gain on the sale of a joint venture interest and a write off on the last required well to be drilled on a 1996 investment in an oil and gas property. My comments will exclude the impact of both of these items.  We said in our fourth quarter call that despite the pressures in the US market and the traditional seasonal fall off of our international business that we saw business remaining strong well into the future. We still strongly believe that this is the case. In Q1 we achieved the following results: total revenue for the quarter was $4 billion which represents growth of 18% over the first quarter of 2007. All of our service lines showed strong revenue growth over the prior year with completion tools, drill bits, sperry and landmark each generating growth rates above 20%. We posted quarterly record revenue for cementing, sperry and drill bits and we continue to make good progress in developing a balanced service portfolio.  We said in our fourth quarter call that sequential revenue and operating income would likely be down in both North America and internationally. And overall our revenue was down 4% sequentially. However, North America revenue was flat sequentially as the rebound in Canadian activity and excellent performance by our drilling and evaluation segment which was up 5% sequentially offset the expected decline in production enhancement revenues from the impact of lower pricing that was discussed extensively with you last quarter.  We also had weaker results in the Gulf of Mexico as work during this period shifted towards drilling and away from completions where we have a leading market position. Like many of you we were pleasantly surprised by the upswing in the Canadian market this quarter. There are signs of strong resurgence in activity after spring breakup. And if appropriate we will selectively transfer resources to Canada to take advantage of that market’s recovery.  Our margins in North America only declined by 210 basis points from fourth quarter levels primarily as a result of the lower effective pricing for our US fracturing business which was somewhat offset by a 7% sequential growth in operating income from the drilling and evaluation segment. The pricing declines in our fracturing business were in the mid to upper single digits and were consistent with our guidance. For our US fracturing business, we are starting to see pricing pressures level off in certain areas but overall the environment remains very competitive.  Pricing declines in the transactional markets are easing in areas where activity is increasing and where job and base and complexity favors our differentiated fracturing technologies. We also reported to you in the fourth quarter that we saw pricing pressures for cementing, drilling fluids and wire line. We are now seeing those prices stabilize and even improve for some of these businesses. All of this helped to mitigate the impact of the drop in production enhancement margins. In addition to the impact of pricing from the fourth quarter and now some of the first quarter contract rollovers, we are also experiencing some cost inflation for fuel and fuel based supplies and services which are putting downward pressure on the entire industry’s margins.  We are attempting to mitigate these costs by optimizing procurement practices and implementing fuel surcharges to customers when applicable. We also discussed in the fourth quarter call that we expected international revenues to grow year over year but also to decline sequentially due to the typical large seasonal drop off we see from the fourth quarter to first quarter and from lower completion products and landmark sales. Revenue was also negatively impacted by slowdowns in the North Sea, Nigeria and fracturing activity in Russia. We see Russia improving in the second quarter and for the rest of the year, but are less optimistic about business in Nigeria and the North Sea coming back strong due to geopolitical and rig constraint and project delay issues.  We said that we have set a target to grow our international business at around 20% year over year with sustainable margins and we certainly accomplished this in the first quarter. Our international markets saw strong year on year revenue growth of 24% led by Latin America with a growth of 26% over the prior year. Our Latin America region achieved record quarterly revenue, generating more than $500 million for the first time. Latin America operating income was also a record, surpassing $100 million in the quarter.  We experienced strong growth rates in Columbia, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, across both of our divisions. In the past year we have worked in aligning the delivery of our technology with the requirements of the international market and the first quarter’s results demonstrate the success of those efforts. In the quarter, Halliburton had two significant contract wins, the Statoil completions work in the North Sea and the offshore portion of the Manifa project in Saudi Arabia which demonstrates the confidence our customers have in our ability to execute on large scale complex projects.  These awards not only provide us incremental business for two of our largest markets but also solidify our position in the offshore market and Tim will provide additional comments on our offshore opportunities. While our international operating margins remained above 20%, they were impacted by the absence of the higher margins experienced from the seasonally impacted landmark software and completion tools sales revenues between the fourth and first quarter.  Also impacting margins were the previously discussed decline in revenues in the North Sea, West Africa and fracturing businesses in Russia, all of which are serviced from established high fixed cost operating businesses for Halliburton. In these countries the decline in revenue has a significant impact on the bottom line. Looking forward our North America customers are telling us that with continued strong natural gas fundamentals, they will be reevaluating their drilling plans for the second half of the year. We expect that this will lead to volume increases over what we originally anticipated as well as start to mitigate the pricing pressure we have seen in our fracturing business.  On the international front we expect to see our growth initiatives continue our upward momentum. With international spending expected to increase this year, our global footprint gives us an outstanding position to benefit disproportionately from the spending growth and we do not believe international margins have peaked, although price competition has increased. Let me turn the call over to Mark for a few minutes and let him comment on the financial results.
Mark McCollum:  Thanks Dave and good morning. I’ll be comparing our first quarter results sequentially to the fourth quarter. Halliburton’s revenue in the first quarter was $4 billion, down $150 million or 4% from the fourth quarter. This is consistent with the company’s typical seasonal patterns for the beginning of the year. We registered good growth rates for sperry drilling services, drill bits and cementing. On a geographic basis, Latin American revenue grew 4% and as Dave pointed out, North America revenue was essentially flat from the prior quarter. All other regions showed seasonal declines.  Operating income decreased by $60 million from the fourth quarter or 7%. Our first quarter included $23 million for impairment charges on the oil and gas property and a $35 million gain related to the sale of the joint venture interest. Our fourth quarter 2007 numbers included $34 million in oil and gas impairment charges and $12 million of executive separation cost. Operating income margins declined by 70 basis points from the prior quarter due to the seasonal slowdowns and price declines in our US fracturing business, offset in part by these special items.  Now I’ll highlight the segment results. Completion and production revenue decreased $98 million or 4% from the fourth quarter, while operating income declined $42 million or 7% from the fourth quarter. Included in the segment’s operating income is the gain on the sale of the joint venture interest. We experienced lower sequential revenue for production enhancement and completion tools which were partially offset by higher activity in cementing.  Looking at completion and production on a geographic basis, Latin America revenue increased 19% and operating income increased by 38% sequentially. The growth in revenue and operating income was driven by higher vessel utilization in Mexico, recovery from the fourth quarter union strike in Argentina and increased activity in Venezuela and Brazil. In North America, completion and production revenue declined 3% and operating income fell 5% compared to the fourth quarter. US results were affected primarily by the impact of fracturing pricing and the contract rollovers in the fourth quarter and by lower completions activity in the Gulf of Mexico.  This has been partially offset by strong Canadian activity for production enhancement, completion tools, cementing and the gain related to the sale of the joint venture interest. As Dave indicated we are experiencing cost pressures in the US for fuel and fuel based products and services. We estimate that this negatively impacted our US margins by about 50-100 basis points but we’re actively taking steps to mitigate this impact going forward. In the Middle East Asia region, completion and production revenue declined by 6% and operating income declined by 24% over the fourth quarter.  Completion tools had lower revenue and less favorable product mix in the first quarter from both India and China due to the customer’s seasonal buying cycles and reduced intelligent well system sales for the Middle East. In addition, production enhancement revenue declined resulting from lower activity in Oman, Australia and China. In the Europe Africa region, we posted a revenue decline of 15% and a 20% decrease in operating income from the prior quarter.  This was the result of lower activity for production enhancement due to seasonality in the North Sea and contract delays in Russia and West Africa. Completion tools had lower intelligent well system shipments from our well dynamics joint venture compared to the fourth quarter. Now in our drilling and evaluation division, revenue declined $52 million or 3% and operating income declined $19 million or 5% from the fourth quarter. Strong sequential revenue growth in sperry and drill bits partially offset declines in landmark, wire line and baroid. Operating income declined sequentially due to the typical first quarter seasonal decline in landmark revenue and reduced sales for wire line. We expect to see increased wire line activity over the course of the year driven by strengthening demand.  Our drill bits product line is benefitting from strong customer acceptance of our XR reamer tool internationally. In North America, drilling and evaluation revenue increased 5% and operating income increased by 7% as compared to the fourth quarter. Increased operating income was the result of exceptional performance in Canada from sperry, drill bits and baroid. In addition to the strong performance in Canada, baroid and drill bits experienced robust activity in US land and sperry had higher activity in the Gulf of Mexico.  While the Canadian market rebounded from fourth quarter levels, we will see lower activity in the second quarter as spring breakup will be in full swing. In the Europe Africa region, drilling and evaluation revenue declined by 5% and operating income was down by 12% sequentially due to seasonal declines in landmark revenue and in the North Sea. Additionally, we incurred logistics cost and lower activity in West Africa, particularly in Nigeria.  The revenue and operating income declines were partially offset by strong performance by sperry and drill bits elsewhere in the region. Sperry’s revenue in Russia grew by almost 80% sequentially as we integrated the Burservice acquisition we announced late last year. Sperry also had higher multilateral and LWD activity in the Caspian this quarter. Drilling and evaluations Latin America revenue declined 7% and operating income decreased 18% from the fourth quarter. The decline was primarily driven by lower landmark revenue throughout the region, partially offset by higher sperry activity in Ecuador and Mexico.  Baroid had lower revenue sequentially but improved operating results due to more favorable product mix and higher activity in Venezuela. Drilling and evaluation revenue in the Middle East Asia region declined 10% while operating income declined 11%. The decline in operating income for the region was driven by the landmark seasonality and reduced wire line sales and services to Asia. Now I’ll address some additional financial items.  Corporate expenses for the first quarter were in line with our previous guidance and we expect them to remain in the $65-$70 million range for the remainder of the year. The first quarter effective tax rate for continuing operations was 29%, slightly below our guidance, but in line with our recent trend of lower effective rates driven by increased international earnings. We continue to expect the normalized 2008 effective tax rate to fall in the range of 30% to 32%.  During the first quarter we repurchased approximately 10 million common shares at an average price of $37.26 per share for a total cost of $360 million. As we’ve indicated in our fourth quarter call, we evaluate the allocation of our cash between acquisitions and stock buybacks as market conditions change in order to provide good return for our shareholders. That allocation strategy will certainly be a factor in our evaluation of the Expro opportunity that we are currently considering. And finally our capital expenditure guidance remains in the range $1.7-$1.8 billion for the full year. Tim.
Tim Probert:  Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. As Dave mentioned the second half of this year suggests more robust drilling activity in North America given the strong commodity prices. The past few months have seen announcements from our customers regarding increased activity in newly targeted shale developments.  This recent surge in new plays has been enabled by developments in fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies that have increased recovery rates and improved shale gas economics and continues the established trend towards unconventional production in North America. Ultimately production from each shale development requires a high level of reservoir understanding as the shale’s composition and behavior can changed during drilling, completion and even production.  In the Marcellus and Woodford shales for example, we’ve worked with our customers using techniques such as our proprietary shale eval service to provide enhanced understanding of the reservoir and to improve completion efficiencies from less than 25% to over 75%. Dave also touched on our US pricing environment, but let me share with you some thoughts on what we expect to see going forward. We previously anticipated US rig count growth in the 3.5-4.5% range and this estimate is likely to be exceeded given the current commodity prices. We continue to see an increase in fracturing intensity.  We anticipated that capacity additions for the North America stimulation market would be in the 10% range for the year. We’re monitoring this closely and estimate that the industry’ s capacity is now likely to grow 12-15% as equipment returns from overseas due to an improving outlook in the US and the possibility of a few small entrants into the market. The prospects of increased drilling activity, increased service intensity indicate to us that the additional capacity from our revised estimate can be meaningfully absorbed and the overall market outlook provides us greater confidence in the stabilization of pricing by the end of the second quarter.  We expect that having concluding pricing rollover negotiations, our average frac pricing will decline in the second quarter by 1-2%, while leading edge pricing will stabilize. We continue to be pleased with the growth of our international revenue. There are some areas I’d like to point out that will be important in shaping the company’s outlook. There have been considerable discussions regarding the impact of the influx of offshore rigs in 2008 and 2009. Currently offshore activity represents approximately half of the company’s total revenue internationally.  It’s a service and technology intensive segment. Our average offshore revenue per rig is 3-4 times that of our onshore business and has grown about 50% since 2005. We’re satisfied with our offshore market share which is meaningfully higher than that of our land based businesses and the contract wins this quarter offer us the opportunity to solidify our position. Deep water spending represents approximately 30% of total offshore expenditures and deep water reservoirs are providing significant challenges to the industry, including increasing complex geology, sub-salt targets and high temperatures and pressures.  Halliburton enjoys leading deep water market share positions in cementing, completions and stimulation and a number two position in directional drilling and LWD and drilling fluids. Our suite of sand management technologies for deep water applications has been used effectively in a broad range of environmental conditions in the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Brazil. Our deep quest ultra deep water stimulation services have demonstrated proven benefits in high temperature and pressure environments.  We’re experiencing good commercial success in the introduction of other innovations, specifically sperry had an outstanding quarter for the insight ADR an azimuthal deep reading resistivity tool with successful jobs in seven countries including US, Brazil and Norway. Customers are finding significant advantages with the ADR as it provides new levels of control in the guidance of wells through the reservoir and removes the ambiguity regarding the steering of wells in the highest resistivity sweet spots in a wide range of offshore and onshore environments.  We are very pleased with customer acceptance and demand. Project visibility for our international markets is very good as are delivery schedules for rigs. Some 170 rigs are entering the market over the next four years and they’ll provide meaningful incremental revenue for the industry and given our strong market position for Halliburton. A word of caution in the modeling process though, material delays either in the delivery of the rigs or more importantly the functioning of full efficiency will temper the timing of expected growth which we now anticipate late in 2008 and into 2009.  In the interim, we continue to expect our international growth to be in the 20% range while margins may vary as they reflect costs associated with the major project startups. As many of you are aware, a press release regarding Halliburton’s interest in acquiring Expro was issued last week. We’re in discussions with the company and currently performing due diligence which may or may not lead to an offer being made. We do not have additional details to provide today and would like to reiterate that any offer will be consistent with our previously espoused strategy of making acquisitions accretive to shareholder value. Dave.
David Lesar:  Thank you Tim. As we’ve indicated, our results this quarter are what we expected. I believe we’ve engineered a soft landing in a very tough pricing environment in North America. And now with our customers rethinking their drilling plans, we are poised to take advantage of any increased activity in this market. We think the pricing environment will continue to be competitive in the second quarter but are very well positioned with our leading technology and execution capabilities.  We are even more confident today that pricing will stabilize and that will occur earlier than we had previously anticipated. Internationally we are pleased with our performance with revenue growth rates above our target of 20% with sustainable operating margins. As we have discussed in our previous calls, Latin America will be our fastest growing region and the first quarter’s results bear this out. We recently saw two significant contract wins internationally, which is continuing evidence of the success of our growth strategy. Our outlook for Halliburton remains very favorable and we expect to see strong global demand for our products and services through the end of the decade. Let’s go ahead and open it up for questions now.
Operator:  (Operator instructions). Our first question comes from David Anderson of UBS.
David Anderson – UBS: Thank you. Tim you were just talking about the offshore sector and how it’s kind of poised to start to pick up in the end part of the year. Can you talk specifically about rotary steerable and your plans there? I guess if you could comment about how much capacity you have in these tools and kind of where you were last year and what you plan to do out over the next several years.
Tim Probert:  I think as we look back, clearly there has been some shortage in supply of rotary steerables into the industry causing some spot shortages in certain areas. I think as we look forward we’ve got very good visibility of the rigs that are arriving, where they’re going and I think that the industry is clearly ensuring that it’s going to supply the industry as required. So no I don’t see any particular challenges there in the delivery of rotary steerables. Of course, looking at the offshore sector, that is the highest usage sector for rotary steerables, very high indeed in fact. So we can expect to see them utilized very broadly in these new rigs that are arriving.
David Anderson – UBS: Is there any particular market that uses rotary steerable more like say the Gulf of Mexico at X percent versus I don’t know say like Australia at another percent?
Tim Probert:  I think any offshore environment where drilling is complex will use rotary steerables today.
David Anderson – UBS: Okay and then Dave outside North America you’ve talked about positioning yourself very well for the growth, your growth prospects, are there any regions that you expect to be reallocating capital towards this year in advance of 2009? In other words, are there any changes in your patterns that you foresee?
David Lesar:  I think Dave if you look at demand across the globe today outside the US, you know there’s increased demand essentially wherever you look. Obviously our business in Latin America is one that needs to have additional capital allocated to it, but we knew that coming into the year and that was part of our plan. So as Mark has indicated, our capital plan pretty much is on schedule and the capital is going to where we originally thought it would go.
David Anderson – UBS: Okay, so you don’t really see any kind of changes over the last couple years going forward then?
David Lesar:  I think you know if you look at a couple of the weak spots I mentioned, obviously we will continue to keep an eye on them. I think project delays and some difficulties attracting rigs and some weather issues in the North Sea is a place that we are keeping our eye on. And then I think with some of the issues around geopolitics and some of the financial stresses that we’re seeing. And Nigeria obviously is another area that we’re focused on. But I think you know as we’ve indicated in past calls, the focus for international capital build up is in Eastern hemisphere and focused on sperry and wire line and completion products.
David Anderson – UBS: Okay, that’s great and then one last question if you don’t mind. You were talking about some pricing pressures internationally, can you give a little bit of more specifics on those pricing pressures, what is that caused from? Is that just from your peers, is that smaller upstarts coming on the market and is there a particular region you’re seeing that in?
David Lesar:  No, I think the issue in the international market is that it’s a longer term contracting market. So you are essentially either in or out and can be in our out for a number of years. And that means that you have to get your initial bids right and have to get your foot in the door on some of these larger projects. And then you have a base of business to essentially build your market share and your operations in a particular country from that base. So it’s really the traditional larger service companies that we’re competing against. But I think as the stakes have gotten bigger and the projects have gotten bigger and longer, getting it right on the front end is very important.
David Anderson – UBS: Great, thank you very much.
Operator:  Thank you our next question comes from Charles Minervino of Goldman Sachs.
Charles Minervino – Goldman Sachs: Hi, good morning. Just had a question on, a couple questions on the Manifa announcement. First, was there really a specific technology competency that drove the award of that contract or was it more the group of services that you were offering?
Tim Probert:  With respect to Manifa, I think when you take a look at the components of technology, there is a broader range of technology which are utilized in the scope of the project. However, I think we have to say that by far the largest value relates to drilling and logging well drilling related activities.
Charles Minervino – Goldman Sachs: Okay and then I also noticed that the stimulation services are part of that contract, how critical was that in terms of the award of the contract? Was that a big component there as well?
Tim Probert:  It was a component but not a significant component compared to that of the sort of well construction activities, no.
Charles Minervino – Goldman Sachs: Okay and just a couple other questions on stimulation. Can you give us some color on how big offshore stimulation work is for you maybe as a percentage of total revenues or as a percentage of C&P revenues?
Tim Probert:  You know that’s not sort of a breakdown that we typically provide. What I can say is that you know really clearly the largest single component of our stimulation business is in North America. We operate on a global basis and in some cases that will be offshore and some cases it will be onshore. But you know the North America represents the largest single sort of concentration of activity.
Charles Minervino – Goldman Sachs: I guess what I’m trying to get at is you know are we going to see, is this a theme that we’re going to see going forward of more stimulation work where we see above average growth in the international markets from stimulation?
Tim Probert:  I think as we all know you know the sort of hydrocarbons are getting harder to find and they’re getting harder to extract and we certainly feel that stimulation technologies will be a very important feature of the portfolio going forward in all international markets, yeah.
Charles Minervino – Goldman Sachs: Great, thank you.
Operator:  Thank you our next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz of Citigroup.
Geoff Kieburtz – Citigroup:  I guess what I wanted to ask was whether you would talk at all about your, the reasons for your interest in Expro or whether we’re just going to skip that subject this morning?
David Lesar:  Geoff I think that if you’ve listened to our discussion about M&A activity over the past several years, we’ve said that we would look for niche acquisitions, geographic expansion outside the US and new potential product lines for Halliburton, all of which need to be accretive to the shareholders and I think Expro would fall into potentially a couple of those. But I don’t think it’s worth us debating it or discussing it on the call any further than that. We’ll obviously update all of you when we’ve made a conclusion on it.
Geoff Kieburtz – Citigroup:  I guess you touched on the one thing David, I was trying to understand as to whether, you know if something happened would Expro add a new business line to Halliburton?
Tim Probert:  Yes Geoff, it certainly would as I think you probably know, Expro is very well established in the flow management arena which is an area which really Halliburton does not participate significantly. So that’s clearly one of the attractions.
Geoff Kieburtz – Citigroup:  Okay, great. And Tim I’d like to come back on your comment about the revised estimate of the capacity additions in the stimulation market for North America. I think you said you know had though 10%, we’re now thinking 12-15%, the difference being capacity coming back into the market?
Tim Probert:  Yeah I think there are a couple of markets internationally Geoff clearly which are oversupplied, Russia is one of those for example. And we don’t think that with the North America market improving that it’s reasonable to assume that markets will remain oversupplied for a long period of time. In fact we’re actually moving the spread out of Russia into another international location in response to that.  With respect to capacity in North America in general, I think we feel that we want to keep you updated in terms of the changes which will help you understand what’s taking place in North America, we really don’t see that as being a significant move but nonetheless wanted to keep you posted so that you’re aware of our thoughts with respect to what it takes to continue to stabilize pricing in North America.
David Lesar:  Also Geoff I think it’s important to understand that a lot of this potential horsepower that we see being added to US is really with the new entrants of the smaller players, most of which we don’t compete against.
Geoff Kieburtz – Citigroup:  Okay. I guess what I found a little bit surprising and maybe there’s another consideration here but that with the US market apparently still in some degree of price erosion that it is, the market, the surpluses elsewhere are going to go to, it suggests there are no other stimulation market in the world that is stronger than the US. Is that correct or is there something else going on that…
David Lesar:  No I think Geoff, the issue is a lot of these folks that have put equipment into these what are now oversupplied markets, can’t access a lot of the other markets that are available outside the US. You know setting up in Algeria, going offshore West Africa, offshore Middle East, Australia, places like that. And also I think people have begun to get pretty excited about some of these new potential shale developments.  You’ve seen a lot in the press lately about the Marcellus shale so I think you’re seeing some people out to try to pre-position themselves in some of these up and coming shale plays to be able to take advantage of the opportunities as they come along. So don’t go away from this thinking that we see a dramatic overcapacity. As Tim said, what we see is that there is going to be enough demand in the US going forward to absorb the capacity and not have any material degradation on pricing.  But also I think it’s the natural way for new entrants or those that are at the little bit at the lower end of the technology curve to find the easiest to access markets. And as the US appears to now be popping up faster than people thought and Canada appears to be coming on maybe faster than people thought, I think it’s actually natural that people would look back to the US as a place to expand their capacity.
Geoff Kieburtz – Citigroup:  Okay, great, thank you.
Operator:  Thank you our next question comes from Scott Gill of Simmons.
Scott Gill – Simmons & Company: Yes, good morning. I guess Dave for you, earlier when someone asked about Expro you were talking about your rationale for making acquisitions. I was wondering if we could kind of talk a little bit about the land rig business, we’ve seen Weatherford leverage land rigs in Russia for IPM work and there’s a release out today that Schlumberger is looking at Saxon and can you talk a little bit about how you see land rigs potentially within Halliburton’s portfolio as it relates to future IPM work?
Tim Probert:  Obviously rigs are an important component of completing major integrated projects. Our preferred approach has been to develop relationships with key providers of rigs in order for us to have an opportunity to complete those jobs effectively. That’s worked very well for us to this point and to this point Scott we really don’t see changing that approach.
Scott Gill – Simmons & Company: Okay and then Tim lastly the question I have just following up on Geoff’s questioning, do you have any quantitative way to kind of capture frac intensity here in this US market? In other words if the rig count’s up 5%, is there some formula you use to kind of gauge how much of that overall frac business would be up?
Tim Probert:  Yeah we monitor that closely internally. I think what we told you on our last call was during the course of 2007 we thought that the amount of horsepower per job had gone up by about 10%. We expect that trend to continue, we’ll monitor it closely, we have one quarter’s worth of data this year under our belt. I think it’s probably a little bit premature at this moment to sort of make detailed projections. But suffice it to say that we continue to expect that trend to continue.
Scott Gill – Simmons & Company: Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Thank you our next question comes from Dan Pickering of Tudor Pickering Holt.
Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering Holt:  Good morning guys. Tim and Dave could you walk us through, coming back to the Expro question, I think we know mechanically that if Halliburton were to be successful in a bid you’ve got to pay more than the Candover guys by 12-13, 14%. That’s about $4 billion. Tell us how you think about $4 billion in an acquisition whether it be Expro or elsewhere on a return basis relative to share repurchase, buying back Halliburton stock.
Tim Probert:  Dan, we really don’t have any additional details to provide today on that particular proposed acquisition.
Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering Holt:  Okay how do you think about share repurchase relative to acquisition?
Mark McCollum:  Dan, this is Mark, I think as I’ve said in my earlier comments that we always, when we look at the use of our excess cash, you know evaluate closely the returns that could come back to our shareholders on acquisitions versus doing share repurchase and what’s the best use of our cash. And we’ll certainly factor the available cash that we have into any evaluation that we do on the Expro deal once we complete our due diligence and determine what the relative values are.
Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering Holt:  Okay, North Sea, you indicated you thought that the rest of the year might be slightly softer, is that a sale of products issue, is it a vessel utilization issue, what’s kind of the, what are the driving components of that commentary?
Tim Probert:  The UK sector in particular is a little bit of a challenge in terms of rig supply and is very susceptible to any sort of minor disruption. So it’s really kind of a commentary on the fact that until we get new rig deliveries finalized for the North Sea and you know a more aggressive activity scenario, we’re going to see an environment which is going to be somewhat muted.
Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering Holt:  Okay so Tim it’s not worse it’s just not better?
Tim Probert:  That’s correct.
Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering Holt:  Okay, thank you.
Operator:  Thank you our next question comes from Ole Storer of Morgan Stanley.
Ole Storer – Morgan Stanley:  Thank you very much. Just wanted to touch back on your international growth projections, you’re comfortably ahead of the targets that you set. Does it mean that you are implicitly lowering your year over year growth expectations for the rest of the year? Should we look at your guidance for the rest of the year in isolation of what happened in the first quarter?
David Lesar:  No I think that you know we have said for the past several years that we would expect to grow our international business over 20% over a period of two or three years and we certainly have hit that mark the last couple of years. And I think that we had a very good year over year increase in Q4 to Q1, so no we are not implicitly reducing our growth rates, it’s just that Q1 was a great start on the year. But we remain very excited about our opportunities in the international market and fully anticipate and believe that we could hit that long term plus 20% growth rate.
Ole Storer – Morgan Stanley:  So do you expect that 20% plus for the rest of the year?
Tim Probert:  I think the guidance we’ve given here is in the range of 20% and that’s probably as best as we can say on the call Ole.
Ole Storer – Morgan Stanley:  Okay, thank you. On North America, you highlighted that the 50% of your international activity offshore, what would that ratio be for North America?
Tim Probert:  Well North America is obviously going to be quite different. You know we’ve got a very large and robust onshore market in North America and obviously a fair amount of onshore activity in Latin America too. So don’t have numbers at my fingertips but significantly less offshore activity in the Western Hemisphere than the Eastern Hemisphere operations.
David Lesar:  Although if you think about the big offshore basins in North America, obviously it’s the Gulf of Mexico and we have a market leading position in the completions and production end of that business. And we also have a very good market share in the ever expanding offshore Brazil market.
Ole Storer – Morgan Stanley:  What percentage of North America revenue would roughly be represented by the Gulf of Mexico?
Tim Probert:  You know that’s just not data I have at my fingertips I’m afraid Ole.
Ole Storer – Morgan Stanley:  Okay. Just one follow up question on delays that you highlighted, is it just the North Sea where you are seeing a project delays because of scheduling as is on rigs or are you seeing it elsewhere as well?
Tim Probert:  I think it’s true to say that there are, really the market is very, very tight and you know projects are not necessarily always starting exactly on time as rigs may be delayed completing one program and moving to the next. Typically these things do take place, we normally factor them into our planning. However I have to say that probably we’re seeing a greater degree of delays today than we have typically seen, not just in the North Sea but also in Asia for example as well. So you know I think it’s just a feature of the environment that we’re going to be in until we see some significant new rig deliveries in late 2008 and into 2009.
Ole Storer – Morgan Stanley:  So does that mean that the project that you announced to have equipment ready for by your customers are getting postponed because of scheduling as is on rigs?
Tim Probert:  Well particularly on the well construction side you know equipment assets are still in relative short supply so those are very mobile assets and we’ll utilize them on a real time basis to make sure we maximize revenue opportunity.
Ole Storer – Morgan Stanley:  Okay well thank you very much.
Operator:  Thank you our next question comes from Jim Crandell of Lehman Brothers.
Jim Crandell – Lehman Brothers:  Good morning. Tim or Dave, you had hosted a dinner about a month back for one of the largest independent that operates in the shale plays and what he said was at least a little bit surprising to me that they didn’t use any of the big three pressure pumping companies, they considered these long multi stage fracs or commodity business and they basically knew as much about the business as the large pressure pumping companies and even represented that other companies felt the same way. Can you comment on what you feel is if there is any technology to add in these shale plays, it seems like activity is going pretty rapidly there and what you might be doing to try to change that perception?
Tim Probert:  Yeah I think I can I think one of the things that you’re hearing obviously is that there’s a significant increase in the water frac market and it’s growing, has been growing quite quickly as the shale plays are being developed. I think one of the issues that a number of our sort of enlightened customers see at least is that there’s a significant choking affect of the formation changes that take place which impedes the hydrocarbon flow following conventional water frac treatments.  And so it’s really important to ensure that you have a package of chemistry that really enables you to prolong that production potential. So we’ve certainly found we have a service we call it our aqua stem service in frac Jim, which is really used to overcome that effect. It’s got very good traction with our customer base and is used really quite broadly now.
Jim Crandell – Lehman Brothers:  Okay. And a follow up question on the stimulation business. We now have 12 or so maybe even more publicly held companies who probably can’t wait for the market to increase, at least the other nine that aren’t the big three so that they can start adding capacity again. If you look at yourselves as the market leader and figure that the three major companies have maybe lost 25-30 points of market share since 03, what’s your plan on how you might counteract this?
David Lesar:  Well I think Jim, a couple things, one, you know we do sort of command the technology heights with respect to the fracturing business and I think it’s continuing to bring out technology and process and it allows our customer to get the highest production at the lowest net cost for that production, which doesn’t mean necessarily that we’re the cheapest and in fact in many cases and we continue to see it in the rollovers of the contracts in Q1, we got work awarded to us where we were not the low bidder.  And so I think our customers do recognize the differentiated technologies, service quality, performance that they get from Halliburton and I think even the bigger service companies. So yes I think there will be more equipment in the business but we believe that every frac spread, every cementing unit, every piece of pressure pumping equipment that we can bring into the market, there’s a market there for that equipment.
Jim Crandell – Lehman Brothers:  Okay and one other topic it involves IPM. In particular here I’m referring to Menifa and the big job you won in Mexico, can you characterize pricing on those jobs and how competitive pricing is on the IPM work. Certainly you have some competitors that you’re bidding against in each one who are claiming that you’re very aggressive on pricing to get into the IPM business in these areas.
Tim Probert:  We have a very broad based project management, integrated project management business. We operating in nine or ten countries around the globe and have been doing so for a number of years Jim. So I think the number of companies that can offer and operate a well integrated project are very few. So no, I don’t feel that the pricing in those cases is particularly aggressive. With respect to general large international projects, our customers are obviously exercising their ability to put together large tranches of work and as Dave pointed out earlier, these in some cases give you the opportunity to be there for multiple years or not be there for multiple years.  And I think that large companies such as ourselves do a very good job particularly on the well construction side of introducing new technologies to our customers during the course of the contracts which gives us a very good opportunity to provide additional opportunities for them to improve efficiency and for us to improve margins.
David Lesar:  Yeah I think Jim just let me add one more thing and I think it’s an important aspect of the investment that we made a number of years ago in our global footprint because a large level of the cost on these bigger projects are logistical costs and footprint costs. And if you have a large project for a number of years you can set up your logistics in a way, you can set up your manufacturing staging and get the economies of scale from your local footprint that you wouldn’t otherwise be able to get.  And all that actually means your costs are lower than somehow who maybe is looking at going into a larger project doesn’t have that footprint and logistical capabilities. So just to reiterate what Tim said, you know not only do we have a strategy to grow our revenues at more than 20% a year, it’s at sustainable margins. And I think we’ve demonstrated over the past couple of years that we can continue to move our margins up and make them sustainable in the non-North America markets and get the growth rates we want. So I think that you know we have a model that we apply and I think it’s been successful and other companies have different situations and they have to play the hands, the cards that they got.
Jim Crandell – Lehman Brothers:  Okay, that’s a good answer Dave, that’s helpful, thank you.
Operator:  Thank you our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets: Good morning. I think you may have partially answered what I’m going to ask, I’m going to see if there’s a different tact here. I was a little bit confused, you referenced the fact that you said international margins were not peaking and then you referenced that there’s some element of pricing pressures on the international market as it relates to kind of giving these initial awards on these projects. And I’m just trying to see if you can help me connect the dots between what you just said about sustainable margins, margins not peaking and then having some interim issues on that margin front. 
David Lesar:  Yeah I think, you know, the focus that Wall Street, a lot of you on this call as well as all of us in the service industry put on these mega projects as they become available, I think by definition means that being successful on one is important to companies. And certainly it has been to us. So I think that attracts an element of price competition that maybe we hadn’t seen before. But I don’t see that as inconsistent at all about our ability to continue to grow the margins for reasons I talked about.  The longer term contracts give you better logistical support. It gives you lower manufacturing costs because you can feed your plants at the rate that you need it. You can leverage your economies of scale and the footprint in a particular country that you might be in.  And because you are on the contract you have the ability to up sell new technology as it becomes available. And so I think if you look at the [Carais] project for instance, we, that was a very competitive bid when it went in but as we have spent money on and developed new technologies that we’ve been able to offer to our customer, they have seen the benefit of that technology and are willing to pay for it. And by virtue of being on that project, we’ve been able to be successful in that and I don’t see any reason why that model can’t continue.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital Markets: Great, thank you.
Operator:  Thank you our next question comes from Brad Handler of Wachovia.
Brad Handler – Wachovia Capital Markets: Thanks, good morning guys. Could you please speak to a couple of the issues related to margin in North America in the next quarter or two? I guess you mentioned some steps you were taking to manage your costs, have you already implemented fuel surcharges, do you have any response back from customers about it?
David Lesar:  On the fuel surcharge, you know that’s obviously as diesel prices and all other sort of energy related prices have really kicked up in Q1, we are having those discussions with clients. I don’t think from a competitive standpoint it would behoove me to talk about the level of success we’ve had in getting our customers to pay for that. But I think that it will help mitigate the issue going forward. As Tim indicated and I indicated, you know we had a fair number of year old contracts rollover in Q1 and they essentially got some of the reduced pricing that we saw coming out of Q4.  But as Tim has indicated in his comments, some of the latter price increases or price negotiations that we’ve been having, sort of within the last week or two would indicate that that has started to stabilize and moderate. And outside of the fracturing business has in fact stabilized and in some places we’re seeing and being able to get some price increases as this point in time. So I think that we’ll see maybe one more quarter of sort of compression on the margins due to another full quarter with the new pricing that came out of Q4 last year plus some of the rollover pricing from Q1. But in the back half of the year we would expect to have seen it stabilize or maybe even increase at that point.
Christian Garcia:  Okay we’ll take one more question.
Operator:  Thank you our final question comes from Michael LaMotte of J.P. Morgan.
Michael LaMotte – J.P. Morgan: Thanks for squeezing me in. If I could get to the capacity question again on pumping, can one of you tell me what the payback looks like now on new build equipment? Are we still looking at about plus or minus eight years? Cash on cash return.
Tim Probert:  Let me just talk about that, I think there is one fundamental assumption that you have to make in any payback equation and that is the utilization of your equipment. And clearly you know there are a wide variety of utilization factors which are being experienced in the industry at the moment. So clearly it’s a business which we like, it’s one which is very profitable for us. But it’s one also in which we have very high levels of utilization. I think the anecdotal evidence is is that that is not uniform across the industry. So really just want to sort of introduce that fact to you in terms of the analysis of any payback. 
David Lesar:  Yeah I think Mike, just to give you a ballpark estimate, obviously we’re not going to give you exact numbers, where I think the in pressure pumping maybe the cash on cash payback in the industry is probably in the seven to nine year category that you put. Ours is actually in the two to three year payback because of the more aggressive utilization we have on our equipment.
Michael LaMotte – J.P. Morgan: Okay, I guess where I’m going with the line of questioning is, you know while we’re all encouraged to hear about sort of the bottoming out of margins and pricing, what is it that’s going to get actually you know prices to increase over the next two, four, six quarters in that business? Is it technology penetration? It’s just not sort of asset inflation two to three year payback is great, what’s to really push the margins higher in pumping?
Tim Probert:  I think you’re going to see a suite of new products, new technologies which will assist our customers in the development of these new shale plays. So technology is going to be a key factor. And clearly the delivery and the execution is also a key factor. You know completion efficiency is very important to our customers and you know the anecdotal information is is that completion efficiency for a large segment of the industry is rather low. So the combination of technology, the ability to execute and deliver high completion efficiency numbers are going to be the key to delivering price increments in the course of the balance of 2008 and into 2009.
Michael LaMotte – J.P. Morgan: Okay and then if I could squeeze in one more on sperry, with the tightness in the D&M market with growth in horizontal both domestically with shale and overseas, is it possible that and I can throw in a third, you’re obviously sort of the richness of the technology portfolio now within sperry, is it possible that that business line really becomes the principle driver over the next 12 months of incremental earnings?
David Lesar:  I think the, it’s a great observation, certainly outside North America or outside the US market, it clearly is going to be the driver of revenue for us because of the footprint, the reputation and the technology portfolio that sperry has. And of course the other reason is is a lot of the incremental revenue going forward are going to come from these new rigs which a lot of the revenues streamed to the service industry is going to come from the drilling and evaluation side first before it moves into the completion and production side where we also have great opportunities. But I think it should be sperry led or certainly drilling and evaluation led as we look out over the next couple of years.
Michael LaMotte – J.P. Morgan: That’s helpful, thanks guys.
Christian Garcia:  Okay, let’s close up the call. Thank you everyone for participating.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference, this concludes the program, you may all disconnect. Thank you and have a nice day.

Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. If anyone should require assistance during the conference, please press star then zero on your touchtone telephone. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Mr. Christian Garcia, you may begin.
Christian Garcia:  Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton fourth quarter 2007 conference call. Today’s c all is being webcast and the replay will be available on Halliburton’s website for seven days. A podcast download will also be available. The press release announcing the fourth quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO, Mark McCollum, CFO and Tim Probert, Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development. In today’s call Dave will provide opening remarks, Mark will discuss our overall financial performance, followed by Tim who will provide comments on our operations and business outlook. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks.  Before turning the call over to Dave I’d like to remind our audience that some of today’s comments may include forward looking statements reflecting Halliburton’s views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involved risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s form 10K for the year ended December 31, 2006, our form 10Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 and recent current reports on form 8K. In addition, please refer to the table in the Halliburton press release that reconciles past reported results to adjusted results for the non GAAP disclosure. Now I’ll turn the call over to Dave. Dave.
Dave Lesar:  Thank you Christian and good morning everyone. As usual we have a lot of moving pieces to discuss this morning. Let me begin with a few highlights from our results for the year before discussing our fourth quarter performance. For 2007, our total revenues grew 18% to a record level of $15.3 billion with all product lines registering double digit growth. The western hemisphere grew 12% to almost $9 billion and was hampered by year over year declines in Canada.  Overall we had a good performance given a challenging environment in North America. Consistent with our strategy, the eastern hemisphere grew 27% in 2007 to over $6 billion in revenue. In the year we focused our investments and resources into growing targeted geographies and our results reflect the successful execution of this strategy. More importantly, in the fourth quarter the eastern hemisphere is now over 43% of our revenue and 55% of our revenue is now from outside North America. We of course still value our North America franchise, but these results exhibit and improving global balance in our portfolio.  For the fourth quarter, total revenue reached a record $4.2 billion which represents a sequential increase of 6% compared to the third quarter. Operating income was essentially flat from the third quarter due to the impact of two special items, a $34 million impairment charge associated with a legacy oil and gas property in Bangladesh and $12 million of executive separation costs. Mark will provide more details regarding these items.  The strong sequential revenue growth in the quarter was led by our eastern hemisphere business. Eastern hemisphere revenues for the quarter grew an impressive 12% sequentially which is evidence of the success of our continuing investments in infrastructure, people and capital. Operating income did not grow as fast as revenue as the revenue increase in the eastern hemisphere. This is due to the fact and the impact of the impairment charge from the oil and gas property and other costs that we incurred associated with our continued ramp up of our eastern hemisphere infrastructure, such as facilities, training, technology deployment and of course adding and hiring people. Excluding the impairment charge for the oil and gas property, eastern hemisphere margins were nearly 23% in Q4.  Now turning to North America where I know there’s a lot of interest. Revenue grew 1% sequentially as we saw recovering in the Gulf coast and modest seasonal increase in Canadian activity. However, our Canadian business is down year over year and we are not planning on a recovery in Canada in 2008. Our US land revenue was impacted by normal seasonal drilling restrictions on our customers and also our customers extending the holiday season on the Rockies, both of which had an impact on our fracturing business.  Also in the late fourth quarter and even into the early first quarter, due to weather delays and pipeline access issues, a number of our customers delayed the completing and fracturing of a number of wells that they had already drilled. For example, one of our largest customers in the Rockies delayed completing and fracing over 100 wells that we are now starting to service in the late first and second quarters of 2008.  We saw price declines for our frac service in the fourth quarter in the low to mid single digits which were consistent with our expectations discussed in the third quarter conference call. The effects of the winter season and price declines have largely been offset by the growth of sperry and our drill bits businesses. Consistent with our strategy, we are focused on balancing our US operations by capitalizing on the trend toward more horizontal drilling. Tim will talk about this in a bit.  Now let me talk about the results of the contract rollover process for our US fracturing business in the fourth quarter and the impact this will have for the first quarter in 2008. We have successfully renegotiated all contracts that were up for renewal in Q4. Our US land fracturing work is now a little over 70% under contract for 2008. In the fourth quarter rollovers represented about half of that business. The remaining contracts will rollover in the first half of 2008.  Given the price erosion that we saw in the transactional market, we have concentrated on matching our equipment with our customer’s major assets that fall under longer term contracts where we expect to receive better utilization in margins. For the contracts we rolled over in the fourth quarter, we believe we grew our market share with these customers and in some cases where we were unsuccessful retaining the work, we have now been contacted by some customers to see if we can serve them again.  But based on the price levels that were negotiated, we anticipate seeing an average price decline for US land fracturing work in the mid to upper single digits for the first quarter of 2008 relative to the fourth quarter of 2007. However asset utilization for our fracing equipment remains very high as we continue to see increasing demand for our customer given the secular trend towards production from unconventional plays. This has translated to higher service intensity and we believe this will continue to drive volume increases in the technologically driven segment of the market, even if national gas prices only support a flat rig environment.  This trend coupled with signs of decelerating capital additions indicates to us that pricing should stabilize sometime in the second half of the year, although we may possibly see some additional pricing deterioration of a couple percentage points in the early part of 2008. We’ve discussed in the previous call that we have been seeing pricing declines in other service lines like cementing, wire-line and drilling fluids. These declines continued to be modest relative to what we’ve experienced in our fracturing business. We believe our ability to offer multiple product lines to our customers helps to mitigate the impact of pricing pressures on our frac business. Now let me turn the call over to Mark and he’ll give a few more highlights.
Mark McCollum:  Thanks Dave. I’ll be comparing our fourth quarter results sequentially to the third quarter. Halliburton’s revenue in the fourth quarter was $4.2 billion, up $251 million or 6% from the third quarter. All regions and both divisions posted revenue increases led by strength in the Middle East and Europe. Operating income decreased by only $3 million from the third quarter. Remember fourth quarter operating income included charges for the oil and gas impairment and executive separation costs and third quarter operating income included $32 million in charges for environmental matters.  Operating income margins declined by 150 basis points in part due to these special items but also due to seasonal slowdowns and price declines in our US fracturing business. Now I’ll highlight the segment results. Completion and production revenue increased $102 million or 5% from the third quarter, while operating income declined $25 million or 4% from the third quarter. Completion and production’s revenue growth came from both completion tools and cementing while the production enhancement product line saw relatively flat revenue quarter over quarter.  Looking at completion and production on a geographic basis, the Europe Africa CIS region posted a revenue increase of 16% but a 2% decrease in operating income. Completion tools saw increased revenue throughout the region, including strong demand for our intelligent well completion services, but they experienced less favorable product mix in Africa. Production enhancement benefitted from improved stimulation vessel utilization in both the North Sea and Africa and strong activity in the Caspian. In the Middle East Asia region, completion and production revenue improved 13% and operating income improved 18% over the third quarter.  Our completion tools product line benefitted from increased well dynamics shipments. Production enhancement also improved activity in both Saudi Arabia and Oman. In North America, completion and production revenue declined 2% and operating income fell 13%. As Dave mentioned, US results were affected primarily by seasonality but also by declines in the US land fracturing pricing. This was partially offset by better activity for both cementing and production enhancement in the Gulf of Mexico and increased production enhancement activity in Canada.  In Latin America, completion and production revenue increased 6% and operating income increased by 41%, despite the negative impact of the floods in Mexico. Completion tools had a strong increase in Brazil as it began work under its recent four year contract award providing testing services to Petrobras in high pressure, high temperature and deep water environments. Cementing experienced improved activity throughout the region, especially in Mexico. In our drilling and evaluation division, revenue increased $149 million or 9% and operating income increased $31 million or 8% over the third quarter.  Wire-line and perforating, landmark and security DBS contributed meaningfully to the fourth quarter income growth. Baroids fourth quarter results also improved as the third quarter was negatively impacted by a $24 million environmental charge. Operating income for sperry was negatively impacted by increased startup costs for new projects and a less favorable product mix. We expect to return the growth trend in sperry’s profitability in the first quarter. In the Europe Africa CIS region, drilling and evaluation revenue improved by 12% while operating income was essentially flat. Revenue growth was driven by wire-line and baroid activity in Europe and increased landmark activity throughout the region.  As previously mentioned, operating income was negatively impacted by increased startup costs for new projects for sperry and a less favorable product mix. Drilling and evaluation revenue in the Middle East Asia region improved by 7% and operating income was negatively impacted by the $34 million impairment charges. These charges were related to our 25% non-operating interest in the [magnima] prospect located in Bangladesh where drilling activity resulted in a dry hole in December. In addition to this prospect, the operator is currently drilling a well in the adjacent [hotia] field. We expect to know the results of the [hotia] drilling activity by the end of the first quarter and depending on the results, we could incur and additional impairment charge.  Operationally, landmark experienced its traditionally strong fourth quarter performance throughout the region. Wire-line had improved Middle East activity during the fourth quarter and security experienced higher sales volumes in Asia Pacific. In North America, drilling and evaluation revenues increased 7% and operating income increased by 47% as compared to the third quarter. Increased operating income was the result of the exceptional performance from sperry, security and landmark in the United States and improved profitability for baroid following the third quarter which was negatively impacted by the environmental charge.  The US continues to see strong performance across the product lines. Canada also experienced some quarter over quarter revenue improvement within this division as compared to the third quarter, driven by activity growth for both baroid and wire-line. Drilling and evaluations Latin America revenue improved 8% and operarting income improved 4% from the third quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by seasonally strong landmark sales and services throughout Latin America and wire-line with solid performance in Mexico, Columbia and Argentina. These improvements were partially offset by lower activity for baroid in Venezuela and Mexico.  Now I’ll address some additional financial items. Corporate expenses for the fourth quarter were $67 million which included approximately $12 million of executive separation cost. The fourth quarter effective tax rate for continuing operations was 24%. Our tax rate decline throughout 2007 as our international operations continues to make up a greater percentage of our operating income quarter after quarter. Our fourth quarter rate was also favorably impacted by foreign tax credits that we had not previously thought could be fully utilized.  During the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 2 million common shares at an average price of $36.26 per share for a total cost of $67 million. Since the inception of the repurchase program in 2006, we have repurchased 79 million shares at a total cost of $2.7 billion or an average share price of $33.91. We currently have $2.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In the second half of the year, we slowed the pace of our repurchases partly in response to an increase in potential acquisitions opportunities and improved valuations.  We will continue to re-evaluate the allocation of our cash between acquisitions and stock buybacks as market conditions change in order to provide good return for our shareholders. Given our stock’s current trading range, we anticipate increasing the pace of our repurchases in the first quarter of 2008. I’d also like to provide some financial guidance related to 2008. We anticipate that corporate expenses will range between $65-$67 million per quarter during 2008.  We currently expect the normalized 2008 effective tax rate to fall in the range of 30-32% as the percentage of our international earnings continues to increase. Additionally, we have the opportunity to benefit additional prior year foreign tax credits as our international earnings grow and we can support the recognition of these credits. This could cause our 2008 effective tax rate to be even lower. We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $170-$175 million per quarter or about $700 million during 2008. And finally our capital expenditures should remain in the range of $1.7-$1.8 billion for the full year. Tim.
Tim Probert:  Thanks Mark and good morning everyone. Dave provided some insights into North America but let me add a few more thoughts on the secular trends that have positive overtones for our business. The industry saw over 35% growth in rigs used in horizontal drilling in 2007. Our customers are increasingly using multiple zone completions which have led to larger frac jobs, not only for these horizontal wells but also for an increasing number of vertical tight gas completions.  Production responses have dictated more stages, higher horse power and larger volumes. Overall our horsepower for frac jobbing increase in excess of 10% in 2007 with a corresponding increase in revenue for well. These factors give us some confidence that were signs of capacity additions abating and modest activity increases. Pricing will stabilize in the second half of the year. In addition we’ve seen success in our one Halliburton strategy to create an attractive efficiency model for our customers in the development of their large assets.  For example, during this quarter we signed another sizable agreement with a major client in the [Pyonce] Basin to provide fracturing, cementing, completions and drilling fluid services, leveraged by our reservoir expertise. Growth in horizontal wells has afforded an opportunity to balance our portfolio in the US. A significant contributor to sperry’s growth has been the success of their electro-magnetic telemetry system which continues to set records for depths of operation and reliability.  We expect sperry’s growth trend to continue in 2008 as we build critical mass with our easy pilot rotary steering device and our new vertical drilling tool, V-pilot. Both designed to expand the penetration of rotary steerables in less complex land environments. The growth of our completions business in the US was also favorable. New technologies such as our versaflex expandable liner, easywell swell packet technology and delta stim sleeves are helping to drive more cost effective horizontal well completions.  We are of course pleased with the growth of our international business and there are several contributors which will be important for our long term outlook. Our intelligent well completions joint venture, well dynamics, completed a large number of deliveries in the fourth quarter. Well dynamics continues its leadership position in this business with revenue growing by 60% in 2007. Intelligent well completions systems enable our customers to change flow characteristics of a well while minimizing interventions and production downtime. We’re seeing great demand for these systems on land in the Middle East and in offshore markets in the North Sea and West Africa.  We see this as a continued growth area for us. Our global expertise in deep water was demonstrated in our involvement in the Tupi field in Brazil, which is one of the largest finds in deep water history. Halliburton has worked with Petrobras on this field since 2003 in developing the plan the involved drilling through the massive salt formation that sits atop this reservoir. Our involvement included supplying seismic interpretation and subsurface visualization software, directional drilling and drill bits in both salt and pre-salt zones, LWD wire-line well testing and fluids sampling and high collapse casing accessories.  Halliburton’s contribution was instrumental to the success of this very important project. In 2007 we experienced supply chain constraints related to drilling, evaluation and completions tools. We made first deliveries in the fourth quarter from two major manufacturing facilities in Malaysia and Singapore, further enhancing our ability to grow in the eastern hemisphere. Let me share with you some of our expectations for the first quarter and total year 2008.  In addition to the pricing impact in our US frac business, it’s appropriate to remind everyone that the company’s results for the first quarter will be subject to the same types of seasonality we’ve seen in previous years. The landmark and completions businesses fall off in the first quarter as they benefit historically in the fourth quarter from customer’s year end budgets. As an example, landmark’s seasonal decline in the first quarter of 2007 was approximately $50 million in revenue. Additionally, our businesses will be impacted by weather related seasonality that occurs in the Rockies, North Sea and Russia this time of year.  We see these declines as typical for our business, following the same pattern experienced in previous years. The short term outlook for North America has become a little more challenging to interpret. Consensus commodity levels will support modest increases in rig activity. The secular trends towards horizontal drilling and the high service intensity for our stimulation business coupled with some degree of rig and service deflation may well stimulate growth in the second half. Internationally, project visibility remains very good and paints a positive growth outlook for this business.  The trend towards exploration and exploitation of more complex reservoirs bodes well for our portfolio mix and degree of service intensity on a per rig basis. The waiting of floating and jack up deliveries towards the second half of 2008 has prompted some discussion regarding potential project delays. This may temper the industry’s growth for the year, however this scenario simply points to a very strong outlook for 2009. We think a reasonable growth rate for our international business in 2008 is in the 20% range. Dave.
Dave Lesar:  Thanks Tim. So let me summarize where we believe we are. In the eastern hemisphere we had great sequential revenue growth of 12%, annual revenue growth of 27%. Our investment in the eastern hemisphere product lines will continue. Eastern hemisphere margins are now consistently in the 20% plus range and as Tim said, we expect we will continue to follow our strategy of growing the eastern hemisphere in the 20% range and that should continue. In the western hemisphere, we see a more challenging environment, but I believe that we have the top industry management team in the western hemisphere and they will get us through it.  Fracturing margins declined by the low mid to single digits in Q4 in line with what we said. We have maintained or grown market share in the frac contract rollover process. Most of our 2008 frac work will be on a contract basis as that market gives us the better returns than we see in the transaction market which we believe is giving insufficient returns today.  Fracturing margins will decline by the mid to high single digits from Q4 to Q1 but we believe that pricing will stabilize in the second half of 2008 and if customers drill at the level that they have indicated to us, we may in fact experience growth in the second half of the year. So 2007 was a successful year as we executed our strategy of growing the eastern hemisphere while maintaining our strong US position amidst a tough pricing environment.   I want to thank all of our employees around the world for this achievement. In 2008 we will continue to grow our already strong position in the international market while optimizing our position in the US. We strongly believe in the longevity of the current cycle and the long term structural trends favor our company’s expertise in well construction and production technologies. With that, lets open it up for questions.
Operator:  Thank you. If you have a question at this time, please press the one key on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the pound key. And our first question comes from Jim Crandell from Lehman Brothers.
Jim Crandell – Lehman Brothers:  Hi good morning. Dave you just announced a large Mexican IPM win, can you comment on the performance of the IPMs you’ve been involved in to date, how you see it growing as part of your business and your expectations for margins for IPM jobs relative to other parts of your business.
Dave Lesar:  Hey Jim I’ll let Tim handle that one.
Tim Probert:  Good morning Jim. I think the first point is that this particular award has not actually started, it will be starting during the latter part of this month and early February. You know the project management activities for us have always been an important feature of our business but I think it’s true to say that we kind of deemphasized them somewhat at a time when we were really struggling to keep up with our supply chain to provide activities to all our key customers around the globe.  However, looking forward we really do see it as an important component of our business and with sort of a potential bid award list of some $3 billion just in Latin America alone over the course of the next 12-18 months, it’s clearly an important one to focus on. In terms of service work related to IPM, there’s sort of a combination of service work and pass through and that ranges from anywhere from sort of 10% to about 40% of the total revenue base and clearly with that pass through revenue towards the lower end of that range, we’re pretty comfortable that we can maintain our margins consistent with that typical of our normal service work.
Jim Crandell – Lehman Brothers:  Okay and one quick follow up Tim if I could. Could you talk to the market penetration and performance of your deep reading resistivity measurement you’ve introduced last year?
Tim Probert:  Yeah we’re really pleased with our deep reading resistivity measurement, we call it ADR and it continues to make good inroads into the market and we continue to build our fleet of tools to take advantage of the core from our customer base.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz from Citigroup.
Geoff Kieburtz – Citigroup:  Morning. Hello? Okay, yeah can we come back to the outlook for international growth? I think Tim you phrased it as international growth of 20%. Can you give us any breakdown there? Latin America versus eastern hemisphere and maybe also give us some idea of what your expectations are for incremental margins as compared to what you achieved in ’07?
Tim Probert:  I think that first of all, as we look around the globe, all of our international regions have some particularly positive outlooks for growth. Latin America looks like it’s going to be particularly strong in 2008 so we’re looking for good things there. Obviously part of that is going to be driven by the large integrated project management work which we’ve just received in Mexico. So really good outlooks around the globe for us. In terms of incremental margins, clearly we would expect to have incremental margins above the rate of growth of our revenues so north of 20%.
Geoff Kieburtz – Citigroup:  So, better than 20% incremental, stronger than 20% growth in Latin America, maybe a little bit less in eastern hemisphere and what would you expect at this point ’09 might look like relative to ’08?
Tim Probert:  Well you know I think one of the things that we can say about our business is that we do have a strong offshore drive to our business and when you look at the redeliveries which are anticipated, new rig deliveries or refurbs for that matter coming into the market in late 2008 and 2009, I think the 2009 really has the potential at this stage at least to be stronger than 2008.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Ken Still from Credit Suisse.
Ken Still – Credit Suisse:  Good morning guys. Wanted to ask about the share buyback, it was surprisingly small this quarter, fairly small last quarter, I was interested though in your comment that there may be I guess opportunities to buy things and then just generally, it seems like you guys are a little bit price sensitive on using the share buyback money to purchase shares. Could you talk about your philosophy there?
Mark McCollum:  Well I think as we said in our comments, we did back down the pace of our repurchases in the second half of the year. We did as the year went on, the number of acquisition opportunities that went into our M&A funnel, as we’re evaluating this, did increase and the valuations on those improved dramatically as private equity became a less significant player in the M&A market and our industry. So as we were, and of course Chris in front of me, were evaluating the various opportunities, we felt like that holding our cash back in order to potentially take advantage of those opportunities was a wise and better investment for us.  As we look forward into this year, particularly as our stock prices have fallen but also as we look ahead at some of the other financial activities that we’ll have this year, we think that it’s appropriate to be back in the market, be a bit more aggressive in terms of our share repurchases. So you should expect us to be back in the market repurchasing our shares very soon.
Ken Still – Credit Suisse:  Can I get a follow up on the Mexican IPM project? Could you describe how that’s been, is that a turnkey project or is it more of a cost plus you know, how are you guys sharing the risk on that one with [Temex]?
Tim Probert:  Obviously to execute these projects one has to have an access to a complete suite of services and also to rigs themselves and Halliburton has made a conscious decision not to enter into the rig market. So for us to execute these contracts typically means for us to develop and alliance with a rig provider to enable us to execute the work. So no, they’re not on a turnkey basis for us.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley:  Yeah, thank you. Just again to follow up on the project management, could you give some sort of number on how large your project management business is as a percentage of the total floor in revenues and where you see it going on the two to three year view? Is this going to be an important change in your strategy to be more involved with these types of projects around the world?
Tim Probert:  We typically haven’t given backlog data for our project management activities so I’m really not in a position to give you that data but I could give you a couple of data points and really what’s driving our interest I think is the overall increase in opportunity and you know the opportunity seems to be increasing and as I mentioned before there’s something like $3 billion plus of opportunities in Latin America alone as we look forward into 2008 and the first part of 2009, so it stands to reason that as our supply chain really sort of catches up with our demand that we more aggressively pursue these projects. And so they will become an important feature of our business going forward.
Ole Slorer – Morgan Stanley:  And Tim I also have you down over the past few years to feel that you are in a good position to assess the risks of the projects that you are taking on.
Tim Probert:  It’s something that we have been active with for a number of years. This is certainly not an isolated contract at all Ole, so we’ve just perhaps not talked about it greatly but we believe we’ve built a cadre of expertise which will serve us very well in the execution of these jobs.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Dan Pickering from Tudor Pickering.
Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering:  Morning gentlemen, wanted to talk a little bit about the completion and production segment, specifically North America. Dave I wanted to clarify a comment that I heard you say, toward the end of your discussion you said pumping margins declined mid to high single digits, I just wanted to confirm that was pricing not margins correct?
Dave Lesar:  Dan, that was pricing and it was fracturing, not to include cementing.
Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering:  Okay, great and so cementing is not seeing the same type of pricing declines that you’re seeing in fracturing, correct?
Dave Lesar:  That is correct, it has seen some, like the other product lines are but much more modest than we’re seeing in frac.
Dan Pickering – Tudor Pickering:  Okay and then as we look at the sequential impact of the contract rollovers and the impact there on margin, I’m just trying to gauge, as I looked at Q3 to Q4, we lost about 370 basis points or so of margin in the North American completion and production segment, I mean my math is getting me to about the same magnitude of decline in Q1 versus Q4. Am I in the ballpark as I think about pricing mix, Canada, et cetera?
Dave Lesar:  I think, yeah Mark’s shaking his yes, so I guess that’s a pretty good ballpark Dan.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Mike Urban from Deutsche Bank.
Mike Urban – Deutsche Bank:  Wanted to kind of just get a more holistic view of North America overall because you certainly have a lot of different data points out there, frac pricing down, utilization up and other product lines doing well. Do you think as you look out over the course of the year and on kind of a combined company basis, obviously the margins coming down that’s just math, can you kind of hold the line on the contribution or the EBIT as you go through the year as all those things kind of offset or are we looking at a decline?
Dave Lesar:  I think it’s really difficult to say at this point in time because the second and third quarters tend to be a lot of where we make our money during the year. But I think that if you look at the math on the margin compression, it would be difficult to say you can get there. However, when I talk to customers and I listen to their drilling plans and what they expect to do during the year, you can come to a different sort of conclusion. So at this point in time as I’ve said in the comments, if the customers drill to the level they say they will, then I think that we have a chance of having a positive EBITDA contribution for the year but I think it’s really too early to tell at this point in time because it will take a lot of additional drilling and volume to make up for the margin declines that we know are going to be there.
Mike Urban – Deutsche Bank:  Okay and the follow up is, you mentioned an example of a successful bundling contract or agreement toward the end of last year, early this year, how much of an impact can we expect that to have? Is that an idea that you’re increasingly seeing customers be receptive to just given that the US market has traditionally been kind of an ala carte kind of market?
Dave Lesar:  Well you know we’re certainly seeing that they’re being receptive. Obviously it’s something we want to lead with and typically a customer will go out to bid on an ala carte basis and it is ourselves who are going and sort of bundling together a package of services to them. So it’s really more of sort of a push approach than it is a pull approach from our customers.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Scott Gill with Simmons & Company.
Scott Gill – Simmons & Company:  Yes, good morning gentlemen. Mark, I guess the first question in the area of capital spending, I think on the last quarter’s conference call the guidance for ’08 was $1.5-$1.7 billion and I think I heard you say now $1.7-$1.8, could you just give us some color as to why the increase? Is it just inflation or is it more projects? I’ll leave that open to you.
Mark McCollum:  Okay well I think it’s not really inflation so much as it is we just as we look ahead we see projects coming our way. The capital that’s going to be required to meet those projects is going up. We’re anticipating putting more capital into our drilling and evaluation division and particularly in our international markets, this Pemex award is an example where we will need some capital. And so, our outlook for our international growth is improving and that’s going to require tools on the ground.
Scott Gill – Simmons & Company:  Do you have a [overlay] between North American and non-North America on the ’08 spending?
Mark McCollum:  No we don’t.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Waqar Syed from Tristone Capital.
Waqar Syed – Tristone Capital:  Hi, I have a question on also the IPM project in Mexico. Could you guide us about how many rigs are involved in this project and will other rigs going to come in, are these incremental to Mexico or is it just shifting from one job to another?
Tim Probert: There’s about close to 60 wells in total that have to be drilled and that’s going to take I think approximately 17 rigs or something like that and some of the rigs are going to be indigenous already and some of them will be new.
Waqar Syed – Tristone Capital:  Okay. But all these rigs, are they already working or they are kind of idle do you know in Mexico?
Tim Probert: There’s really not a lot of idle fleet at the moment in Mexico so they will be transferred over from existing PMX activities.
Waqar Syed – Tristone Capital:  Okay, great, that’s all I have, thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Brad Handler with Wachovia.
Brad Handler – Wachovia:  Thanks, good morning. Could you please, let’s come back to the cap ex, then I have a follow up on the supply chain I guess. But in terms of that cap ex, just to clarify your comments, I think Mark you made them, how much is based in a sense kind of what you anticipate winning versus in a sense what you’ve already won and need to then deliver on for ’08?
Mark McCollum:  We always in doing our capital planning hold back a level of capital that we call sort of discretionary at the corporate level which is designed to anticipate potential projects that we might win during the year. And I would say a significant amount of the increase from our last guidance to this guidance relates to that discretionary capital as we see on projects that have yet to be awarded.
Brad Handler – Wachovia:  Okay, that’s helpful color, I appreciate it. The follow up is a little unrelated like I said, but well dynamics, you’ve mentioned this in the past as being sort of the supply chain I guess angst, you could correct my word if you don’t like it, but it sounded like maybe there’s some resolution on that. Can you just give us an update on where you stand there?
Tim Probert:  We have certainly commented on that previously and as always these things are a work in progress but we are very fortunate to have been able to transfer some talent over from Halliburton in the supply chain arena to assist with that process. So we believe that we’re seeing progress in that arena.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Doug Becker with Banc of America. Doug your line is open. Try un-muting your phone. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Natixis Bleichroeder 
Doug Read – Natixis Bleichroeder:  Good morning gentlemen. Following up on the international margins, you know 23% on a clean basis in the fourth quarter. Clearly expecting incremental at least I guess in that region given earlier comments. Can one of you talk to sort of a long term standpoint where you think international margins could go given a fairly positive outlook for 2009, can we see international margins sustain 25% or so or does the mix of projects, these IPMS, et cetera, say that maybe something in the lower to mid 20’s is the way to look at it?
Dave Lesar:  I think Roger the mid 20’s is certainly an achievable goal and something that we continue to shoot for. The opportunity environment in the eastern hemisphere is so strong today that we continue to have to expand our footprint and we have a large footprint out there but have to expand our facilities, the number of tools we have out there. We are hiring ahead of the demand that we see for the next several years so we’re bringing people on and we’re putting them into training and that always has a bit of a dampening effect on the margins. But given the customer reception to our technology and the desire for us to be involved in a big way in the eastern hemisphere in particular, I see nothing but sort of continued expansion opportunities there and I think that as long as we’re meeting the mid 20’s margins requirements and making the required capital investments, I’ll continue to do that all day long.
Doug Read – Natixis Bleichroeder:  Okay thanks and then on another margin question but a little bit different. The corporate expense, the guidance there is up quite a bit over where we saw it this year, I was just wondering if there was anything in particular directing that?
Mark McCollum:  I don’t know that there’s anything in particular driving that. If you recall earlier in 2007 we reclassified as we redid our segments, some additional expenses there that hadn’t historically been included in corporate, that is where we’re capturing some parts of our legacy cost when we deal with things like environmental cleanup or something like that. But I think that as you see we’re going to be investing some more in IT. This year we’re going to the next version of SAP, that’s going to drive some of the cost up, there will be some additional legal expenses that we’ll be incurring as we’re being more aggressive in protecting our intellectual property. It’s sort of across the board I think but not anything in particular.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Robin Shoemaker with Bear Stearns.
Robin Shoemaker – Bear Stearns:  Good morning. I wanted to probe Tim’s comment a little bit about the project delays or project slippage that was anticipated in 2006. I mean we immediately think of issues such as offshore rig availability, supply chain bottlenecks, funding of projects, what are the projects that you have in mind when you talk about delays and the principle causes.
Tim Probert:  Robin there has been quite a lot of chatter about project delays and to a certain extent these have been quite normal for our business and we take them within the normal scope of our business activity. However, we do have a significant number of rigs arriving, both jack ups and floaters over the course of the next couple of years. And in fact approximately 160 over the next three years or so and so they really do have a significant impact on the overall growth potential for the business, particularly since they represent a pretty high percentage of the overall offshore fleet out there today.  So delays can kind of come at the front end during the drilling phase and they can come at the back end when you’re trying to hook everything up and all we’re really just doing is I think just registering the fact that yes we do hear that there may be some potential delays and that there’s the potential that it could temper growth activities in 2008 if rigs are a little late arriving. But I think this just serves to strengthen 2009, 2010 and really sort of extend the overall cycle.
Robin Shoemaker – Bear Stearns:  One very short question, on tax rate guidance of 30-32%, is it possible that you have enough unused foreign tax credits that there is a scenario in which case it could be as low as the 26% that you had this year?
Mark McCollum:  Doing some quick math in my head. I think that the answer is yes, there is a scenario given the amounts that we have that it could be that low but I guess as we sit here today we don’t necessarily anticipate that. A large part of it is we’re going back in prior years because of the different tax laws, we have the ability to go further back in time to pickup foreign tax credits and as our business outlook changes, we can collect those but then you have to support that indeed you’ve got tax receipts and things that to evidence that indeed you deserve those credits and that’s part of the process that we have to go through to recognize them.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Alan Laws with Merrill Lynch.
Alan Laws – Merrill Lynch:  Good morning. Another question on the international side. How healthy would you say the international bid flow for projects looks right now say versus last year and are they increasing in size or are they about the same as they’ve been?
Tim Probert:  There’s a very significant visibility today to the major projects which are out there in the marketplace so I think probably at least as good as we’ve ever seen it so that’s really good news. I think it’s quite correct to say also that a number of these projects are very large in nature, they require significant scope to be able to execute them and I think it’s also true to say that a number of these are fairly keenly priced because they are so large. However, because of the duration of the projects and because they tend to be technologically driven, it really gives ample time during the scope and duration of the contract to add new technologies that improve margins into those projects to essentially improve the overall margin experience during the scope of the contract.
Alan Laws – Merrill Lynch:  Okay and I think it was Roger’s question on margins in the international arena, just as a clarification, were you saying that you were expecting them to remain in the sort of flat and to the 20-25% range closer to where your incrementals are I guess?
Tim Probert:  You know we’ve sort of just during the scope of 2008, you know in Q1 our margins were sort of in the 19% range moving up without the impairment charge into sort of the 23% range at the end of the year. So we’ve continued to steadily move our margins and we’ll continue to try to do that into the mid 20’s as Dave had suggested.
Alan Laws – Merrill Lynch:  But as you look forward, are you suggesting that these are kind of the right margins for your capital intensity of your businesses and building out people and infrastructure and that kind of thing?
Tim Probert:  You know we’re always trying to push our margins as well as we can. We’ll continue to sort of drive them upwards but I think we have to respect the fact that we are in a competitive environment and that there’s probably a rate at which they tend to slow down somewhat from the increases which we’ve seen.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital:  Hey good morning. Question I have for you is that you look at [unintelligible] growth rates at 20% for 2008. I was wondering if you could give us some general sense whether or not the ECA or Middle East, Far East, are they going to grow about the same, you think one will grow faster than the other and you know 20% could be anywhere between 20-30 obviously. Is it kind of 20-25 or 25-30 that you’re thinking for eastern hemisphere?
Tim Probert:  I think we captured that on an earlier question, you know basically we’re expecting Latin America to grow slightly higher than the norm and the balance of the eastern hemisphere to grow slightly lower than that norm that we stated. So that’s probably the best guidance that we can give you at the present.
Kurt Hallead – RBC Capital:  Okay so no further kind of differentiation between ECA and Middle East, Far East?
Tim Probert:  Not at this time, no.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Doug Becker with Banc of America.
Doug Becker – Banc of America: Thanks. Tim another IPM question. The prospects don’t look very good right now but wanted to get a little more color to gauge the contract risks, what type of cancellation provisions are normal, how often are you getting paid out of production, are there any regions that tend to have more favorable provisions?
Tim Probert:  You know there’s a great variety in these kinds of contracts and it really would be very difficult for me to kind of give you a generalization except to say that we really take the risk profile very, very seriously. Bear in mind that we have an opportunity to essentially put a bunch of our capital to work not in a completely risk free environment but in a relatively low risk environment today with the demand that we have in international markets, so we’re very cautious about the degree of risk which we take on and that’s the subject of obviously tough negotiations with our potential customers.
Doug Becker – Banc of America: And then just on the offshore markets, certainly gotten some discussion today, what percent of your revenues come from the offshore market and do you have any quantification of the potential impact in the new offshore rigs and what it might mean for Halliburton over the next several years?
Tim Probert:  Frankly I just can’t give you, because I don’t know, the percentage of our revenue that comes from offshore off the top of my head. But you know offshore does drive a significant amount of potential growth for us. In general we talk in terms of service intensity, an offshore rig is approximately 10 X the revenue and margin generation of an onshore rig in the US for example, so very, very important for us. And given our strong position in exploration in deep water, we’re obviously looking forward to those rigs arriving.
Operator:  Our next question comes from Rob Mackenzie with FBR.
Rob Mackenzie – FBR:  Thanks, question on the costs, I guess another way of thinking about incremental margins here guys, you had some pretty steep cost inflation year over year at least looking at fourth quarter numbers, recognizing there’s some moving parts obviously but how should we think about cost inflation going forward in 2008 and if you could break it down in terms of underlying core inflation in wages, materials and stuff, and separately startup costs and how we should think about that quarter on quarter going through the year.
Tim Probert:  Going to deal with the latter part first. We always have startup costs in most quarters during the course of the year, however occasionally we get to a situation where we have multiple startups in the same quarter and the effect is something that’s somewhat lumpy and we highlight it for you. So we expect a continuation of those as we move into markets which we feel that we under serve today. In terms of cost inflation, yes, the most significant element of cost inflation during the course of 2008 was frankly wage inflation. And that’s probably not going to slow down a whole lot. However the good news on wage inflation is that of all the discussions that we can have with our customers, wage inflation is the one which they are generally most sympathetic to since all our customers want access to the best people. So that’s probably the best guideline I can give you with respect to inflation.
Christian Garcia: Okay we’ll take one more question.
Operator:  Our final question comes from Ben Dell with Bernstein.
Ben Dell – Bernstein:  I had a couple of questions just on some of your international business. Obviously progress in Iraq seems to be moving forward with some of the majors. Room to be looking at some of the projects, if they went back in would you consider going back in, in a meaningful way? And also on the M&A market, you made some comments that seemed to be fairly bullish about looking at opportunities. Are there any specific products or regions you’re particularly interest in?
Dave Lesar:  I think it wouldn’t behoove us to tip our hat in terms of any direction we may be looking but it’s pretty clear that as valuations have come back and the private equity players have left the playing field that there’s a lot more attractive opportunities out there and it’s something that we’re taking a look at right now.  With respect to Iraq, clearly a number of our major customers are having some discussions about going back in there. There’s clearly still security issues around going in to doing service work there and that’s impacting all the major service companies today. But certainly if our major customers decided they can go in there and we could all feel comfortable that the security situation was such that we could work in there in a safe way, we certainly would go back in there with them.
Ben Dell – Bernstein:  Okay, thank you and just lastly on Angola. You didn’t make any comments around Block 31 timing or activity, do you have any follow up on that?
Tim Probert:  No just simply to say that Angola is an extremely important market for us. We feel that we have a very strong market position there and we’ll obviously try and exploit that as best we can as new discoveries and new developments are undertaken.
Christian Garcia: Okay we’d like to thank everyone for their participation in the call. Thank you.

Operator: Welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2007 earningsconference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce yourhost for today's conference, Ms. Evelyn Angelle, Vice President of InvestorRelations. Ma'am, you may begin.
Evelyn Angelle: Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton third quarter2007 earnings conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay willbe available on Halliburton's website for seven days. A podcast download willalso be available.  The press release announcing the third quarter results isavailable on the Halliburton website. You will note the press release reflectsa change to our segment reporting. We have recently undergone a corporaterestructuring as part of the separation of KBR.  We have reorganized the Energy Services operations into twodivisions: Completion and Production, and Drilling and Evaluation. Completionand Production includes our production enhancement, completion tools andcementing lines. Drilling and Evaluation includes all other product and servicelines including Sperry, Wireline and Perforating, Security DBS Drill Bits,Baroid, Landmark, and Project Management.  Beginning in the third quarter, our segment reporting hasbeen adjusted to reflect this organizational change. All prior periods havebeen restated. Our geographic structure reporting remains unchanged andincludes four regions: North America; Latin America; Europe/Africa/CIS; and Middle East/Asia. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, our CEO; Chris Gaut, ourCFO; and Andy Lane, ourCOO. In today's call, Dave will provide opening remarks, Chris will discuss ouroverall operating performance and financial position; followed by Andy who willhighlight some of our recent contract wins and technology successes. We willwelcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. Before turning the call over to Dave, I would like to remindour audience that some of today's comments may include forward-lookingstatements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and theirpotential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertaintiesthat could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual resultsto differ from our forward-looking statements.  These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for theyear ended December 31, 2006;our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007; and recent current reports on Form 8-K.  Now I'll turn the call over to Dave Lesar. 
David Lesar: Thank you, Evelyn and good morning, everyone. We continue tolook for operational efficiencies and cost management opportunities in how werun our business. Also, subsequent to the KBR separation, we evaluated ourmanagement structure to ensure our organization was properly aligned with ournew, singular focus on oil field services and to get our costs aligned with thepricing pressures we were beginning to see in North America. We have recently undergone an exercise to eliminateredundancies and streamline our operations by reorganizing our Energy Servicesoperations into the two divisions that Evelyn referenced. This structure willallow us to have greater cost efficiency and also allow our product lines towork together more effectively to market services and develop new technologies. Now let me talk a bit about the quarter. At Halliburton, ourtotal revenue increased 5% as compared to the second quarter and operatingincome increased 2%, but that includes the $32 million in environmentalcharges.  Our Eastern Hemisphere businesscontinues to do very well, as our recent capital investments in the Eastern Hemisphere are paying off. Sequentially, Eastern Hemisphere revenue grew 5% and our operating income improved 16%, resultingin 24% operating margin, a 220 basis point improvement from the second quarter.We expect the product lines driving future growth in the Eastern Hemisphere to be Sperry, our Wireline and Perforating andCompletion Tools business.  For example, both Sperry and Completion Tools showed revenuegrowth of around 30% during the first nine months of this year compared to thesame period last year, and the recent PSL Energy Services acquisition isproviding further Eastern Hemisphere expansion.  We are also increasing our manufacturing investment aroundthe world to bring new tools online to serve the high demand we are seeing forour services, opening new plants in Malaysiaand Singapore.Our outlook for the Eastern Hemisphere continues toremain very positive. Now let me provide you an update on the North Americanmarket. Overall in North American operations, revenue was up 6% and operatingincome was up 5% sequentially, as we experienced a rebound in Canadian activityand higher market share in pressure pumping, which more than offset the impactof losing two weeks of activity due to Gulf of Mexicostorms and some pricing declines in the U.S.land market.  More importantly for many of you, our U.S.land operations in the third quarter posted increases in both revenue andoperating income, as compared to the second quarter, while we maintained ourstrong operating margins of approximately 30%. Increased volume is drivingthese results, most significantly in the higher frac and cementing activity.During the third quarter, this increased demand for our services was enough tooffset pricing declines.  We noted last quarter that we were beginning to see pricingdeclines in our U.S.land frac operations. This has continued through the third quarter but we stillbelieve that U.S.land frac prices will decline less than 5% between July 1 and the end of theyear. We are seeing certain competitors bid for pressure pumping workaggressively in order to limit their market share degradation. This may resultin some spillover to our cementing prices, but not to the level we haveexperienced in frac operations. To offset this, we have been very aggressive inmanaging our cost and headcount. A key metric driving our profitability is how we utilize ourpressure pumping equipment. We continue to develop the most effective andefficient frac and cementing solutions and to deploy equipment in the mostefficient manner. Although these businesses are less significant for us now, weare also beginning to see U.S.land pricing pressures in other products like Baroid, Bits, and Wireline andPerforating.  U.S.land pricing declines will probably continue into the fourth quarter. We arecurrently bidding a significant amount of work with customers and are seeingthe potential for more pricing declines than we experienced in 2007, again ascompetitors seek to avoid market share degradation. Most of this impact wouldbe in pressure pumping; and if so, could start impacting us in the firstquarter. We'll be able to provide a more quantitative view on the impact ofpricing on 2008 operations during our fourth quarter conference call after allof these contracts are awarded, but I don't think it would be prudent todiscuss our bidding strategy on this call. However, looking ahead, our customers are telling us thatbased on current natural gas strip price that 2008 activity will actuallyincrease, both in the pressure pumping part of our business and on the drillingside, with more horizontal wells being drilled. So we expect continued growthin revenue and operating income for U.S.land in 2008, but we do think there may be some downside risk to our operatingmargins if pricing continues to erode or if natural gas prices declinesignificantly. In Canada,we experienced a seasonal recovery from the traditional slow second quarterspring breakup season. Our operating income increased, but we have not changedour outlook on Canada,and we're not planning on a significant recovery there. We are staying on top of the changes in the North Americanmarket. We're monitoring our customers’ activity levels and pricing behaviorand are making the appropriate adjustments to our business, including keeping aclose eye on cost, equipment deployment, and headcount. This proactivemanagement is reflected in the good margins we posted this quarter. With thisin mind, however, we are not under-investing in this long term market as we seecontinued need for oil field services in serving the four quality reservoirs inNorth America. We also mentioned last quarter that PEMEX is becoming a moresignificant customer for us. In Mexicoalone, we have recently been awarded projects totaling approximately $1billion. This work will be performed over the next three years beginning in thefirst quarter of 2008. You should look for expected growth in excess of 20% inour Latin America operations in 2008 led by Mexico,Brazil, Argentinaand Columbia.  Now let me turn the call over to Chris and he’ll give ussome more details.
Chris Gaut:  Thanks, Dave. Goodmorning. I will discuss our third quarter results compared sequentially to thesecond quarter. Halliburton's revenue in the third quarter was $3.9 billion,that's up $193 million or 5% from last quarter. All regions and both divisionsposted revenue increases, led by strength in Asia,improved activity in U.S.land, and a seasonal recovery in Canada. Operating performance improved significantly in the thirdquarter despite the second quarter $49 million gain on the sale of ourinvestment in Dresser Limited, and the $32 million third quarter charges forold environmental matters; our reported operating income still improved by $17million in the third quarter. Three of four regions in both divisions contributed to theoverall increase in operating income. We had very strong growth and performancefrom the Eastern Hemisphere, where operating incomeincreased by 16% from the second quarter. Operating margin in the third quarterwas 24%, as incremental margins over the second quarter in the Eastern Hemisphere were very high. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were$0.79. These results include a $133 million or $0.15 per diluted sharefavorable income tax impact from our ability to recognize U.S.foreign tax credits we previously assumed would not be fully benefited. We nowbelieve we can fully utilize these credits because of a taxable income growthfrom our international operations.  The fourth quarter tax rate will also be favorably impactedby our growing international operations. We expect the fourth quarter and 2008effective tax rate to be in the range of 31% to 33% due to the favorable mixshift of more international earnings. Now I will highlight the segment results, and as we now havetwo segments, I'll try to bring you more regional color on the individualsegment operations.  Completion and Production revenue increased $121 million or6% from last quarter and operating income grew $41 million, or 7% over thesecond quarter. Completion and Production’s growth was led by our productionenhancement product line where revenue increased 10% due to higher activity inthe U.S. andinternationally. Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis,the Europe/Africa/CIS region posted flat revenue but a 19% increase inoperating income. Completion Tools contributed to the increased profitabilitythrough more favorable product mix in West Africa.Production enhancement benefited from improved stimulation vessel utilizationin West Africa, as well as increased activity in Russiaand Egypt. Cementingbenefited from a stronger mix of high end services in the UK. In the Middle East/Asia region, Completion and Productionrevenue improved 21% and operating income improved 22% over the second quarter.Our success in penetrating markets like Indiais attributable to our strength in deepwater completion technology, includingsand control. In fact, we expect to more than double our revenue in Indiathis year as compared to 2006.  Our Completion Tools revenue tends to vary from quarter toquarter, and the third quarter had a high level of shipments to Asia.Production Enhancement had improved activity in Australiaand Southeast Asia, particularly for our premiere PinpointStimulation services. In North America, Completion andProduction revenue improved 6% and operating income improved 8%. U.S.results were driven by higher frac activity and to a lesser degree, cementingactivity, offset by the pricing pressures Dave spoke of. This division'srevenue was negatively impacted by third quarter storms in the Gulf of Mexico.  All three product lines in this division benefited from theseasonal improvement in Canadaas the second quarter was impacted by restricted activity due to the springbreakup season. In Canada,Completion and Production revenue improved in excess of 70% since the secondquarter.  In Latin America, Completion andProduction revenue was flat and operating income decreased by 32% due to anumber of discrete items this quarter. Storms in Mexiconegatively impacted third quarter results as they did in the Gulf of Mexico. Completion Tools had a drop in Latin American activity assome customers experienced project delays. Production enhancement incurredcosts related to bringing a new stimulation vessel online in Mexico,and was negatively impacted by a labor strike in Argentina.We do expect Latin America results to improve during thefourth quarter. In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue increased$72 million, or 4%, and operating income increased $24 million, or 7% over thesecond quarter. Both Sperry and Wireline contributed meaningful it to the thirdquarter growth while environmental charges negatively impacted Baroid's thirdquarter results. Of the $32 million in environmental charges recorded in thethird quarter, $24 million impacted Baroid, while the balance was reflected incorporate and other. In the Europe/Africa/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluationrevenue improved by 2% and operating income improved by 11%, driven byincreased Sperry Services in Russiaand the North Sea, and higher wireline and perforatingservices in the Caspian. Drilling and Evaluation revenues in the MiddleEast/Asia region improved by 6%, while operating income improved by 15%.Wireline and perforating had improved equipment deliveries into Asiaduring the third quarter. Baroid and Security DBS Drill Bits experienced highersales volumes in the Middle East. In North America, Drilling and Evaluation revenue increased6% but operating income decreased by 3% as compared to the second quarter. Herewe recorded a $24 million environmental-related charge related to a Dresser legacymatter. Also, the Gulf of Mexico storm seasoncontributed to the decrease in activity. The revenue impact of third quarterstorm activity in the Gulf of Mexico was approximately $12 million. Baroid wasimpacted most severely.  Looking ahead, Sperry continues to be positively impacted bythe increased amount of horizontal drilling that is occurring on U.S.land. In Canada,our Drilling and Evaluation segment experienced an improvement in revenue inexcess of 60%. Product lines that contributed most to this recovery includedSperry, Baroid, Wireline and Perforating and Security DBS. Drilling and evaluation Latin Americarevenue improved 3% and operating income improved 7% from the second quarter.This improvement was primarily driven by Wireline and Perforating serviceactivity and Baroid sales and services throughout Latin America,partially offset by the two hurricanes that hit Mexicoduring the third quarter. Now I will address some other financial items. Our minorityinterest expense was up in the third quarter to $18 million. That's due tohigher earnings for our partners’ interest in JVs in the Middle Eastand North Africa.  During the third quarter, we purchased approximately 11million shares of our stock at an average price of $33.71 per share, for atotal amount of $374 million. We currently have $2.4 billion remaining underour share re purchase authorization.  I would also like to provide some guidance related to 2008.We have not finalized our capital expenditure budget for 2008 but it willlikely be in the range of %1.5 billion to $1.7 billion for the full year, witha continuing shift towards international and to the Drilling and Evaluationdivision.  We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $170million to $175 million per quarter, orabout $700 million during 2008. 
Andy Lane: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. As Dave said, weremain optimistic about the outlook for the Eastern Hemisphere,led by improved project execution and new technology introductions. Our work inthe large Khurais project in Saudi Arabiacontinues to progress well and exceeds our customer’s expectations. We arecurrently significantly ahead of the original drilling schedule.  A large contributor to our success is the use of our newreal-time center in Saudi Arabiato continuously monitor the drilling of the wells and ensure optimal drillingefficiency with our Geo-Pilot tools. We believe we are now operating at thepeak of the contract. As Dave mentioned, consistent with the PEMEX strategy ofawarding larger integrated projects, we've recently been awarded two largecontracts totaling approximately $1 billion in Mexico.All product lines will be positively impacted by these awards but we are nottaking on rig time risk.  In addition to the large contract awards for CompletionTools we discussed in our last call, primarily sand control tools for offshore China,completion tools for Malaysia,and deepwater sand control completion for India,we've just been awarded another significant contract, this one in Indonesia.These recent contract wins will continue to drive growth for Completion Toolsin 2008 and beyond. As we discussed in previous quarters, growth in Russia isexpanding across multiple product lines. Revenue is up over 20% in the thirdquarter of 2007 as compared to the third quarter of 2006, with a 35% increasein operating margins when comparing these periods. Growth is coming primarilyfrom cementing, Sperry Drilling Services, Baroid, and stimulation. Our Russiarevenue will be in excess of $350 million in 2007. This represents a compoundannual growth rate of more than 25% since 2004. We expect our growth rate inRussia to remain above 20% over the next several years. Libya is another market where we are experiencingsubstantial growth. Year-to-date, we have seen our revenues almost double ascompared to 2006 and an even better improvement in operating income. Both ofour divisions are fueling these results and we anticipate continued growth hereas we move forward.  Last quarter, we talked about the successful launch of ournew Pilot fleet of drilling systems at Sperry, including the enhanced Geo-Pilot,the V-Pilot and EZ-Pilot tools. This quarter I'm pleased to announce the verysuccessful launch of our new InSite Generation of LWD Tools. This newgeneration of LWD provides unprecedented insights to our customers’ reservoirs,to maximize reservoir contact and ultimately, recoverable reserves, byproviding deeper reading measurements, higher resolution imaging, fastertelemetry, and greater reliability. To date, we have commercially launched twonew services that can be run in combination with our new InSite IXO Interfaceto Grant Prideco’s IntelliPipe high speed wire pipe communications. The first service is InSite ADR, Azimuthally DeepResistivity. This service reads up to 18 feet into the surrounding formations, allowing for real-timegeo-steering to locate and stay in the most productive part of the reservoir. Itcombines these features with compensated dual resistivity measurement into asingle tool. We are seeing significant demand for this service.  The second new service is InSite AFR, Azimuthally FocusedResistivity. This service provides high resolution imaging while drilling,illuminating structural and stratographic detail. Recently, a major operator inthe Middle East has qualified this sensor as areplacement for wireline imaging tools, allowing them to make real-timedecisions and save valuable rig time. We have an aggressive manufacturing buildschedule for these new LWD Tools. I'd like to mention one additional product that has beenexperiencing strong, worldwide customer demand due to increasing requirementsfor hole enlargement operations, our XR reamer. This tool is capable ofsimultaneously drilling and enlarging the pilot hole by more than 44%. Itfeatures activation and deactivation capabilities, ultra stabilizationtechnology for smooth drilling, and a high density cutting structure for added durability.We've had more than 40 runs in the harsh North Seaenvironment, enlarging more than 133,000 feet since January of this year. In August, we opened the Edgar Ortiz real-time center in Houston.The center is a 13,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility that bringsexperts from Halliburton and our customers together in a real-time,collaborative environment to model, measure and optimize our customers’ assets.It allows geoscientists and engineers to -- among other things -- optimizedrilling programs through our Drill to the Earth model workflow, which isdesigned to integrate data such as generated from the ADR and AFR tools into apowerful visualization environment that enables a more precise understandingand adjustments to well pass and the underlying earth model. This is all a partof what we refer to as the digital assets. These are just a few examples of new products we'veintroduced this year as a result of our commitment to research and development.We have increased our R&D budget by 30% in 2007 as compared to 2006. Tothat end, we have recently opened our new technology center in Pune, India. By year end, weexpect the center to be staffed by approximately 100 employees, most of whichhave advanced degrees and about 25% are PhDs.  The focus of the center is to develop technology forproduction enhancement, cementing, drilling fluids, and completion tools.Additionally, this center will provide technology support for the developmentof the new Asia Pacific supplier base and contain a world-class fluids lab tosupport our Eastern Hemisphere operations. Opening thiscenter is a significant step in our globalization strategy for technology,enabling us to support product development and field operations for Halliburtoncustomers around the world.  Our next global technology expansion will be a center in Singaporeand that location is expected to open by year end. Our plans to globally source new manufacturing needs areprogressing well. In addition to the plant we opened in Mexicoduring the second quarter, we opened two new facilities during the thirdquarter in Braziland Malaysia.These two plants provide us with over 200,000 square feet ofmanufacturing capacity and will produce cementing equipment as well as a broadrange of completion tools for our rapidly expanding business. These twofacilities will allow us to better serve our Latin American and Eastern Hemisphere customers.  Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for some closingcomments. 
David Lesar: Thank you, Andy. If you look back during the third quarter,each of our product lines, except for Completion Tools and Landmark, postedrecord revenue. Completion Tools and Landmark posted their second-highestrevenue quarters and traditionally, the fourth quarter is Landmark's strongest. We also saw a record operating income performance fromSperry, Wireline and Perforating, and Cementing product lines in the thirdquarter. My thanks to all our employees around the world for these significantachievements.  Now let's go to take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from KenSill - Credit Suisse. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Congratulations on what seems to me to be a pretty solidquarter.
David Lesar: Thanks, Ken.
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Watching the stock as you were talking, you started talkingabout pricing pressure in North America expanding toother segments. I'd like to get a little bit more detail on your outlook for North America. A couple of your competitors have talked about the growthin demand for pressure pumping and directional drilling services being asecular, ex-rig count growth as we go after tighter reservoirs and moredirectional drilling. How do you think that impacts your ability to grow ormaintain revenues and profits in North America, assumingthe rig count flattens out here?
Andy Lane: Well clearly, there is some offset to pricing from thevolume activity and we've demonstrated the ability to do that. Away frompressure pumping, some of the product lines we mentioned, drill bits and drillingfluids, but I don't think that's really news there, Ken.
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: But you would expect, even in a flat rig count, to be able toshow some upward revenue in North America in the otherproduct lines, outside of bits and fluids?
Chris Gaut: Yes, Ken, because we continue to see an increase inhorizontal drilling which will fuel our growth in Sperry. Also, it is the highend fracturing market is differentiated from the rig count and we are seeing alot of our pinpoint stimulation fracturing revenues. As we said previously,August was our highest fracturing month in the history of the company so we'reseeing strong demand for our frac services.
David Lesar: Our completions business is also doing well in North America, as we get reemphasis on that.
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: I noticed on the share buyback, it was down significantlyfrom what you had done last quarter. Is that something we should expect? Just alittle bit more modest share repurchases, or is there something that drivesthat one way or the other?
David Lesar: Well, we're not looking to make this on auto pilot; in otherwords, that we're buying a certain number of shares or spending a certainamount of money per quarter. Rather, we're trying to take advantage of theunder-valuation for the benefit of shareholders. So when the stock price islow, we buy more stock. As you see our average purchase price during the thirdquarter was under $34, so we buy more when the stock is low. As the stock beganto move up beginning in late August and continued to move up strongly, our bidwas not hit.  So it will depend upon the opportunity, Ken, but I think youwill also see that our repurchases were among the largest in the space here in thethird quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mike Irvine - Deutsche Bank. 
Mike Irvine - Deutsche Bank: You've given us some sense of your expectations on growth ina couple regions, namely Latin America and Russia.I was wondering, based on what you see today and the visibility you have, ifyou could give us a sense of where the relative growth rates might be or whereyou're going to be growing faster or slower in other parts of the world? Thisis outside of North America, just to be clear.
Andy Lane: We do see a lot of areas of good growth for us. If you lookat our Middle East/Asia Pac segment, it's really Chinaand Saudi Arabiathat we're very optimistic about future growth. In Europeand Africa segment, it's really Egypt,Libya, Russiathat we mentioned in the Caspian. In Latin America, Dave’s comments meant Mexico,Brazil, Columbia, and Argentina also drove strong growth, all in excess of 20%,so that's our highlight areas. 
David Lesar: From a product line standpoint, obviously our fastest-growingdivisions there as we've been saying are Sperry, completions and wireline.
Mike Irvine - Deutsche Bank: Specific to Latin America, I wantedto dig in there a little bit. You did say that the new project awards are goingto be essentially on an integrated project basis in Mexico.Is that right?
David Lesar: Yes, that's right.
Mike Irvine - Deutsche Bank: The track rate of the industry -- certainly not just youguys, but the industry as a whole -- has been having a lot of difficulty with someof those projects in the past. Can you talk a little bit about some of thethings that either you're doing operationally or the way the contracts arestructured to hopefully mitigate some of the risks that the industry has seenin the past on those projects?
David Lesar: Mike, a couple comments. We've had our own experiences thereon those projects and we've learned a lot. The problems we had in the past wereturnkey drilling project bids. We are not bidding turnkey drilling anymore.These are alliance-type projects and we largely influence the customer, that theseare the only projects we would take on in Mexicoin the future. They relate to bundling of our services, providing projectmanagement, drilling engineering. They go with PEMEX-supplied rigs, PEMEX-suppliedtubulars. So it's really a good combination of their rigs and rig personnelwith our discrete services and technologies and then we manage the projects. We'revery pleased with that model of going forward with Mexico.
Mike Irvine - Deutsche Bank: The pricing there and the incentives, are those performanceincentives or time or cost plus? Could you give us a sense on that?
David Lesar: They're fixed prices for our services, for Halliburton-providedservices. But we are not taking on rig time risk. We are not fixing the priceon the rig time.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Crandell - LehmanBrothers. 
Jiim Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Good morning. I want to go back to U.S.pricing. Are prices weak in a number of these other product lines, both becausethey're weakening on their own and because you're packaging them withstimulation or other services?
Andy Lane: Jim, it is largely an aspect of our bundling and the abilityfor us to package the co-offering of Halliburton together in North America. The most competition is in the fracturing segment of thebusiness and we certainly don't want to just compete in the space of thecapacity there. So yes, as we said on the last call, it is bundling and in somecases, we'll do trade -offs on different product lines for the total award. We'vehad some very large awards in the U.S.that we think will serve us well.
Jiim Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Andy, I think on your last call you said there was a lot ofcontractual activity coming in the third quarter. Can you specifically commenton what's already happened? Given how you see rollovers in the fourth quarter,is it a foregone conclusion that U.S.fracturing prices will slip in the first half of the year from current levels?
Andy Lane: Jim, I think the best way to characterize it is still themix and we have a large customer base that is on contract and I thinkpreviously, we have characterized that across the U.S.land as 70% on contract and 30% on short-term pricing or call out. So a largenumber of our contracts have been rebid, but we also have a large number outfor bids right now. As we said from the baseline of the first half of 2007 thatwe see less than 5% impact on pricing alone in the second half of 2007, but wesee that largely offset by increased volumes. At this market pricing,Halliburton is very attractive business to get locked up and so we see a verystrong demand for our fracturing services and that offsets the pricing decline.So we don't see a significant impact in the fourth quarter.
Jiim Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Andy, I agree with all of that. My only question was aboutthe first and second quarters of '08.
David Lesar: Jim, I don't think, for competitive reasons, we’re wantingto signal to our competitors what our pricing strategy is here. So we're beinga little cautious.
Jiim Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Just one follow-up question on well stimulation. If you lookat the Speer Study which has recently been done, it shows that the big threecompanies are 52% of horsepower in U.S.land well stimulation, yet the returns of the business are still quite good.There's been a lot of buzz recently about one of your competitors making asignificant offer for one of the large independents out there.  Is this a strategy that you would consider going forward ifthe market stabilized? To be a buyer of certain of these independents who haveexpanded capacity recently?
David Lesar: Jim, we wouldn't rule out anything, but I would like to saywe see our growth from our internal, organic growth in fracturing. We're themarket leaders. We're going to stay the market leaders. We have seen that wecan do that with our own growth in the business. Also, with the growth in ourbusiness, taking the technology in the U.S. that is relatively immature outsidethe U.S. -- I'm talking about the pinpoint stimulation, the stage fracturing --that's largely how over 80% of the jobs today are run in North America and westill see a lot of growth for our stimulation business outside the United States,as those technologies get transferred. That's another area that we're focusedon growth, but that will be organic growth also.
Operator: Your next question comes from Dan Pickering – PickeringEnergy Partners. 
Dan Pickering – Pickering Energy Partners: Chris, CapEx looks up fairly substantially year over year. Ithink historically you've talked about '08 as a year of lower spending. Is theincremental spending associated with specific contracts, or is this as theycome type spending?
Chris Gaut:  It's associated withbig new contract opportunities that we see internationally, Dan. Now if we wereto win everything, that capital spending wouldn't cover it; so we're assumingwe win a certain portion of that and that would give us the good utilization ofthat new capital in the range of 1.5 to 1.7. It is planned to be associatedwith new contracts that we take on.
Dan Pickering – Pickering Energy Partners: So those are contracts that are out there for bid but havenot yet been awarded, so anticipatory at this point, but it sounds like thenumber or amount of contracts out there has gone up in the last six months?
Chris Gaut: Some of them are ones we have already been awarded. Otherswill be ones that are to be bid.
Andy Lane: We have between $11 billion and $12 billion of contracts outthere that we have visibility on now. What Chris is talking about is the factoringof that $11 billion value to what we feel real confident we're going to win andsome very large projects in the Eastern Hemisphere.
David Lesar: We're also looking at entering a number of new countries in wirelineand perforating. As you know we have taken -- which I think has been a reallygreat strategy over the last number of years in really picking our spots andgrowing our wireline and perforating business. We see a number of markets inthe Eastern Hemisphere that are begging for a wirelineand perforating business to go in and provide some competition. We are going toenter one, if not more, countries next year. We have to build up our equipmentto do that.
Dan Pickering – Pickering Energy Partners: Andy, the $11 billion to $12 billion of projects, thatnumber would have been lower six months ago?
Andy Lane: Yes. We were tracking in the $7 billion range, Dan.
Dan Pickering – Pickering Energy Partners: I want to make sure I understood the discussion around the U.S.market and pumping. Dave, I think you said price pressure less than 5% July 1through December 31. I wanted to understand, is that Halliburton-specific orthe spot market?  Can you help us with what percent of your revenue in thepumping business are this high end, pinpoint, multistage versus the standardgeneric fracturing?
Andy Lane: Dan, the 5% basically is specific to Halliburton since wedon't have insight into anyone else's results. I think given the fact that wehave captured the high end of the fraccing market, I don't think we are quite assusceptible, if you will, to some of the real huge discounting people arehearing about in pressure pumping, and fraccing in particular, in North America. As I said in the discussion, there is a fair amount of workbeing bid out there right now. It is, in many cases, some very good, high endstuff. We don't want to give away our bidding strategy on it, but I think we'llcome out fine on it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup. 
 Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: A couple things on North America. Youseem to tie the restructuring of the business to cost pressures and all of thepricing pressures in North America. Can you tell us alittle bit about where you are in terms of realizing the benefits you expectfrom that?
David Lesar: I think that it is really a combination of things. I thinkwe owed it to ourselves and to our shareholders as we completed the separationof KBR to make sure that we had the appropriate management structure andmanagement team in place to handle a very focused oil field services company. Butwe also weren't immune to what we saw going on over the summer in the NorthAmerican market. Clearly something was going wrong in Canadaat the time, and so I just thought it was prudent for us to take a look at ourstructure, at the management team we had, and make sure that it was the rightone to get focused on the operations that we had. So we made the changes.  We did have some costs in there related to the severance andrestructuring but really, I wouldconsider it more of a continuing, ongoing tweaking of our organization and anaggressive management of our U.S. cost structure. I think that we're trying tomake it scalable for the business we see out there. I don't think we are prepared nor would we want to say whatsort of cost reductions or benefits we might see out of it, because I think atthis point in time, that's a competitive advantage we have and we want to keepthat in-house and use it where we see fit.
 Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: Would you say you're ahead of the current market or in-synchwith the current market in terms of your cost management efforts?
David Lesar: Geoff, I think we try to always stay in synch with where wesee the current market, because I think that we did a pretty good job calling thelast upturn in North America and added capacity andpeople ahead of time. We were able to capture that market when it came around. Ialso think we were maybe a little bit on the front end of some of the scalingback when the last bumps in the road happened over the summer.  We have a really good management team running our NorthAmerican business, and I would say they've got a good feel for things andthey're really in-synch with where the market is today.
 Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup:  With that in mind,and with the comments you've made already about the overall market environment,how confident are you you're going to deliver an increase in North Americanprofit contribution next year over this year?
David Lesar: You're talking about absolute operating income dollars?
 Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup:  Yes.
David Lesar: Then I think we're very confident we're going to producemore next year. But as I indicated, I think with some of the pricing pressureswe see out there, it could have some downward pressure on our operatingmargins. But overall operating margin dollars, we believe, will be up.
 Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: I think Andy mentioned in talking about the Eastern Hemisphere, that the Khurais project was reaching its peak. Iwondered if you could elaborate a little bit on that on a couple dimensions. Doesthat mean it is about to start rolling over and decline? How do you see thetiming of the other opportunities you've spoken about, related to whatever thetrajectory is on Khurais?
David Lesar: Geoff, the good news is that the original drilling targetsthat Saudi Aramco had on the project, we far exceeded that to the scale ofbeing over 30% ahead. We're very efficient. Our Sperry operation is doing anexcellent job, and we talked about our real-time capability that also reallyenhanced the operation of those remote rigs. The project scope from thecustomers’ perspective has not changed. We're just delivering it moreefficiently. So we have another year, a good year of that project, because itwas a megaproject. We see it tailing off in the later part of 2008, justbecause we're completing the project early.
Chris Gaut: It's ramped up to its sustainable full speed for anotheryear, and then it begins to tail off from there.
 Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: How do you see the timing of those other opportunities youtalked about? Do you expect to be able to capture enough in those otheropportunities in a timely fashion that the increase from the other projectsoffsets the rolling over on Khurais? Are there going to be timing issues there?
David Lesar: Geoff, we have bid Manifa, as have our main competitors, andwe have not heard any response back yet on that big project. We still see greatopportunity in Saudi Arabia overall from the other projects they have going andso we still expect more than 20% growth from Saudi Arabia, irregardless of theoutcome on Manifa for next year.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Roger Read - NatexisBleichroeder.
Roger Read - NatexisBleichroeder: As you looked at the international regions, you've runthrough various countries where the audits show pretty good growth 2008 versus2007, and even in 2009. You gave some specifics on Latin America.Could you give us some indication of top line growth you would expect out ofthe Europe/Africa or the Middle East/Asia segments?
David Lesar: Overall, our Eastern Hemispheregrowth, we continue to expect very good growth there. We don't have a specificnumber we're going to give you here on that, Roger. Continue to look for the20% growth level for our international operations.
Roger Read - NatexisBleichroeder: The Gulf of Mexico impact, how you actually would quantifythat and given that we've seen the rig count tail off there, do you actuallyexpect to get a recovery in the fourth quarter? The Dresser issue, is that pretty much, do you think, now aclosed item or is there some potential or residual risk that may have to bedealt with at a later date?
David Lesar:  The Dresser/Baroidmatter was a specific case that is now settled and it has to do with NL andBaroid before they were even a part of Dresser. Of course, a company this sizedoes have ongoing environmental matters in litigation to deal with, but thatmatter is settled.
Andy Lane: Roger, we did lose two weeks of activity, especially in thedeepwater area, and we had 17 deepwater rigs and 13 shelf rigs shutdown during HurricaneDean. It also impacted us for almost one week of offshore work in Mexicowhen the storms hit Mexico,so it had a significant impact on us in the third quarter.
David Lesar:  Both in the Gulf andin Mexico. Probably$25 million or so in total.
Operator: Your next question comes from Scott Gill - Simmons. 
Scott Gill - Simmons: On the Eastern Hemisphere revenuegrowth numbers of around 28%, 29%, when you back out the acquisitions -- forexample, PSL -- what was the organic revenue growth numbers for Eastern Hemisphere?
David Lesar: PSL was very small this quarter. They are just ramping up atthis point. We have some good bids outstanding for them, but it's not major or significantat this point, Scott.
Scott Gill - Simmons: Fair enough. Last year in North America,we saw the Rockies have a pretty substantial impact toyour business, particularly in the first quarter, but we see regional gas priceweakness in the Rockies again this year and of course wehave the environmental restrictions that get applied here in the winter months.Should we be expecting a similar type of seasonal impact to your numbers in thelate part of Q4 or early part of Q1, or not?
Andy Lane: Scott, we do see the same seasonal impacts and the holidayimpacts that we saw last year could impact us again this year like they hadlast year. But we have a very strong Rockies positionwith the express pipeline coming online we see some stabilizing of Rockiesgas prices and local prices in the first quarter, and that may help us. We predictabout the same as last year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley. 
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: You did a lot better than most of us thought in NorthAmerica sequential margins, from 27.1% to 28.2%, even allowing for the reboundin Canada. You mentioned something about bundling pumping services with othersegments of your business and therefore, being able to drive a higher netmargin.  How much of what seemed to be a very good performance wasdue to this item and how much was due to maybe you have a very strong positionin, for example, the Rockies? To what extent were you able to go in and maybeearly on negotiate pricing at better levels in some of those segments?
Andy Lane: Ole, I think you're right on both counts and both had apositive impact. The bundling certainly is part of our strategy, as we takeadvantage of the breadth of Halliburton in our offerings. Being the marketleaders and having a very strong position and having the personnel; I mean,trained personnel is a huge issue right now in the industry and we have a verystrong group in North America, especially in the Rocky Mountains that you mentioned. That does help us negotiate ahead ofcompetitive bidding, where people want to stick with Halliburton and not havethe interruptions in their operation. Both of those helped us.  We also had very strong demand for our services, bothfracturing and cementing. The activity driver and the efficiency model thatDave talked about really drove a lot of our results in the third quarter.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley: So when we look into the second half and you highlighted 5%pricing deterioration is achievable because of your quality, if you looktowards some of the segments of the market that you might be abandoning such asthe more commoditized part of the stimulation market, what are you seeing otherpeople’s pricing doing in those segments of the market on successful bids?
David Lesar: We are seeing some aggressive discounting in the market.Again, I don't think it's helpful for us to engage in speculating about what wewould do or what others are doing specifically. Ole, suffice it to say that weare seeing some aggressive discounting in the commodity end of the market fromthose who don't have the utilization that we do.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael LaMotte - JP Morgan.
Michael LaMotte - JP Morgan: Chris, a couple of quick clarifications if I could. First,the positive change in working capital this quarter, what was behind that? Apretty big positive jump.
Chris Gaut: We did have an increase in receivables. That's in partlinked to the shift to more international business where receivables do tend tobe a bit longer. I think we'll see that stabilize. With the increased attentionit's getting, I don't think that rate of growth will continue.  Also as we are bringing on these new manufacturingfacilities that were mentioned in Southeast Asia and Mexico and so forth, weare bringing more inventory, raw material and work in process up, so that'sgoing to be part of it. That goes with the territory, there.
Michael LaMotte - JP Morgan: Was there any revenue pick-up from the acquisition in thequarter?
Chris Gaut: Minor this quarter, less than $30 million. That will begreater in future periods as we integrate that with our operations and as welearn about the bids that we're now making for that equipment.
Michael LaMotte - JP Morgan: On Saudi, the growth comment that you're talking about '08,is that simply just operating at a higher plateau level on Al-Khurais so thatyou get year-on-year pickup? Do you actually see that 20% number being up fromcurrent levels at Al-Khurais? I'm trying to get a gross versus net sense as towhat your activities in that market look like.
Andy Lane:  What we're saying iswe ramped up through 2007. We're now at the peak level at Khurais and we see asustained year of maintaining this level of drilling activity. That drives alot of the growth. Also, we still see good opportunities. We have new screenofferings that we are introduced into Saudi Arabia. We have growth in our Smart Wellbusiness through Well Dynamics, we see growth there. So a lot of our high-endoffering we still see penetration because Saudi Aramco continues to be a goodtechnology buyer and so there will be growth in both the sand screens and SmartWells, along with our drilling on Khurais.
Michael LaMotte - JP Morgan:  So we should reallythink about it not so much in terms of counting rigs, but product penetrationand the cyclical evolution of that market?
Andy Lane:  Exactly.
Michael LaMotte - JP Morgan: On the efficiency question, I'm trying to get back to thispoint of how much of it is process and ongoing and something that we can expectto be there in potentially volatile quarters in the future? How much of it isyou guys moved aggressively on Canadain particular and parts of the lower 48 in the March/April timeframe of this year and so you sawsome real benefit from that in the third quarter? Can you give us a sense as to lumpiness versus smooth impacton the efficiency side?
Andy Lane: Mike, Ithink it's largely we did exactly what we said we were going to do. We movedequipment out of Canada and people early. We took advantage of them through thethird quarter. Some of that equipment and personnel, because of the softness inCanada, is going to stay in the U.S. We took some to Latin America also and we did see very goodopportunities to capitalize on that.  If the Canadian market strengthens in the end of the fourthquarter and first quarter, we'll opportunistically move some resources backthere. But we see that as a very fluid movement across the border. We had someadditional fracturing and cementing equipment come out in the second half ofthe year. We're taking full advantage of that extra capacity we have.
David Lesar:  Some of therestructuring that we've done in the third quarter, those costs were incurredin the third quarter. We'll have the benefits going forward. There are moreefficiencies to be gained.
Operator: Your final question comes from Kurt Hallead - RBC CapitalMarkets. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: You talk a lot about the gains that you're making in a numberof different markets internationally. I think a lot of people may look at thatand question whether or not that is coming at some element of a discountingfrom a pricing standpoint. Obviously, that's not always the answer. I wonder ifyou could provide some color as to these gains that are coming. Is it coming onpricing? Is it coming on reliability, technology? Anything along those lineswould be helpful.
David Lesar: If you look at the fact that our margins are consistentlygoing up in the Eastern Hemisphere, I think that wouldindicate that we are not chasing that work by essentially buying it. I thinkthat we have indicated in the calls over the last year or so that we haveheavily invested in our Eastern Hemisphere infrastructure, both in terms ofhiring and training new, young engineers; expanding our facilities; and,investing in capital equipment. We continue to do that and our margins continueto expand and our revenues continue to grow.  So to me, I think it's a very good combination and it seemsto be working. It's certainly something that we are going to continue to do. Iwould say, no. I don't think we are pursuing a growth strategy via discounting.I think we're doing it the old-fashioned way and it's paying off for us.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: A lot of focus, obviously, on North American pricing trends.Can you give us some color, some sense on the international front? Are therestill elements of pricing power or would you consider it more flat?
Chris Gaut: It's very hard, Kurt, to generalize about the internationalmarket. Each market, each bid is its own microcosm. I think in general, there is modest priceimprovement, but price is not going to be the biggest driver of internationalgrowth; it is going to be volume. Just as we were saying, if we can get the additionalequipment out there as we now are able to with our greater manufacturingcapacity, we'll be less constrained in our resources. There is demand, thereare contracts we're taking on and we see that good growth and margins building.
David Lesar: Thank you all for joining us. We appreciate your attentionand we'll talk to you next quarter.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Halliburton's second quarter 2007 earnings call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Evelyn Angelle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Angelle, please begin. 
Evelyn Angelle: Thanks, Christopher. Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2007 earnings conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on our website for seven days. A podcast download will also be available.  The press release announcing the second quarter results is available on the Halliburton website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, our CEO; Chris Gaut, our CFO; and Andy Lane, our COO. In today’s call, Dave will provide opening remarks, Chris will discuss our overall operating performance and financial position, followed by Andy, who will highlight some of our recent contract wins and technology successes. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks.  Before turning the call over to Dave, I would like to remind our audience that some of today’s comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006; our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2007; and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Also, please refer to this morning’s earnings release and our website for any non-GAAP disclosures.  Now I’ll turn the call over to Dave Lesar. Dave. 
David J. Lesar: Thanks, Evelyn and good day, everyone. I’ll begin my remarks by discussing and focusing on the North America markets, which in Q2 represented 47% of our total revenue for the quarter, then provide a few highlights from our international operations and then include our view for the remainder of the year.  First, let me address the U.S. frac market, which accounted for approximately 17% of our consolidated revenue for the first-half of this year. I’m very happy to report that we have been experiencing a good recovery from the frac market slowdown this past winter. We have been tracking frac activity levels by month and saw steady increases each month between March and June. In fact, in June we experienced the highest frac revenue in our history, which I think may come as a surprise to some folks who think the frac market is headed for a significant decline.  We are expecting activity levels and equipment utilization rates to continue to increase throughout the rest of this year as our customers work toward achieving their 2007 production goals.  We’ve seen a slight deterioration in pricing, less than 5%, in the first-half of this year, and this could continue during the second-half of the year. However, we continue to differentiate ourselves through our leading market position in technology, service quality, and reservoir knowledge. Our expectation is that activities will remain high for the balance of the year.  Unlike our frac business, the other part of pressure pumping, our cementing business, has not experienced the volatility in activity nor the pricing pressures we have experienced in the frac business. Demand for our U.S. cementing services has remained strong. We’ve also been focusing on diversifying our U.S. operations by capitalizing on the trend toward increased horizontal or directional drilling in the land market. Our Sperry, drill bits, and completion tool business each benefit from this shift from traditional vertical drilling programs.  Overall in the U.S., we’ve increased operating margins by more than 100 basis points on a sequential basis and in fact, we posted the highest U.S. revenue in our history, which goes to demonstrate the strength of our franchise.  We’ve also been awarded recently some major multiple product line contracts in the U.S., which will continue our diversification program for this market, and Any will talk about these in a moment.  Canada has experienced a significant decline in activity and pricing as compared to last year and of course, March through June was impacted by the spring break-up season. Beginning in late 2006, we began moving equipment and personnel from Canada to the U.S. and Latin America to address the anticipated slowdown. We also put into effect a reduction in workforce.  These steps were prudent considering what took place in Canada this quarter. Our drilling information evaluation segment was hit particularly hard by the slowdown in Canada and accounted for approximately $20 million of that segment’s decline in operating income on a sequential basis.  Looking ahead, we’re not planning on a significant recovery in Canada this year, outside of a seasonal recovery from the break-up. To give you some perspective, Canada revenue represents less than 5% of our consolidated revenue in 2006 and should be even less this year.  Now let me provide some highlights and results on our outlook on the company outside of North America. First, our sequential Eastern Hemisphere revenue growth was in excess of 14%, an excellent result, and our Eastern Hemisphere operating margins improved by over 100 basis points to 22%. Our commitment to allocating capital to product lines with high growth potential in the Eastern Hemisphere is clearly showing up in our record revenue.  Our sequential incremental margins for Latin America, Middle East, Asia regions were in excess of 40%. However, since we’ve been planning for more growth, we are continuing to increase our international workforce and are incurring training costs for these personnel now in anticipation of future revenue generation. The same is true for our investment in infrastructure to support our international growth.  While these costs impact the bottom line now, we believe they will pay off in the future.  We remain very bullish on our ability to grow Eastern Hemisphere operations for the balance of this year and throughout the rest of the decade. We’ve also completed all conditions for closing on the PSL acquisition. The effective date for this closing will be July 31st. This transaction is roughly 50% larger than the Ultraline acquisition we closed earlier this year and will provide an improved diversification into international markets for our production enhancement businesses. PSL is a recognized leader in well intervention and pipeline and production services. Their market concentration is in Europe, the Middle East, Azerbaijan, Algeria and Asia-Pac.  We’ve also signed a definitive agreement to acquire Burservice, a Russian national directional drilling company with a strong market position in northern Siberia. This acquisition gives us a new area for expansion and is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing horizontal drilling market in Russia. We plan to expand their current service offerings to include our rotary steerable and LWD technologies  Our completion tools operation posted exceptionally strong results in the second quarter. Chris will give you some details around this in a few minutes but I wanted to mention two new large contracts that were recently awarded. First, a five-year $200 million contract in Malaysia was awarded. Also, completion tools was awarded a $170 million five-year contract in off-shore China for sand control completions for over 200 wells.  And our landmark operations posted a strong second quarter. This bodes very well for landmark’s contribution during the second-half of the year, as we usually see landmark results ramp up in the latter part of the year.  Let me turn the call over to Chris now and he’ll give you some more details on the quarter. 
C. Christopher Gaut: Thanks, Dave. I will discuss our second quarter results compared sequentially to the first quarter. Halliburton's revenue in the second quarter was $3.7 billion, up $313 million or 9% from last quarter. More than three-fourths of the increase came from outside of North America, where we saw higher activity in all international regions and a recovery from the seasonally slower Russia, Caspian, and North Sea markets and as Dave said, we continue to see an increase in activity in the U.S. from the slow period we experienced last winter. Canadian revenue was down to about half of the first quarter amount.  Operating income increased $105 million, or 13%, over the first quarter. Production enhancement and completion tools contributed significantly to this increase.  Our strong sequential growth came despite Canada, where we actually had a loss in the second quarter. Second quarter results included a $49 million gain on the sale of our remaining interest in Dresser Inc. This gain is reflected in operating income in our digital consulting solutions segment.  Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.62, consisting of $0.63 from continuing operations and $0.99 from discontinued operations. We recognized a $933 million net gain on the disposition of KBR as discontinued operations during the second quarter. The gain represents the difference between the book value of our remaining 81% interest in KBR and the fair value of the 85 million Halliburton shares that were exchanged, net of the estimated fair market value of the indemnities provided to KBR and net of related taxes.  Our second quarter share count was impacted by the 85 million shares we brought into treasury on April 5th as a result of the KBR split-off, as well as resumption of our share repurchase program in May. Under that program during the second quarter, we repurchased 25.7 million shares at an average price of $35.37 per share.  As we announced earlier this month, our Board of Directors recently increased the authorization on our share repurchase program by an additional $2 billion. Having repurchased $2.2 billion of our stock over the past 16 months, we now have approximately $2.8 billion remaining under our authorization. We will continue to take advantage of low valuation to buy back shares aggressively, as we did during the last few months.  As of June 30, we had actual shares outstanding of approximately 890 million. The dilutive effect of the premium on our convertible notes and employee equity compensation usually adds approximately 40 million to our diluted EPS calculation.  Now I’ll highlight the segment results. Production optimization revenue increased $196 million, or 15% from last quarter, and operating income grew $78 million, or 24% over the first quarter. Production enhancement revenue increased 12% and operating income grew 18%. These results reflect a strong recovery of the U.S. land frac market, increased second quarter activity in the North Sea and Caspian areas as compared to a seasonally slower first quarter, and improved stimulation vessel utilization. Of course, Canadian production enhancement revenue and operating income were adversely impacted by the slowdown in the seasonal spring break-up.  The performance of our completion tools business was the highlight this quarter. Completion tools revenue increased 22% over the first quarter and operating income grew by 40%. Much of the 310 basis point operating margin improvement was due to solid performance in our reservoir information and sand control product lines and was bolstered by increased sales of some of our leading technology products, such as Easy Well swell packers.  Completion tools’ Eastern Hemisphere revenue grew by 31% and operating income in the Eastern Hemisphere completion tools grew by 53%. The improvement was widespread geographically.  In the Middle East, we had increased intelligent well and other completion product sales into Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Africa revenue was up sharply due to higher activity in Western Africa and Egypt, as well as more high-end completion product sales. Completion tools also posted strong revenue and operating income growth in Latin America and in Asia-Pacific. Results from our well dynamics joint venture improved over the prior quarter as they continue to work through their supply chain issues.  Looking ahead, completion tools revenue and operating income margin will likely come down a bit in the third quarter as their revenues tend to vary quarter to quarter due to the timing of deliveries.  We have recently won a number of completion projects, as Dave mentioned. We are ramping up our manufacturing capacity and completion tools so the future prospects here are quite good.  Fluid systems revenue increased $52 million or 5%, while operating income declined by $14 million or 7%. Cementing revenue grew 5% while operating income remained flat. Canadian cementing revenue decreased by nearly three-fourths of the first quarter level, reflecting the break-up season. As you’ll recall, we moved personnel and equipment out of this market in anticipation of the slowdown and spring break-up. This decline though was more than offset by increases in the U.S., Mexico, Russia, Caspian, and North Sea activity.  Baroid revenue also grew by 5% reflecting higher activity, primarily in offshore operations in the North Sea and in the Gulf of Mexico. The large contract win that we had last year in Norway is progressing well and the customer is beginning to award us new work outside of that contract as a result of our service quality. Baroid’s second quarter operating income was unfavorably impacted by the Canadian downturn and a $7 million charge for an additional reserve for an old environmental matter in the U.S. Further, we experienced some start-up costs as we open more Baroid bulk plants around the world.  Turning to our drilling and formation evaluation segment, revenue increased $36 million or 4% over the prior quarter, while operating income decreased $21 million or 8%. Sperry’s results were significantly impacted by Canada’s spring break-up season. In the Eastern Hemisphere, results were very strong with Sperry posting a 15% increase in revenue and a 25% increase in operating income as compared to the first quarter, led by offshore work in West Africa and the North Sea, and the continuing ramp up in Asia.  For our wireline and perforating operations, low Canadian results accounted for most of the decline in operating income compared to the first quarter. Outside of North America, wireline and perforating posted an 8% increase in revenue and a 13% increase in operating income. As you know, we’ve been steadily adding wireline and perforating capital equipment over the last year or so and this investment is now showing results.  Our drill bits business posted a 5% increase in revenue yet operating income decline 13% from the prior quarter, primarily due to Canada. Our operations in the North Sea and in Africa were positively impacted by improved sales of drill bits and increased activity from our down-hole tools, particularly our new XR reamer hole enlargement tool.  In the digital consulting solution segment, landmark revenue grew 28% and operating income 89% over the seasonally slow first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the $49 million gain on the sale of our interest in Dresser Inc. is included in this segment. Landmark experienced revenue and operating income growth in all four regions on improved sales of software and consulting solutions.  Now I will address some additional financial items. As we announced in May, our Board of Directors increased our dividend by 20%, which reflects the Board’s and management’s positive long-term view on Halliburton's growth prospects. Our annualized after-tax return on equity for the second quarter was 32.8%, based on continuing operations and excluding the gain on sale of the Dresser investment.  We expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $135 million to $140 million per quarter during the remainder of 2007.  The effective tax rate for continuing operations in the second quarter was 32%, reflecting the higher mix of foreign income. We expect the effective tax rate for the remaining quarters of this year to be in the 32% to 33% range.  And we expect general corporate costs to be approximately $60 million quarterly for the remainder of the year.  Now let me turn it over to Andy Lane, our Chief Operating Officer. Andy. 
Andrew Lane: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. What I’d like to do now is update you on some of our more significant projects around the world, including some exciting new project wins and also let you know about some recent technology successes.  Our Khurais project in Saudi Arabia continues to go well. In particular, utilizing geo-pilot rotary steerable technology, Sperry has exceeded the client’s planned drilling performance expectations. New security drill bit designs are also contributing to improved drilling performance. The real-time operations center established earlier this year in Saudi is providing a significant contribution to our overall performance. We now believe the project will reach its peak during the first quarter of 2008.  Another important country for us is Mexico, where the National Oil Company has an aggressive plan for future development. We had a long and positive relationship with PMEX and we continue to grow our business there. PMEX is now one of our top five customers worldwide and Mexico is now larger for us than Canada.  We’ve also targeted growth in Latin America outside of Mexico. One recent example is the $140 million contract award to our completion tools product line to provide exploration and development testing services in high pressure, high temperature environments. Our differentiated technologies in large board drill stem test tools and memory data acquisition services were important factors in this award.  In the U.S., we’ve had some significant wins in the past few months. Halliburton has signed a long-term agreement with a major operator to provide primary well services for a Rockies asset. Specifically, the services includes Sperry drilling services, Baroid drilling and completion fluids, security bits, cementing, logging and stimulation. If the agreement endures for the full length of its primary term, we value it at approximately $450 million.  The arrangement creates and immediate and long-term opportunity for efficiency gains and the application of technology and processes to exploit significant gas reserves.  Another multi-service contract was entered into the Rockies for another major operator. Halliburton will provide all services in this multi-year award valued at $170 million. One of the shell trends expansion areas is in the Northeastern U.S., where Halliburton was awarded an $80 million multi-year contract that includes fracturing, cementing, coal tubing, directional drilling, drilling fluids and tools.  Currently our pinpoint stimulation technologies are being used for evaluation of the horizontal wells and future wells will also include the aqua-stem service on the fracturing treatments. The aqua-stem service has proven successful in other shell projects and conventional pipe gas in the U.S.  The application of our delta stim completion system is also expanding into the Northeast. In Kentucky recently we did nine stages were stimulated in one well bore, allowing for interventionless operation.  During the second quarter, we introduced new technology at Sperry, the pilot family of rotary steerable tools. We introduced our geo-pilot rotary steering service to the market in 2002. We are now offering four additional tools in the pilot family. First, a new version of the geo-pilot called the geo-pilot XL that is designed for higher levels of reliability in more challenging drilling environments. We expect to achieve a substantial increase in reliability with this service.  Second, the geo-pilot GXT tool, which combines a high-performance motor with geo-pilot for even higher rates of penetration and vibration control in harsh drilling environments.  Third, the EZ-Pilot rotary steering service designed for lower cost, typically land-based operations. You may recall EZ-Pilot was a technology acquisition we did in late 2005. We finalized the development of this tool and it is now commercial.  Finally, the V pilot, a high precision vertical drilling tool.  Our pilot fleet offering gives us a strong technology base to accelerate our growth in Sperry drilling services. Although we only have a limited number of tools for the EZ-Pilot, the GXT, and the V pilot, based on the demand we are seeing we have an aggressive drill schedule for new tools. You should see these tools adding meaningfully to Sperry’s results in 2008.  In the second quarter, over 60% of Sperry’s revenue was generated in the Eastern Hemisphere and these new technology introductions will further strengthen and grow our Eastern Hemisphere business.  We are very excited about the six project wins totaling $1.2 billion in future revenue, with $700 million coming from the Rockies and the Northeast and $510 million coming from outside the U.S.  Finally, we are optimistic about the additions of PSLES and Burservice to our portfolio. These businesses expand our capabilities and our 100% Eastern Hemisphere growth for us.  Now I’ll turn the call back to Dave for some closing comments. Dave. 
David J. Lesar: Thanks, Chris and Andy. Our quarterly results reflect our continued commitment to grow outside of North America. Sperry and completion tools led that growth for us but each of our product lines, except for production enhancement and landmark, posted the highest revenue in their history.  I want to thank all of our employees around the world for this significant achievement. As I said earlier, we look forward to continuing to grow our business in both the Eastern and Western Hemisphere and are very excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us.  Now we’ll go ahead and take questions. Christopher, could you go open the phone lines for Q&A please. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question or comment comes from the line of Jim Crandell. Your line is open, sir. Mr. Crandell. It looks like he is no longer in queue. Mr. Crandell, if you could please press the one key once again. We’ll take our next question. It comes from the line of Geoff Kieburtz with Citigroup. Your line is open. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me okay? 
David J. Lesar: Yes, we’ve got you, Geoff. Good morning. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: I want to come back to your comments on the pricing, Dave. You said that you had seen about a 5% -- well, I guess, could you just repeat them? Five percent pricing decline and the expectation you might see that extend into the second-half -- does that mean further declines? 
David J. Lesar: There clearly is price competition in the frac market in the U.S. What we’ve seen so far this year, 2007, as we said, is just under 5% price decline in our average pricing so far this year. We do expect that there will be continued price pressure in the second-half. Andy. 
Andrew Lane: Overall when you look globally, we’ve had stable prices but as we referred with Chris and Dave’s comments, the under 5% is limited to the frac business. We have roughly 65% of our contracts now renegotiated with the new pricing that we’ve talked about in the first-half of the year. So we see that same competitive market going on in the second-half. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay, so same competitive market meaning pricing stabilizes or pricing continues to contract something like 5% every six months? 
Andrew Lane: That’s the rate we saw in the first six months, Geoff and we’re saying is that we expect that there will be continued price decline in the second-half. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay, all right. In spite of the fact that you are seeing record levels of demand? 
David J. Lesar: We are. It’s hard to say where that’s going to balance out but that’s where we are at this point in time, Geoff. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: In terms of the contracts, Andy, you mentioned that 65% of your contracts have been renegotiated. To what extent -- does that mean that there is a fixed price for that work going forward for what, the next year? 
Andrew Lane: Well, Geoff, as you know, we have a lot of different contracts. Some one-year contracts, some multiple-year contracts like the ones we talked about in the script today. And then there is a transactional market that is small, relatively small for us.  So yes, there’s contracts that are in place for the year and we expect most of those contracts to hold. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay, so the price -- that work would not be exposed to any further changes in the spot market? 
Andrew Lane: That’s correct. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay. And just a quick one -- I think, Chris, you mentioned something about a $7 million charge at Baroid. 
C. Christopher Gaut: That’s correct. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: And that is -- 
C. Christopher Gaut: An additional reserve for an environmental matter dating back to Baroid, an ancient history there, yes. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay, and that is in the operating income line for fluids for this quarter. Okay, great. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Ken Sill with Credit Suisse. Mr. Sill, your line is open. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Thank you and congratulations. Good quarter. Things happen a little bit different than I expected in terms of margins and I guess the one thing that looks a little disturbing is the trend in North America where the margins have eroded fairly steadily since Q2 of last year. I’m wondering -- obviously the volumes in North America seem okay and Canada is past the worst part. Do you think the margin erosion is going to continue or will the volumes be able to kind of slow or stop the margin erosion in the North American business? 
David J. Lesar: Well, Ken, this quarter clearly the biggest impact on our North American margins was Canada and Q2 is always the low point in Canada. As we mentioned, we actually had a loss this quarter in Canada, and so the decremental margins were quite severe. So we won’t have that downward sequential change going forward.  And then as we mentioned, we do have some pricing pressure in the frac market in North America, although the volumes and the activity there are quite good. 
Andrew Lane: I would just add there is the pressure in frac but the rest of our pricing in the U.S. has stabilized, especially in cementing and our drilling business and completion business. As Chris said, we’ve seen a steady improvement in the overall demand level, April, May and then June was, as Dave said, the record in our history for both frac revenue and our total U.S. revenue.  And so we are seeing a good strengthening demand. We see a good quarter ahead of us for activity and so those two offset each other somewhat. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: And then just a follow-up; looking at the specific product lines, drilling and formation evaluation, again I’m assuming that Canada was the big hit there, although on a year-over-year basis the margins were up slightly. So should we expect a nice rebound in margins there or is it Canada plus new costs related to rollouts internationally and it might actually be a little bit slower to rebound, the timing there? 
Andrew Lane: The Canada -- we should see a good rebound in third quarter. We are very strong in Canada in Sperry and security DBS, our business up there and they were both heavily impacted. And we also too on the start-up of the Ultraline costs, and so all three of those impacted that segment significantly and we should see a good return in third quarter. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Thank you. I’ll let somebody else ask some questions. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jim Crandell. Your line is open, sir. 
James D. Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Can you hear me now? 
David J. Lesar: Yes, Jim, we can. 
James D. Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Okay. I’m sorry. Andy, I’m sorry but I still didn’t understand part of your answer to Geoff. You said contracts in place for the year in U.S. stimulation you expect prices to hold. Does that mean hold from the levels they are at the first-half or does it mean the one-year contract renewals that you negotiate late this year for 2008 you expect to hold versus ’07 levels? 
Andrew Lane: Jim, let me clarify; the 65% of the contracts we renegotiated in the first-half of 2007 were on the new pricing and we expect those to hold into 2008. The rest of the transactional market and the contracts we are yet to negotiate, we will negotiate the contracts here in the next 60 days, 90 days. We’ll see a lot of that contract activity happen in the third quarter and then the transactional market is uncertain where the pricing will go there. 
James D. Crandell - Lehman Brothers: And how do you expect the contracts that you’ll negotiated for ’08 to be in the, that you negotiate in the third and fourth quarters, how would you expect those to be ’08 pricing versus ’07 pricing? 
Andrew Lane: Well as Chris said, there’s going to be some pricing in some isolated areas but overall, we feel good about the level of pricing we had in the first-half of 2007 and the big thing for us, Jim, is demand continues to increase as we brought capacity to the market and we are expanding our frac business to the record levels we’ve had, so activity and effective utilization will play an important part of our overall profitability in the second-half. 
James D. Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Okay, a tougher question for Dave; Dave, how much of your time have you been spending now in the Middle East, and specifically in Dubai? Is it possible to start to see the effects of you personally spending more time there? 
David J. Lesar: I think, Jim, I’ve been spending -- I can tell you that I’ve spent six of the last seven weeks outside of the U.S. In fact, I just got back in last night but just as when I was based in Houston, I really didn’t spend a lot of time in my office in Houston. So I’m traveling extensively through the Eastern Hemisphere at this point in time. I remain very excited about the opportunities for continued growth that I see over there but I would not attribute any particular success in our business to the fact that I’m based out of Dubai versus Houston.  We have a great diversified workforce through the Eastern Hemisphere, great technology over there. But I think the reaction from our customer base, especially the senior executives of our Eastern Hemisphere-based customers and national oil companies about my living and working out of Dubai has been very, very positive. 
James D. Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Okay. Good to hear and good quarter. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Roger Read. Your line is open, sir. 
Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder: Good morning, gentlemen. A quick question for you; didn’t really hear much talk about it, kind of a quiet quarter on the acquisition front. Can you update us on what you are looking for, whether or not with some weakening in North America if some acquisitions potentially look better here, prices having become more reasonable from the asking side, and if there’s anything in particular internationally that makes more sense than something else? 
David J. Lesar: Well, we did talk about two acquisitions, Roger. We talked about the PSL acquisition that will close at the end of this month and then we talked about the new one that we just announced, the Burservice Russian directional drilling company, and we have that agreement now and closing is expected in the near future.  So those are both examples of businesses that we can -- we acquired a base of operations in the Eastern Hemisphere and can add our technology and our product line through them and grow them.  Back in the Western Hemisphere, we also announced this quarter the acquisition of Vector Magnetics, which is a key technology for steam assisted gravity drilling in Canada, SAG B, the heavy oil production technique and with us taking ownership of that technology, it will give us a very strong market position in that space going forward, and that acquisition is now closed.  So those are examples of the kinds of things we are looking for, our focus going forward, Roger, continues to be on products or technologies we can put through our distribution system, or finding local operations that we can build by adding our technology.  The fact that the private equity market maybe is cooling a bit, maybe a little bit more difficult to get financing, will hopefully work to our advantage. 
Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder: And then a follow-up question; as you look internationally, a lot of these new contracts, whether Mexico or in the Middle East, you’ve talked a lot of times about, or recently in several quarters about start-up costs being a significant factor. You mentioned that in terms of the second quarter for DF&E up in Canada with the recent acquisition. Do you expect to see any moderation in start-up costs or are there enough contracts out there in new -- I don’t know, new parts of a country or new countries, where that likely is just the run-rate at this point and we shouldn’t look for any particular margin changes as a result of a change in start-up cost pace? 
Andrew Lane: Let me address that. It varies widely depending on what business you are talking about. On the completion tools where it’s product sales, we really don’t have a lot of start-up costs. So if you look at each of them, Malaysia was an ongoing business for us, expand in China. We have a good presence in the South China Sea, so that was an expansion of business for us. So those types of contracts, there’s not a lot of start-up costs.  If you talk about the Baroid with that oil where that was a 100% win for us previous quarter, there were a lot of start-up costs of new people, and Chris mentioned it in his comments, the mud plants expansion.  So depending on which service line it is, there is some related start-up costs and in some cases, very minimal. But I think -- 
Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder: Is there any -- in terms of what you have seen in say the last two or three quarters and what you would expect through the back-half of ’07, is there reason to expect any change in that pace of start-up costs or is the business you are running today is pretty much what it ought to be in the foreseeable future? 
David J. Lesar: I think what we have is obviously our Eastern Hemisphere business continued to grow. We need to continue to invest in it. We see good opportunities and we believe that we will see margin expansion even as that growth continues but it would not go at -- that margin expansion would not be at the rate that it could be if we hadn’t and weren’t making the infrastructure upgrades, but we believe that those are very long-term investments and will be very long-term payoffs for us. So we believe we’ll have growth, continued costs but also some margin expansion. 
Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Scott Gill with Simmons & Company. Your line is open. 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: Thank you. Good morning. Chris, just real quick, I know you disclose this in your 10-Q but do you have the revenue and operating income for production optimization here for North America? 
C. Christopher Gaut: The margin for production optimization in North America? 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: Yes, the revenue and operating income? 
C. Christopher Gaut: Let’s see -- revenue for production optimization in North America, $877 million; and operating income, $101 million. 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: Okay, and I guess Andy, from an operational standpoint -- 
C. Christopher Gaut: Wait, I’m sorry. Hold on for a second. Sorry. I gave you the month. $266 million. That sounds a lot better -- $266 million of operating income. 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: 266? 
C. Christopher Gaut: 266. 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: And 877? 
C. Christopher Gaut: Yes, 30% operating margin, 44% incremental margin. 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: Okay. Thank you. Andy, on the Sperry business, can you talk a little bit about the top line growth in the U.S. market? Also, if you could give us some color on the non-North America top line growth at Sperry, what you are seeing there and what the big drivers are going forward? 
Andrew Lane: If you think about Sperry’s business, a little more than 60% is Eastern Hemisphere and around 40% is the west. In the U.S. market, Scott, it really -- Sperry has taken advantage of the directional drilling expansions and the horizontal well activity and so that is a big driver for the growth here. We also have strong positions in Latin America, very strong in Brazil. And so those are the drivers. We were hurt, as everyone on the drilling side was hurt in Canada this quarter, but that will rebound nicely for the second-half for Sperry.  So those are the drivers on the west. The east is really project-related. Lots of activity in the far east for Sperry. They are doing very well. Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, and then the Saudi project is doing extremely well for Sperry. And then we have our traditional markets both in the U.K. and Norway, doing very good, primarily in the U.K., and then we are expanding into West Africa with Sperry. So that’s the drivers for the east. 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: And the U.S. top line revenue growth for Sperry was about what this quarter? 
C. Christopher Gaut: For Sperry, the revenue growth? 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: Right. 
C. Christopher Gaut: 17% -- I’m sorry, about, no, about 10%. 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: 10% on a sequential basis, Chris? 
C. Christopher Gaut: I’m sorry, Sperry for Western Hemisphere? 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: I was actually looking for U.S. but -- 
C. Christopher Gaut: Yes, well, for U.S. -- it was 10% for North America, but Canada was way down so U.S. was substantially higher than that. 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: So it’s continued to go at a very rapid pace? 
C. Christopher Gaut: Yes. 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: All right. Thank you so much, gentlemen, and good quarter. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brad Handler with Wachovia Capital Markets. Your line is open. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of I guess additional color or just tying in the segments versus geographies, please. So if there was 50 basis points of improvement in margin in Africa, Europe, Africa, CIS, it sounds like that was maybe constrained by the bulk plant going in in Norway. Were there some other factors that were one-time-ish in nature there? Just relatively low incrementals relative to what I might have expected. 
Andrew Lane: Yes, we had a stim vessel that was not -- I guess was in the shipyard there in the Middle East. Another one with low utilization, and so stim vessels were low in Africa, rather, during the quarter. It was just a mix of things that with the incrementals, and Europe and Africa weren’t as high as in some other areas. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: Okay, and then if I ask the question in reverse, the Middle East and Asia, it sounds like if I were to guess the completion tool sales might have improved the margins in that region and that’s why you are maybe suggesting that -- so by implication you are suggesting maybe that trims back a bit in the third quarter? Is that right or are there some other factors that drove that margin a little higher than they are sustainably? 
C. Christopher Gaut: Drilling formation evaluation was a key factor for Middle East and Asia and that will -- we see that continuing. Completions are a bit lumpy and a lot of that was in the Middle East and Asia but as we are pointing to the trend there is one of increase in activity, increased volumes and very good margin overall but some lumpiness from quarter to quarter. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: Thanks and if I can steal another one, just a different direction, interesting to hear comments about the multi-service contracts in the U.S. Do you see a trend forming where there is more of that? Are you all driving that or are your competitors driving that relative to what we’ve seen recently? Just some additional color would be interesting. Thanks. 
Andrew Lane: We’ve been driving that from a Halliburton perspective. The one Halliburton approach, trying to get the breadth of everything we have in the portfolio. It certainly differentiates us from many of the small competitors in the discrete business. So yes, that has been the approach and then sometimes we put together with the project management some drilling engineering services and consulting services with landmark on top of that bundle. But we have been promoting bundled packages of Halliburton and we will continue to do that. It’s very effective for us. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: Very good. Okay, thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Jeff Tillery with Pickering Partners. Your line is open, sir. 
C. Christopher Gaut: And we’ll take one more question after this, Christopher. 
Jeff Tillery - Pickering Energy Partners: Good morning, guys. Just one quick question on international revenue base. Outside the positive lumps in the production optimization from completion tools, is there any reason to expect Q2 doesn’t form a good baseline to use going forward? 
David J. Lesar: No, with that caveat, no, we think that second quarter represents the progress that we’re making in building up our Eastern Hemisphere base, Jeff, yes. 
Jeff Tillery - Pickering Energy Partners: Okay, and then just one question on the U.S.; Andy, you talked about increasing revenues. As the month played out through the second quarter, did you see U.S. margins show that same upward trajectory or how did margins perform as the quarter progressed? 
Andrew Lane: Yes, Jeff, the margins did improve going month-to-month in the second quarter. Utilization and optimizing the use of our assets is a huge driver for our profitability and so with the high activity level we saw in June and we’re seeing here in July, that’s a big driver for our profitability, yes. 
Jeff Tillery - Pickering Energy Partners: Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you. Our final question or comment comes from the line of Geoff Kieburtz with Citigroup. Your line is open. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Thanks. Just a follow-up; with all the moving parts that we’ve already talked about in regard to North America, would it be fair to conclude that the margins in North America for the second quarter represent the low-end of what you expect for the future? 
Andrew Lane: Well, Geoff, there are a lot of moving parts. We’re having a number of our divisions growing in North America, like our DFE groups. But on the whole, those tend to be lower margins than our stimulation business has been, so there’s a mix effect there.  With the stim business itself, as we said we’re expecting that there could be further price deterioration but the volume and the utilization of our equipment is improving. So we are sorting all that out. Particularly with the mix effect, I think that could cause our average margins in the U.S. to decline, but from a dollar standpoint continue to grow. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: But you do have the -- If I understood you correctly, Canada was a -- despite the fact that you took preemptive cost reduction actions, Canada was still a loss and you wouldn’t normally expect -- that’s a reversal that I think you fully expect to see, right? That’s why I was asking about North America in this case. 
Andrew Lane: Yes, I was speaking more from the U.S. When you roll in the Canada piece, then that is a clear positive because Canada was a major deterrent, detractor from our overall North America. The Canada business, as we said, kind of -- but Canada itself is less than 10% of overall North America. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Right, so I mean, when we take into account Canada and all that, is -- I’ll just come back to my original question. I’m having a hard time, unless I’m misunderstanding something you are saying, seeing margins in North America going lower than what was posted in the second quarter. 
Andrew Lane: That’s our objective, Geoff, yes. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay, and since I have the last question, let me just come back. I want to make sure I understood what Dave said earlier. I thought you said that you would expect to see incrementals in the Eastern Hemisphere continue in the 40% range. Was that correct? 
David J. Lesar: I don’t recall that we said that, Geoff. I don’t recall that we said that. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Can you tell me what you do expect incrementals to be then? 
David J. Lesar: We had very strong incrementals in several regions this quarter. The pricing leverage is not the big driver for our international growth. It’s activity and winning new contracts, so our thought is that on our Eastern Hemisphere growth, the incrementals are more likely to be close in the 30%, I would think is a more dependable number. The 40% is driven by the sharp recoveries that we’ve seen in certain markets but on a more sustainable basis where we don’t have a lot of pricing real pops here, but any long-term contracts, that’s probably a better guidepost. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: And top line growth in the 20% to 25% range? 
David J. Lesar: We are certainly aiming 20%-plus for Eastern Hemisphere, yes. 
Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup: Thanks very much. 
Evelyn Angelle: That concludes our call for this morning. If anyone has further questions, please feel free to contact us directly. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, once again this does conclude today’s conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect at this time. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton and KBR 2006 fourth quarter conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time (Operator Instructions).  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Evelyn Angelle, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. 
Evelyn Angelle: Thank you, Matt. Good morning, and welcome to the joint Halliburton-KBR, fourth quarter 2006 Earnings Call. Since we are doing a combined call today, our prepared remarks will be a little longer than usual, but we have allowed plenty of time for questions. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on both Halliburton and KBR's website for seven days. A podcast download will also be available.  The press releases announcing the fourth quarter results are available on the Halliburton KBR website. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, Halliburton's CEO; Chris Gaut, Halliburton's CFO; Andy Lane, Halliburton's COO; Bill Utt, KBR's President and CEO and Cedric Burgher, KBR's CFO.  In today's call, Dave will provide opening remarks. Chris, will discuss our overall operating performance and financial position, followed by Andy, who will review the ESG regions and our business outlook. Bill and Cedric will address KBR operations and financial matters. We will welcome questions on both companies, after we complete our prepared remarks.  Before turning the call over to Dave, I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton and KBR's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results, and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, Halliburton's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30 2006, and recent Halliburton and current reports on Form 8-K. Risks specific to KBR are discussed in the final prospectus for its initial public offering dated November 15, 2006.In addition, please refer to the table in the Halliburton press release that reconciles as reported results to adjusted results for any non-GAAP disclosures.  Certain historical numbers related to KBR referenced in this call differs slightly from numbers set forth in KBR's earnings release issued this morning. These differences generally relate to consolidating and eliminating entries at the Halliburton level and some minor [period] adjustments that KBR reflected in their separate financial statement, during their IPO process. Now I will turn the call over to Dave Lesar, Dave.

Dave Lesar: Thank you, Evelyn, and good morning everyone. I want to focus my comments today on North America, the KBR separation and progress toward the growth goals we set out in our 2006 Analysts' Meeting. But first I would like to begin with a few highlights of our outstanding results in 2006.  With all of the noise that is out there today around gas prices in North America, its very easy to forget what an excellent year we had in accomplishing our goals, especially growing our Eastern hemisphere business. Some of the highlights of the year were our ESG revenue grew year-over-year 28%, each division in ESG had record revenue, operating income and operating income margin in 2006. Our profitability also reached record levels. Our operating income margins were over 26% for ESG and incremental margins were in excess of 38%. Operating income grew over 48% in 2006, driven by a very balanced contribution from all of our product lines.  As I mentioned earlier, our focus on the Eastern Hemisphere of ESG and its growth is reflected in our numbers. Revenue grew to nearly $5 billion, representing a 27% increase over 2005, and operating income in Eastern Hemisphere grew 49% from 2005, resulting in an operating income margins in excess of 20%.  On a sequential basis, our fourth quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenue grew by 13% and operating income grew by 27%. About half of that operating income increase was attributable to the fourth quarter gain on the sale of our lift boat operations.  Our Eastern Hemisphere contributed 41% of total ESG revenues in the fourth quarter. These results reflect the successful execution of our Eastern Hemisphere growth strategy, not just in revenue growth, but market share gains in key countries, also with a strong focus on targeting areas of geographic expansion that result in attractive returns on our assets and resources.  Our performance in Latin America was another bright area for us in 2006, where our margins improved from just over 14% in 2005 to over 19% in 2006.  In addition, our balance sheet has never been stronger. We ended the year with $4.4 billion in cash, up nearly $2 billion at the beginning of the year. That cash sets us up for strong growth in 2007, with a 40% increase in our capital expenditure budget, a 34% increase in our technology budget, and enough cash to pursue strategic acquisition. It will also allow us to continue our aggressive stock repurchase program. We refrained from purchasing shares during major transaction, such as the KBR IPO in the fourth quarter. But once we have completed the separation of KBR, you will see us back in the market aggressively buying our shares. We currently have approximately $1.7 billion left on our share purchase authorization and at year-end, we had a negative debt-to-capital ratio.  Now let me turn to what remains foremost, I believe on many of your minds and that's our outlook on the very important North American market. First, the Canadian market has softened significantly, that had a negative impact on our fourth quarter earnings for Sperry, which has the strong drilling position in Canada, and of course for our pressure pumping operations.  Our fourth quarter revenue in Canada dropped 16% on a sequential basis and our operating income even more. We certainly got hammered in this market in the fourth quarter. If the slowdown and negativity in Canada continues, we will adjust our allocation of capital in that market if necessary.  Turning to the US. We lost several workdays in December, due to the blizzards in the Rockies, where a concentration of our pumping fleet resides. As access to our customers' work sites were delayed. During and after the storms, our customers focused on getting their drilling, the production sites opened up first. That delayed them opening up the sites, which were due to be frac by us. Compounding this was the fact that the weather delays came around the holidays and in some cases our customers just shut frac work down for the balance of the year. For example, in Brighton, Colorado, where we have four frac fleets, and a large number of cementing units, we did essentially no work for the last week of the year. Because of this, the affect of weather and holidays had a much larger impact on our pumping business, than it did on our drilling related businesses.  On a broader scale, even though our pumping units were fully committed during the month. In December, we lost more than 10% of our premium frac workdays in the Rocky Mountains and the Mid-Continent. This is the equivalent of all of our frac fleets in those areas [sitting] idle on workdays, incurring all of the costs but no revenues. Therefore, it was really a weather related, not a demand related impact.  We continue to see strong demand for our services in the US, as we look into 2007. We do see some continued weather related delays in January as ice storms hit the Mid-Continent and parts of Texas and continued snowstorms in the Rockies. The good thing is that this work is not going away. It will only be deferred into later parts of this year. But overall, our customers have given us strong indications that demand for our services will remain high in 2007. Currently, rig counts are rising. Our equipment utilization rates are high, and our backlog remains strong. We continue to watch the market of course very carefully, and are in a position to react quickly to ensure capital resources continue to be deployed in the most optimal manner.  We also recognize that the volatility of the price of natural gas impacts our customer's activities, although many of our customers have favorable hedging programs in place. We believe that any weather related impact and the price of natural gas will be short lived, and if this situation occurs, will be self-correcting, as activities would slow temporarily allowing gas inventories to normalize.  In the event that some of our current customers experienced a decline in activity, we believe that our personnel and equipment will remain highly utilized, as we can expand our customer base by redeploying equipment to more active areas.  In looking at some of our most recent contract wins with major customers in the US, we have been awarded an excess of $200 million in incremental work above and over the amount of work that we performed for them in 2006. And pricing continues to improve. We also continue to experience strong demand for our services in the Eastern Hemisphere; and would consider moving equipment to markets outside of the US if necessary.  On pricing, we negotiate pricing throughout the year, either through call-out work or when contracts rollover. Call-out work continues to be favorably impacted by our July 2006 price book increases. Even in the midst of the gas price uncertainty, our recent contract negotiations have resulted in good price increases, and I emphasize "increases". Although, of course they are not as high as we've seen in the previous two years. We will continue to focus on pricing, including negotiating lower discounts, and we believe we can increase pricing in excess of the inflationary costs we expect incur in 2007, because of this we do not expect our US margins to decline in 2007.  Now I would like to take this time to emphasize the performance measures we set out for ourselves last June during the Investor Day. We said we intended to grow revenue over the course of the next three years at a compound rate of at least 20%. Our ESG revenues grew 28% from 2005 to 2006. We said we would double operating income and EPS within three years. In 2006 we increased our operating income by 48% from the prior year and we wanted to post industry leading margins already over 26% in 2006 and high returns on equity.  You can expect a lot of this growth to come from the Eastern Hemisphere, for example, contract wins in the Middle East will likely make this, one of our fastest growing markets. In Russia, we are continuing to broaden our service offerings, as western technology continues to be adopted at a strong rate, such as for our directional drilling suite of tools. And we are currently working on a number of acquisitions, having announced one, earlier this week and more should close in the next few months.  Now let me turn to KBR, for a few minutes. Our recent IPO, of approximately 19% of KBR was very successful. The shares were highly oversubscribed and KBR's stock price performed favorably. We are now working toward the final separation of KBR, which we expect to complete no later than the end of April. And we could do the transaction in one of few ways, we could spin-off the remaining KBR shares to Halliburton shareholders in the form of a dividend, or we could conduct an exchange offer in which Halliburton's shareholders have the opportunities to trade Halliburton shares for KBR shares. This is commonly called a split-off.  We believe a split-off transaction has advantages, given this current stock price relationship. First, it would allow us to effectively repurchase Halliburton shares using KBR shares as a currency. Since the KBR shares are currently trading at a higher earnings multiple than Halliburton shares, this transaction would be accretive to Halliburton's EPS, if the exchange offer were to be fully subscribed. Second, the exchange offer would give Halliburton shareholders the ability to allocate their holdings between Halliburton and KBR on a tax free basis. This could alleviate some of the potential market volatility for KBR shares that might come about in a straight spin-off transaction.  But no decision has been made at this point spin-offs have advantages as well and any decision that we make will require careful study. An assessment of market conditions at the time and getting Board approval. We expect our board to act on this by the end of February. For various legal reasons we do not expect to be commenting on this again, until we are ready to proceed with the separation, which as I said earlier we expect to complete by the end of April.  Now let me turn the call over to Chris for some further details. 
Chris Gaut: Thanks Dave and good morning. I will discuss our fourth quarter results compared sequentially to the third quarter. Halliburton Company revenue in the fourth quarter was $6 billion that's up 3% from last quarter. ESG revenue was up $117 million or 3% sequentially. I would highlight that ESG's non-North America operations showed an 11% revenue increase, with each division contributing to that increase. KBR revenue increased $69 million, reflecting an increase in gas monetization work and a slight decrease in Iraq related operations.  ESG operating income increased $53 million to $959 million, which included a $48 million gain on the sale of our non-core self elevating boat operations. Excluding the gain on the lift boat transactions ESG operating margin was 26% in the fourth quarter. Also included in ESG operating income in the fourth quarter was approximately $38 million in business interruption insurance proceeds related to the 2005 hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.  KBR reported operating income of $121 million with an operating margin of 4.8%. Income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter includes $5 million in minority interest, related to the 19% of KBR held by outside investors since the IPO in late November. The first quarter of 2007 will include the full impact of KBR's minority interest on Halliburton's income statement by the way.  Now let me highlight ESG's segment results. Production Optimization operating income increased $37 million or 9%. Included in fourth quarter results are the gains from the sales of the lift boats. Production enhancement operating income was negatively impacted by the US weather, stipulations on land usage, as well as the holidays. And there was the significant slowdown in Canada.  However, the Eastern Hemisphere was strong for production enhancement, led by high activity in Asia, the North Sea, and the Southern Persian Gulf area.  Completion Tools operating income increased significantly, reflecting strengths in international demand.  Fluid Systems operating income was relatively flat over the previous quarter. This division benefited from most of the hurricane insurance proceeds during the fourth quarter.  Cementing Services operating income decreased sequentially, particularly from the lower activity in the US land, partially offset by increased activity in Africa.  Baroid's mix of sales, particularly in West Africa, was less favorable in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Drilling Information Evaluation operating income for the fourth quarter 2006 was $230 million, that's up 1% from the third quarter, while posting an operating income margin of 26.2%.  Sperry's operating income was negatively impacted by lower activity in Canada and a less favorable mix in Asia Pacific and the North Sea. This was partially offset by Sperry's strong performance in Africa and the Middle East.  The operating income of Security DBS or Drill Bits operation increased sequentially, benefiting from the improved Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Bit sales in Europe, Africa, and Latin America.  Wireline and Perforating's operating income was up due to improvements in Latin America and in parts of Asia Pacific.  Moving to our Digital and Consulting Solutions segment, operating income improved 24% from the third quarter 2006, due primarily to Landmark's strong yearend software sales activity and growth in consulting services. The fourth quarter is always the strongest for Landmark's type of business. Bill will discuss the results for our two KBR divisions.  So, looking ahead, I would like to provide some guidance on certain 2007 Halliburton financial items, post-KBR separation. The tax rate for Halliburton should be in the 35% range in 2007. Since almost all of the third party debt remains at the Halliburton level, interest expense should be unchanged, exclusive of debt retirements. And minority interest should be in the $5 million range on a quarterly basis, again that's excluding KBR.  We are performing an analysis of the types of costs that we classify as corporate costs post-KBR separation. Without KBR and the consolidated Halliburton results, we expect to change the classification of certain stewardship costs that have historically been allocated among the segments. This will also provide better comparability in our results with our competitors. We will give you an update on that next quarter.  Capital expenditures totaled $272 million during the fourth quarter and $891 million for the full year. We expect our 2007 capital spending to be about $1.3 billion, of which $1.2 billion relates to ESG.  Our technology spent at ESG totaled $262 million during 2006 and we expect that to increase to approximately $350 million in 2007.  As Dave mentioned, our cash and short-term investments exceeds our debt, yielding a negative net debt-to-capital ratio. Andy. 
Andy Lane: Thanks Chris. Good morning, everyone. I will address regional results and our outlook. First, I would like to highlight the success of the execution of our Eastern Hemisphere growth strategy. Having achieved revenue growth of 27% year-over-year, our [approach] targets for traditional markets such as the North Sea, and emerging markets for us, such as Southeast Asia and Northern Africa. We are beginning to see the benefits of our recent investment in capital, most notably in Sperry rotary steerable tools and wireline units.  Our continued commitment to investments in infrastructure, capital, and technology are the cornerstones of our Eastern Hemisphere growth strategy.  As you know, many new rigs are being constructed for offshore applications. Our Cementing Group has been working closely with rig manufacturers and contractors, so that Halliburton's Cementing units are installed in the hulls of these rigs. We've had good success recently, which positions Halliburton favorably to perform Cementing services throughout the life of these new rigs. In 2006, Halliburton Cementing units were installed on over 40% of the new offshore rig. And so far, we have already been awarded Cementing installations on 47% of the rigs planned to be delivered in 2007.  Our Europe/Africa/CIS region is the market that shows good growth potential. Despite some constraints in the North Sea, due to rig availability. Our focus on Northern Africa, and particularly Libya, should result in a strong growth in 2007, both in revenue and profitability.  In Russia, our focus now is shifting to diversify our product and service offering. Up until recently, we have been primarily deploying pressure pumping equipment into that market.  In addition to the recent significant Rosneft pressure pumping award, yesterday we announced a large multi-year new contract with TNK-BP, in Russia, which will utilize our Cementing, Baroid, Sperry and Drill Bit products and services. Our customer has particular interest in using our unique technology, such as Sperry's EZ-Pilot and Security DBS', Energy Balanced roller cone Bits. We have also established drilling efficiency records in our Shell-Sakhalin project in Russia. And we recently introduced Pinpoint Stimulation technology for the first time in Russia.  In the fourth quarter, our Europe/Africa/CIS region showed a $113 million or 16% of revenue from last quarter. And as Chris mentioned, we sold our Nigeria and our UK base lift boat operations, in two separate transactions during the fourth quarter.  Going forward, we will have approximately $40 million to $50 million less in revenue annually as a result of these dispositions. The disposition of these non-core operations allows us to focus on developing higher growth businesses. In Africa, our Completion Tools, Cementing and Sperry Drilling Service product line benefit from the higher rig activity and increased demand for our premium service, such as Geo-Pilot, GeoTap and the high end completion tools.  Baroid results in Norway during the fourth quarter reflected the large new multiyear contract; we awarded in June from Statoil. Completion Tools results in Europe reflected -- results in Europe reflected strong sales in the UK, and high demand for our intelligent well completions through WellDynamics.  The Middle East/Asia region is another high growth area for 2007. Already large footprint in Saudi Arabia will continue to expand as work on the Khurais field ramps up. And our work in the UAE is already increasing from the significant contract win we announced, related to pressure pumping and completion tool services.  Our Middle East/Asia region fourth quarter revenue grew $48 million compared to last quarter, led by higher activity in Saudi Arabia, particularly related to the Khurais project. The Khurais project currently has slightly less than half of the rig working that we expect to be running at the peak of the project. We also experienced strong Completion Tool, Wireline and stimulation activity in Asia. Profitability in this region was negatively impacted by mobilization costs, we have experienced related to new contract awards and low utilization of the stimulation vessel in Qatar.  Now turning to the western hemisphere, Dave provided our outlook on the US market. Let me just add a few more thoughts on that topic. One thing we've been very focused on is aligning ourselves with the customers that optimizes both our efficiency and profitability. We have done that very well in the US, by working with customers, who have large pad drilling plans, will allow us to utilize our equipment at a high rate and minimize our mobilization time.  When you compare our US customer base to a recent report outlining estimated 2007 US E&P spending, the top 20, 2007 capital expenditure budgets, includes 17 of the customers in our own top 20 list of customers. Aligning ourselves with large customers, that continued to spend during times of oil and natural gas price volatility, positions us very well for continued revenue growth in this important market. We expect to see more pressure on pricing in US.  Most of our contracts contain cost escalation clauses. We will work with our customers to recover any labor and material cost increase we might experience. We also plan to continue to work down on our customer discounts.  As Dave mentioned, we're executing plans addressed to slowdown in Canada, including moving equipment to higher utilization areas. Our outlook related to heavy oil in Canada was quite positive. We expect the number of Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage wells drilled during 2007 to be twice the number of drills in 2006. We currently have a very strong position in SAGD drilling, which utilizes our Precise Well Placement services, provided by Sperry, Security DBS and Landmark. We expect to participate in the meaningful -- in the growth of the heavy oil market.  Earlier this week, we announced our plans to acquire Ultraline, a leader in cased-hole and production logging services in Canada. This acquisition is consistent with our strategy to expand our portfolio in certain geographic areas. We will be adding Halliburton's open-hole logging into Ultraline, cased-hole capability to expand a total breadth of services in Canada.  Our Latin America results were very strong in the fourth quarter posting a 7% increase in revenue, and a 16% increase in operating income.  Looking ahead to 2007, we will continue to focus on growth and improved profitability from projects in our three major operation hubs, of Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela. As highlighted by the recent award of the Pemex stimulation vessel work.  I would like to highlight two of the emerging technologies we are offering. We continue to see increased success of our Pinpoint Stimulation services, such as CobraMax and SurgiFrac. In fact, our Pinpoint Stimulation revenues increased 57% over 2005.   Baroid has recently introduced the new diesel based drilling fluid called INTEGRADE, it's based on our alkali technology which helps lower overall well construction costs by increasing penetration rates. We realized a 90% increase in the number of INTEGRADE jobs performed in the fourth quarter in deep US well applications.  Now, I will turn the call over to Bill Utt to address KBR. Bill? 
Bill Utt: Thanks Andy, and good morning everyone. Well, it has certainly been an exciting year for KBR. I am pleased to lead this organization with such a proud heritage, as we continue our preparation to begin a new chapter in our history as a standalone corporation. I am certainly very pleased with the past of public reception in the market for KBR thus far.  Everyday, I am more impressed with the dedication of KBR employees and the culture we sustain. A commitment and work ethic that drives our ability to deliver our services anytime, anywhere, often under the most extreme circumstances. This work ethic sometimes means that our employees must work in dangerous locations, on behalf of our global customer base. So, let me take this opportunity to reiterate that the safety and security of our KBR employees' is our number one priority.  Now I will review KBR's financial results. Consolidated KBR revenues for the full year 2006 totaled $9.6 billion compared to $10.1 billion during 2005. Most of the decrease relates to lower activity in Iraq. During the same period operating income decreased by $214 million, resulting in a 2.6% operating margin in 2006. Our 2006 results included a significant charge on Escravos project and impairment charges on our Australian railroad interest. I will provide an update on both of these matters in a moment. Our 2005 results included an $85 million gain on the sale of our interest in the toll road.  Now let me turn to our two segments. Energy and Chemicals posted $686 million in fourth quarter revenue, a 14% increase over the third quarter. Operating income increased 31% to $59 million during the fourth quarter. Revenues and operating income improved as a result of the higher gas monetization activity. Our focus on technology continues to differentiate us from our peers. We recently sold another technology license for our proprietary propylene technology, SUPERFLEX. This will be the second propylene unit in the world of its kind and the first one in the Asia-Pacific region. We are also contracted for two proprietary ammonia technology projects, one ROSE unit and two offshore engineering projects in the fourth quarter. This brings our ROSE licensing sales to a record eight units in 2006 and we expect demand for these proprietary heavy oil refining capabilities to increase in 2007.  Now, let me update you on a few key projects ongoing in the E&C division. The Escravos gas to liquid project in Nigeria was approximately 45% complete as of December 31. This project still has a long way to go, as we've only just begun construction activities. Since June, we have continued to experience cost increases, which have for the most part been offset by client approved change orders and reductions in our allowances and contingencies.  During the fourth quarter we reported $9 million charge related to KBR's forecast of engineering hours required to complete the project, of which a portion of these engineering hours will be non-billable due to our agreement with our partner to cap the total engineering cost we each bill to the joint venture.  Looking ahead, we believe there is a risk of further cost increases, due to uncertainties in the construction phase of this project. So, we expect we would ultimately recover most of any such cost increases from our client. However, should significant cost increases occur, there could be timing differences between the recognition of these increased costs in KBR's projections, and the recognition of offsetting revenues related to recoveries from our clients via approved change orders.  Any estimated cost increase, we are unable to recover from our clients are charged against contingencies and allowances during the period, would be recorded as a charge to income. On a more positive note, as of December 31, our levels of contingencies and allowances on the Escravos project compared to our uncommitted cost to complete the project remain at the same ratio, as we established at June 30.  Additionally, we have completed the first check estimate on the Yemen project, which was approximately 39% complete, as of yearend. No significant changes to project cost estimates were identified.  Now, all of KBR's major fixed price projects have completed this important project review milestone. Finally, the Amenas Gas project in Algeria, has achieved commercial operation as we successfully completed our project performance tests.  Shifting to our other division, the Government and Infrastructure division, fourth quarter revenues of $1.8 billion were essentially flat to the third quarter, with a slight decline in our Iraq related work. Operating income for the division grew $8 million to $61 million in the fourth quarter. The third quarter included a $32 million impairment charge on the Australian railroad investment. The fourth quarter included a $12 million charge on an embassy construction project in Macedonia, in which we experienced an escalation and labor and material costs. This decrease was offset by favorable partial settlement on the container-related issue and higher income from the DML shipyard, largely related to the completion of a project.  Let me provide an update on our LOGCAP-4. During the fourth quarter, we reached a favorable partial settlement on the outstanding container issue. We expect the balance of the container issue to be resolved during the first half of 2007. The recent troop search in Iraq has caused us to increase our hiring. We expect our revenues to be modestly impacted by the increase in troop count during 2007.  Our customer, the US Army, has recently indicated they expect to announce the award of the LOGCAP-4 contract by the end of the first quarter and begin re-competing past quarters in the June and July timeframe.  As you recall, the current expectation is that the LOGCAP-4 contract will be divided among three contractors. You may have seen some press on KBR and our DML investment in the UK. We have received inquiries related to purchasing KBR's interest in DML. We plan to evaluate these inquiries, but currently have made no decisions regarding our interest in DML.  In the meantime, DML showed strong results throughout 2006. We have provided the UK Ministry of Defence, the financial information they have requested with respect to KBR as a standalone entity.  Additionally, Halliburton continues to guarantee KBR's performance under the DML agreement.  An agreement on the [AST] railroad investment was recently reached with the project lenders. There is now a bank settlement agreement in place, which restructures the joint ventures' debt and delays the principal payments for the next few years. No additional impairment charges were taken during the fourth quarter related to this venture.  Finally, let me update you on our management restructuring efforts. I began this effort in the third quarter, and together with my leadership team I have continued to define the organizational structure and activities between the corporate staff and the business units. These corporate changes have been designed to enhance risk awareness and transparency, as well as improve KBR's financial performance, all critical to continue the momentum reflected in our recent results.  We have recorded a charge of $5 million in the fourth quarter related to this restructuring and to cover the charges for reductions enforced, which were necessary in some areas, as we optimize our structure around the KBR workload and processes. I expect that we may be announcing further charges in 2007, as we continue to review KBR and its cost structure to deliver our services to our costumers.  Let me close by providing you our outlook on some of the E&C markets in which we participate. Worldwide resource constraints, escalating material and equipment prices, and ongoing supply chain pricing pressures are causing delays, and in some cases, cancellations of major gas monetization and upstream prospects.  Delays in the awarding of these projects may negatively impact our first half of 2007, as we are expecting some of these projects to be awarded during 2006 and in early 2007. We continue to believe, however, we will win our share of these projects, as they are ultimately awarded.  Additionally, other awards in the Energy and Chemicals division, like the recent fourth quarter wins I discussed a moment ago and the additional work related to the troop search in Iraq, should mitigate the impact of the expected delays in gas monetization and upstream projects awards.  Now let's turn to Cedric for more details on KBR. 
Cedric Burgher: Thanks Bill. I would like to begin with the discussion of backlog. Our recent contracts have been more heavily weighted toward reimbursable work, instead of pure lump sum turnkey. This has been official in terms of reducing risk in our backlog, but it also has the effect of driving overall backlog numbers lower.  For example, some cost reimbursable contracts, particularly in our Energy and Chemical segment, call for KBR to provide procurement management services on behalf of the customer rather than the actual procurement of materials.  In the case of procurement management, KBR does not include the cost of the material in either backlog or revenue. The Energy and Chemical division's backlog as of December 31 was $5.7 billion, as compared to $6 billion at the end of September. The Government and Infrastructures division's backlog as of December 31 was $7.8 billion, compared to $9 billion at the end of the third quarter.  Backlog for the fourth quarter was reduced primarily due to the significant work-off on our LOGCAP-3 contract. The size of projects that we add -- that we expect to add to our backlog should continue to decline, as we expect to see our customers agreeing to absorb certain cost items within these projects as opposed to paying KBR to take these risks including our expected cost-for-market volatilities and contingencies.  Now, let's review other financial items. General and administrative expenses included in operating income, increased by $23 million to $108 million in 2006. The majority of which is attributable to the implementation of a new ERP system, and costs associated with being a standalone company. We expect our general and administrative costs to average around $30 million per quarter during 2007.  Our net interest income in the fourth quarter was $14 million, as compared to $1 million a net interest expense in the third quarter. The improvement resulted from KBR paying-off debt in the fourth quarter with the proceeds from the IPO. In addition, the higher cash balance positively impacted interest income.  In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 49%, this relatively high rate was driven by our return-to-accrual adjustments and the inability to credit foreign taxes, as a member of the Halliburton, US consolidated group. We estimate KBR's effective tax rate in 2007 will be approximately 38%, as we will begin utilizing foreign tax credits in the US.  With respect to earnings guidance, like Halliburton, we believe it is best practice not to provide specific guidance.  Now, I would like to discuss our liquidity and balance sheet. Our balance sheet remained strong, with cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion at the end of December. With our net IPO proceeds of $508 million and cash generated during the year, we repaid our $774 million note due to Halliburton during 2006, and ended 2006 with total debt of $20 million.  Debt should remain negligible throughout 2007. Our overall working capital at the end of the quarter was $915 million, which includes working capital related to our government services work in the Middle East of $248 million. We continue to make good progress in reducing our working capital in the Middle East, which decreased by $84 million compared to our prior quarter. For the full year 2006, our Middle East working capital reduced by $247 million to $248 million balanced at the end of the year.  Capital expenditures totaled $7 million during the fourth quarter 2006, and $57 million during the full year. Depreciation was $15 million during the fourth quarter and $47 million for the full year. For 2007, we expect our capital expenditures to total approximately $95 million and depreciation to be approximately $57 million.  In the fourth quarter, KBR adopted the FAS-158 new pension accounting rules. As a result of the adoption at December 31, total assets decreased by $208 million, total liabilities increased by $45 million, minority interest decreased by $98 million, and shareholder's equity decreased by $155 million.  Now, I will turn the call back over to Dave Lesar for his final remarks. Dave? 
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Cedric. It has been a lot of information we've drawn out today, but let me just summarize, where I see we are. First of all, after over two years of very concentrated efforts, we're now only a couple of months away from the complete separation of Halliburton and KBR. We still believe that the complete separation will unlock additional shareholder value. At Halliburton, we look forward to focusing all of our energy on implementing our growth strategy as a peer oilfield services company. We continue to grow our already strong position in the Eastern Hemisphere, and we will maximize our position in the US, through up and down markets. But overall, we still see a very strong global demand for our products and services through the end of the decade.  We will now open it up for questions. Please limit your comments to one question and one follow-up. 
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Geoff Kieburtz of Citigroup. Your question please. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: Good morning. I wondered, if you could talk a little bit about the capital spending plans for 2007 and for [PSG] and where you see that being concentrated? 
Chris Gaut: Sure, Geoff. This is Chris. Well, the $1.2 billion of capital spending that we see in 2007, which is a significant increase over 2006. That increase is going to almost -- will very largely go to our Eastern Hemisphere operations, and the biggest recipient of the increase will be in our Drilling Information Evaluation sector. That will be complemented by a good increase in our fluid space, where we have a good number wins on cementing units or new offshore rigs and refurbished offshore rigs and as we build out our bulk plans for our [Bahrain] operations. Andy, you want to add anything to that. 
Andy Lane: Yes, Geoff. Chris said it, both were very Eastern focused for growth, while some infrastructure for the project wins, but also just pure service equipment and expansions in Eastern Hemisphere and a lot more balance than we have had in the past weighted towards the Drilling, Sperry's business, the Bits business and also the wireline business and specially Sperry Downhole Tool systems and wireline trucks we mentioned, have a big investment going there and we are going to continue that. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: As my follow-up, if we take out the benefit of the business interruption? Fluids had a pretty steep margin erosion in the fourth quarter. Is that any cause for concern? 
Chris Gaut: Well, Geoff, some of it is mix of jobs that we had in the Eastern Hemisphere. Cementing of course, was impacted a very heavily by what we talked about, the weather and the holiday impact both in the US and impacted significantly in Canada. So we know where the issues are both in Cementing and in the Baroid mix of businesses and we still think it's doing very well and the outlook is still very strong for both of those business. Most of our Eastern Hemisphere wins have a component of Cementing and Baroid in those and we are investing a lot in the mobilization costs, to get ready for those contracts, but we feel very good about those contracts going forward. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: So you are expecting just a rebound in the immediate future? 
Chris Gaut: Yes, we are still mobilized, Geoff. As you know, with the Eastern Hemisphere project wins that go over multiple years and take us one or two quarters to get fully mobilized on the costs. So we definitely expect them to rebound in 2007. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question is from James Stone of UBS, your question please. 
James Stone - UBS: Good morning, Dave I appreciate your comments on spilt off or spin-off. Can I just ask you a clarification? If you do a split-off and it is not fully subscribed, do you still have the ability to distribute the remaining shares on a tax-free basis? 
Dave Lesar: Yes, the mechanics of the split-off is that it is, if it is less than fully subscribed but more than the minimum then the remainder number of KBR shares would be distributed through a pro-rata dividend and the whole thing would be tax-free. Those are the mechanics. 
James Stone - UBS: Okay. And Andy just as a follow-up, you said pricing in the US will remain under pressure, but Dave said pricing -- price gains would exceed inflation growth. Can you guys just reconcile those two statements? 
Dave Lesar: Yeah Jamie this is Dave. You know, obviously the last couple of years we have had double-digit price increases, Jim. So, those double-digit ability is what has come under pressure, but I think for those that are concerned that pricing has fallen off the cliff in North America, we just don't see that happening. And so yes we are getting price increases, they are not as good as they have been in the last couple of years, but they are price increases. And what is under pressure of course, is we are asking for more than we are getting, and we are getting more pushback than what 0we would have got in the last couple of years, but that doesn't mean that we are not being successful in getting increases. 
James Stone - UBS: That's very helpful thanks. 
Operator: Your next question is from Jim Wicklund of Banc of America. Your question please. 
Jim Wicklund - Banc of America Securities: Hey guys. As a follow-up, we have talked in the past about how your payback on adding new frac spreads in the US is 12 months in all. Have you guys looked to see what normalized returns on that business will or should be? 
Chris Gaut: Sure Jim. When we look at investment in pressure pumping spread, we certainly assume its going to last a very long time and so we do look at that over a full cycle and do try to normalize the returns. And we certainly see that the returns that we would be getting would exceed our hurdles of a 15% after-tax return un-leveraged. It certainly -- the results -- the economics we run on new investments currently are helped by the fact that we have such a strong market right in this environment, but on a full cycle basis even if one normalize the numbers. Its, we think it's quite attractive. 
Jim Wicklund - Banc of America Securities: Okay. And my follow up if I could, my E&P analyst this morning lowered his -- he has definitely lowered his gas price forecast in the US. Nobody knows what gas prices are going to be, because nobody knows the weather. But just generally, I assume you guys are looking for the US rig count to increase this year. I guess is that true and are you all looking at a gas price to drive that level of activity. 
Chris Gaut: Well, I think there are two things that are going on. One of the important things is a change in the mix of rigs in the US land market, where we have a large number of new, more efficient rigs coming on, which will be drilling more wells. I think we are agnostic on the rig count itself, clearly with these new rigs coming on, we could be drilling more wells. What we are seeing from our customer base is significant activity. Dave referenced the number of new contracts that -- new commitments that we are winning. So, we see a very active frac market in front of us, fully utilizing, as we see that the market today, fully utilizing our available equipments and -- 
Jim Wicklund - Banc of America Securities: So they should matter? 
Chris Gaut: Yeah. 
Jim Wicklund - Banc of America Securities: Okay, very helpful. Thanks guys. 
Operator: Your next question is from Scott Gill of Simmons & Company. Your question please. 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: Yes, good morning gentlemen. Andy, did I hear you say that you would consider moving equipment out of Canada into the US, and if that's true, what type of equipments are you considering moving here? 
Andy Lane: Yes Scott, it is what we are considering. We know we are going to have a good first quarter compared to the fourth quarter we feel. As historically, the first quarter is a strong quarter in Canada. So we aren't considering anything to move in the short-term. But, of course, the second quarter with the spring breakup we have every year, and then the outlook after the winter and gas prices outlook for the second half for Canada. We are certainly going to take all that in account. And it would be primarily pumping equipment, first -- to look at moving it either to better utilization, higher price markets here in the US or Eastern Hemisphere. 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: Any thought to -- I guess the question could come up, if you did move the equipment from Canada into the US, would that exacerbate the pricing pressure, so kind of what's the process with respect to pricing in the US, and how that might impact where you ultimately move that equipment? 
Andy Lane: Yes Scott, we don't see the type and amount of equipment we are talking about. We don't see it having a negative impact on the pricing in the US. It's not that type of scaled movement. And we wouldn't that, we would -- we feel very good about our pricing, as they went through in the US and the demand for our service in the US. If we were to be over utilized there, we would move to Eastern Hemisphere. So, first, we are going to maximize the market and activity level in the US, but we're positioned along with our new capital builds that Chris talked about. We're always looking at growth opportunities for the Eastern Hemisphere. 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: Okay. Thanks and one last one, if I can squeeze it in here, Chris. What was the percent of revenue from Canada during the fourth quarter? 
Chris Gaut: Sorry Scott. We don't breakout our North America segments by practice. So unfortunately I can't do that in this case. 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Next question is from Dan Pickering of Pickering Energy Partners, your question. 
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: Hey guys. I was hoping that you could -- as we look at the revenue decline in North America, just want to make sure I understand kind of our math would say that it looks like about half of the sequential decline came from Canada, the rest came from US, and I was just wondering if there was any -- one, is that close to accurate, and two, do we isolate the US piece of the business, primarily the pressure pumping? 
Chris Gaut: Yeah, I mean the first one is similar to the question that Scott just asked and so I can't give you more granularity on the breakdown between US and Canada just because that's not our practice or the precedent that we want to set. Now, yes, certainly our biggest business in North America is our production enhancement business. So, it is definitely fair to say that just because of the size and scale of that business, it has felt -- it had the biggest impact of the activity reduction in Canada and in our very large market position we have in the Rockies in the US. 
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: Thank you. Unrelated question for Bill and Cedric, please. Bill, you mentioned that there may be some delays in some of these larger projects that you are looking at for KBR. I think around the road show timing, you had mentioned something like a bidding environment out there, it was about $20 billion or so projects that you were looking at that might come to fruition. Has that number changed much in the last few months? 
Bill Utt: Not materially. We still see generally the same list of prospects out there and the delays we are seeing are really driven by our customers' desire to absorb the information and that is communicated to us in our pricing related to the supply chain pricing pressures that we see, but the overall outlook in terms of the number of project is still where we thought it was back at the road show. 
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: Okay. So, they are not going away. They are just slipping a bit. 
Bill Utt: I would characterize that as being correct, yes. 
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from Brad Handler of Wachovia. Your question please. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Thanks. Good morning everybody. Could I ask you first on the Halliburton side please, just another sort of financial detail question. If we look at the Middle East/Asia margin, it is down by a couple hundred basis points. You guys have spoken to the drivers there, but can you perhaps split up how much of that do you think was due to infrastructure kind of ramping, versus how much was due to product mix? 
Chris Gaut: Yeah, I think that the ramping up for new contracts was certainly a part of that. In the Middle East, we have a number of things underway. It was also some mix effect that we had in our fluids business that had an impact as well. 
Andy Lane: Yeah, Brad the main ramp up is of course is Al Khurais project, our UAE project that we talked about with Cementing, and we've had several wins in Total -- for [Total] in Indonesia, that are ramping up in the Asia area. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: I don't know, if it's just too -- if I am getting too granular. Just given that three quarters of that mix is a quarter or something? 
Chris Gaut: That would be hard to -- 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Hard to break? 
Chris Gaut: Yeah. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Fair enough, okay. If I could ask unrelated follow-up on the KBR side, please, you have historical information by segments within both divisions. Can you give us that information on the call here now? 
Cedric Burgher: We don't have the material ready for the call; we will have it in our filing and so we will provide it at that time. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Okay, fair enough. 
Bill Utt: In the 10-K. 
Cedric Burgher: Correct. 
Brad Handler - Wachovia: Good enough. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Our next question is from Geoff Kieburtz of Citigroup. Your question please. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: Oh gosh, I got cycled around rather quickly, didn't I? What I wanted to ask was in terms of your technology spend, could you talk a little bit about what the mix concentration is there? 
Andy Lane: Yes, Geoff, well, it's up roughly 50% on development and 20% on research, you see from a broad standpoint, the rest balance being more operational engineering. So, that's the mix and then it's equally split between our divisions and that has been very consistent for several years, so we have ramped up both -- in Sperry, in Landmark and in both cementing and fracturing. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay. And on the CapEx, is there any segment of your CapEx that you think would be reduced in 2007 versus 2006? 
Andy Lane: Yeah, our US production enhancement spending is down in 2007 compared to 2006 as we've said before. Both -- and that's not news, we’ve said that before and that remains our plans, yeah. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: Any other segment? 
Chris Gaut: No. 
Dave Lesar: I don't think so Geoff. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Next question is from John Rogers of D. A. Davidson. Your question please. 
John Rogers - D. A. Davidson: Hi, good morning. Bill, I am curious on the margins for the energy and chemicals business. They were substantially higher than they have been for some time, you noted one close out charge there, were there any other unusual gains in the quarter or was it just timing of projects? 
Bill Utt: The one we point out would be the -- would be in GNI where we had a contract closed at DML, which gave us a base in the completion of a submarine project that gave us a bump in the fourth quarter, and also the partial settlement on containers, which was also contributing to the strong margins we had in the fourth quarter, beyond -- 
John Rogers - D. A. Davidson: And some of the containers Bill, you mean related to Iraq one of the --? 
Bill Utt: Right 
John Rogers - D. A. Davidson: One of the issues that has been raised by the auditors that is now in the process are being resolved? 
Bill Utt: That's correct, this was part of the DCA audits that we periodically go through and we are successfully working through the container issue as I mentioned we will have the full issue we believe resolved during the first half of '07, and we continue to make good progress on all fronts with the DCA and those discussions. We had a couple of FEED projects that finished up at the end of the year, which you had a little bit impact but not to the degree we saw with the DML results and the partial settlement on containers. 
John Rogers - D. A. Davidson: Okay, then the FEED projects -- but on the energy and chemical side I was referring to just because. 
Bill Utt: Well, on the energy and chemical side we had some restructurings within the Bonny Island project Trains 4 and 5 and then the 26 project. While they did have a positive impact on operating impact did get backed out in minority interest, so that the net effect here on the bottom line at KBR was zero. 
John Rogers - D. A. Davidson: Okay. And then on the charges that you mentioned potentially restructuring in 2007 on the management side? Can you give us a sense of magnitude there? 
Bill Utt: Not right now, we take a fairly thorough and thoughtful view with discreet aspects of our business and as we talked about on the road show. One of the activities we undertook from the -- in the third quarter and then in the fourth quarter was review the human resource service and delivery side for KBR. And yeah, we took a couple of months and we thoughtfully looked at what we were doing and we were able to reduce our annual spend on HR cost from $30 million a year to 20. We certainly didn’t have any targets going into that exercise with respect to the savings we could achieve. But we are able to, you know very positively realign the cost and support activities of HR within KBR. We expect, as we move to other discrete sectors in '07 that we could see continued reductions in our overheads within the company. 
John Rogers - D. A. Davidson: Thank you. 
Operator: The next question is from Daniel Henriques of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. 
Daniel Henriques - Goldman Sachs: Hi good morning. My question is to go back on the Eastern Hemisphere margins, how should we think about it in terms of timing you mentioned some startup costs and mobilization cost. Is that like a gradual improvement over the course of the years that at some point there is a step up, how should we think about that? 
Dave Lesar: Yeah Daniel, I wouldn't think of a big step up, because it's a very large business Northern Hemisphere and we are talking about isolated projects that we want. But they are the big projects, the Statoil win for Cementing and Baroid, the Middle East wins and the Asia wins, we talked about previously. So, there won't be a big step over gradual improvement as those projects get mobilized and ramped up to full profitability. 
Andy Lane: And the mix effect which is also important, just had some volatility from period-to-period. 
Daniel Henriques - Goldman Sachs: And on the Khurais project, how much of Khurais is already in your numbers? 
Andy Lane: Well, all of the projects that's occurred, but it's a as we said to let than half the full activity. So as you know when we announce that we expected, in excess of 20 rigs working at full -- at full activity levels and so we are less than half of that right now at the end of the year. And its just part of the process that Saudi Aramco is going through to ramp up that project. But they are going fully forward with it. And so we are active on in an 8 to 10 rig range. 
Daniel Henriques - Goldman Sachs: Okay and Chris this is for you in terms of capital structure you obviously still have a very un-levered balance sheet. What do you think is an ideal capital structure and how do you think you get there? 
Chris Gaut: Well, an ideal capital structure would not be net -- zero net debt that is true. Now, we do have a fair amount of debt on the balance sheet excluding the cash were 27%, 28% debt to total capital, which we would think be approaching of an optimal capital structure. So, really the issue is we have a lot of cash that we have been generating in the business. So, what do we do with that and we have identified that we want to grow internally through expanding our capital expenditures and we've been adding capital to our operations about as quickly as we think our operations can absorb it. We will spend the cash on acquisitions and we expect that to be at least $1 billion a year and we're off on that program and then most of the remainder we see going towards returning to the shareholders principally through a share repurchase program that started at a billion and then was augmented with another 2 billion. So, that’s how we see we can move towards more of an optimal capital structure but when we think about our priorities, our priorities are first making sure we invest the cash wisely and getting the best return rather than just doing something in order to get to that optimal capital structure as quickly as possible. 
Daniel Henriques - Goldman Sachs: It just looks that even if spend $1 billion budget I think you establish for annually for acquisitions plus your CapEx it's still has -- you still have a lot left over. Should we think about buyback as gradual thing overtime or do you think that there's a space for doing something like faster to move to from more efficient capital structure? 
Dave Lesar: That's part of our value evaluation relative to acquisition opportunities. That would be a factor but I think having the cash balance we have gives the company the flexibility to look at a number of different things and also be well positioned whatever the future course of oil and gas prices is. 
Daniel Henriques - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. 
Operator: The next question is from Robin Schumacher of Bear Stearns, your question please. 
Robin Schumacher - Bear Stearns: Yes, thank you. I wondered if have a sense as you do for your US customers about their plans for '07, if you have any similar feedback from your Canadian customers especially what may transpire their after this spring breakup if you expect that market to rebound or if it will remain weak, or do you know? 
Chris Gaut: Robin, we know what they, the once that are released publicly and we know through our contacts with them. They are pretty much in the same position -- many and we are. Looking at the market they are going to have an active first quarter plan not as big a rig count as it was in the first quarter of 2006 but very more active than in the fourth quarter of last year and then of course the breakup and they are going to evaluate the pricing at that point. We see a good market in Canada. We just don’t know how strong it will be. And we’re going to follow their announcements very closely. 
Robin Schumacher - Bear Stearns: Okay. Just one clarification on this split-off potential. You've indicated here in your press release, you spent 1.3 billion so far on share repurchases out of the 3 billion authorization, now was the split-off, if you reduce shares that way, does anyway that count against this repurchase authorization, or is that totally separate? 
Chris Gaut: No, Robin, it would be -- the additional authorization would be additive to the shares that we would bring in if we proceeded with the split-off. So I think what you do is take the estimate of what we would bring in by the split-off plus the billion seven and then we would look at on going back to the board for more, if we continue to see ourselves undervalued and the cash flow is strong as we anticipate. 
Dave Lesar: Robin, we would reiterate that decision on the form of the separation has not been made. 
Robin Schumacher - Bear Stearns: Right. Okay, thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from Kurt Hallead of RBC. Your question please. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC: Hi, good morning. The question related to the -- can you give us the revenue number that was associated with the asset sale that were made in the quarter, so if you had impact of $48 million on operating income, can you just give us some idea that revenue and operating income for that business that was sold? 
Dave Lesar: Yes, Kurt, as we -- I think we've covered it in a minute ago, there was 40 million to 50 million annually. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC: That's a revenue number, right? 
Dave Lesar: That's a revenue number for the two best close, one of the two best in process, two transactions, one of that was in UK and the rest was in Nigeria. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC: What was the operating income associated with them? 
Dave Lesar: Well, we do not want to get too granular here relative to people who bought those businesses and so forth and so we don't allocate out all the cost to those businesses. So no one give you a gross margin business, gross margin estimate in new business. But I think with that range of revenue, Kurt, you can make some best estimates, I wouldn't say that that business is materially different in its margin potential and others. 
Kurt Hallead - RBC: Okay. Alright, thank you. 
Operator: Your next question is from Pierre Conner of Capital One. Your question please. 
Pierre Conner - Capital One: I would say you have covered all my questions. Thanks guys. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Barry Bannister of Stifel Nicolaus. Your question please. 
Robert Connors - Stifel Nicolaus: Good morning. This is actually Robert Connors of Stifel Nicolaus. Barry had to run and jump on the Caterpillar Call. But my question was for Bill Utt and regarding KBR. And can you provide more color on how a shift away from fixed price contracting may have affected the E&C segment only bookings growth in the quarter, and also going forward? 
Bill Utt: The comments that Cedric and I made regarding the E&C bookings, go back on a backlog basis to what risks that we are taking and how that, you know, what goes through our books and what doesn't. We have seen an evolution from a model that existed at KBR regarding full lump-sum turnkey contracts, to an increased level of granularity regarding the various risks of performing home office services, construction, and procurement materials. And we see with our customers were developing a much richer and more robust discussion about how we are pricing our products and services, particularly given the escalations that we've seen in the last several months towards our supply chain. And so we are finding that with these volatilities that are now exist in our supply chain that our customers are increasingly looking to take those on their side of the ledger and not have KBR provided contingency or a volatility risk premium in our service offering. Now that would have the effect of moving us down to where we are in some cases looking only at home office services that we would underwrite on a fixed price basis for the same project that two years ago we might have taken under a full lump sum turnkey. And as we look at that, you will see as we move forward that the contributions to backlog from these projects may only be 25% or 30% of what they were because of the greater degree of pass through of these procured items et cetera colluded to in his call. 
Robert Connors - Stifel Nicolaus: Okay. Thank you. And on in another note, is there any sort of change in your backlog burn rate going forward at a year ago from various Halliburton and KBR filings, which say the burn rate going forward like G&I was about 76% and in E&C was about 51%, are you guys still within range? 
Chris Gaut: I don’t have it by percent, but I can tell you I don’t think it works that neatly in terms of year-over-year rate that really is project driven. The biggest issue for the quarter end for the year was the decrease in or the work-off in our LOGCAP-3 contract and that was $1.1 billion net reduction for the quarter. Also in the unfunded category, that also was a $1.1 billion decrease, all in the GNI area from $3.1 billion to $2 billion. 
Robert Connors - Stifel Nicolaus: But that has a shorter time horizon? 
Dave Lesar: It does. You have to remember on the road show, we've talked about the transition task order that we received from the government, as they were competing LOGCAP, for they took our performance of task order 139 out through at the end of August of 2007. And we clearly have been working that backlog off and the funding of that project continues, but we haven't seen subsequent awards related to task order 139, because we have gotten it at the time as we discussed an extraordinarily longer commitment of work under task order 139, it's during the third quarter. 
Andy Lane: The history there has been that with the government on the LOGCAP contract as we get shorter term backlog. 
Robert Connors - Stifel Nicolaus: Somewhat just in time. 
Andy Lane: Yeah, so that's goes to support the numbers you have there, right. 
Bill Utt: On the E&C side, the reduction on a quarter basis was just under 10% and that represents work off in really of our major gas monetization projects. There is seven or eight to talk about. Only significant increase we put out in the press release was related to the [Sakhalin] project, which we booked in the fourth quarter, as offset to that reduction. 
Evelyn Angelle: Now, let's take one more question. 
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Mike Urban of Deutsche Bank. Your question please. 
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank: Thanks, good morning. One or two follow-up on the acquisition side, it just a little bit earlier. But you've made one here recently and looks like there is some others teed up. Any particular product line, region, technology that you're looking to fill out? In other words, any themes out there? Or is it more opportunistic? 
Andy Lane: Obviously, we're not going to give you the list, the target. 
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank: Sure. 
Andy Lane: But, mainly the things that we are looking at are associated with our drilling information evaluation business or other downhole tools, technology and equipment. We're focused on expanding our products and technology, and we're also as we’ve said, from a much broader perspective looking to grow our non-North America business. So, those would be some of the priorities that are built into the deals that we're working on. 
Dave Lesar: Yeah Mike. And Ultraline fits well, as you may or may not know we do not have a presence today in our wireline business in Canada. So, we offered a broadening of that portfolio in Canada, business where we know very well, and it’s a good addition everything else we have in Canada. So, also as we said and Chris covered, we're looking for geographic addition where there is a market share position we like, we are in a presence that we don’t have at the level we want. And those are good acquisitions [that end to us] and we know the business, they integrate well. And so, we're definitely looking at those in several markets. 
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank: And it seems like that the deal flow has picked up here a little bit as that function of being further down the road on KBR or have valuations become more attractive, there's a little bit of a turmoil in the market? 
Andy Lane: I think evaluations are an important point in discussions between buyers and sellers getting together. 
Mike Urban - Deutsche Bank: Okay. That's all from me. Thanks. 
Evelyn Angelle: Alright, great. I want to thank everyone for participating and their insightful comments and questions. Both KBR and ESG management will be available the rest of the day for those of you who didn't get all your questions answered. So, feel free to call us. That concludes our call. Thank you, all. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2006 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.  (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Ms. Evelyn Angelle, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. 
Evelyn Angelle: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, and welcome to Halliburton's third quarter 2006 earnings release conference call. Today’s call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our website for seven days. A podcast download will also be available on our website.  Joining me today are: Dave Lesar; our CEO, Chris Gaut; our CFO; Andy Lane; our COO; and Bill Utt, the President and CEO of KBR.  The press release announcing our third quarter results is available on our website.  In today’s call, Dave will provide opening remarks, Chris will discuss our overall operating performance and financial position, followed by Andy, who will review the ESG regions and our business outlook. Bill will address KBR operations. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks.  Before turning the call over to Dave, I would like to remind our audience that some of today’s comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting the company’s view about future events and their potential impact on our performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact the company’s operations and financial results, and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements.  These risks are discussed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, and recent current reports on Form 8-K.  Today, we will be giving you an update on the IPO of KBR. Any sale of KBR Inc. stock under a Form S-1 would be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, and such shares of common stock would only be offered and sold by means of a prospectus. This earnings conference call does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of any offer to buy any securities of KBR.  Now, I will turn the call over to Dave Lesar. Dave. 
David J. Lesar: Thank you, Evelyn, and good morning, everyone. We had another record quarter in our energy services business, and we believe that the momentum should continue into the fourth quarter and beyond. We will discuss these results in detail with you in a minute, but first I would like to address the issues that I believe are on top of everybody’s mind -- KBR and our outlook on the North American market.  We are continuing to work through the KBR IPO process. Since we spoke with you in July, the market for IPOs has improved. Therefore, if we are able to finalize the SEC review process with respect to the Form S-1 within the next few weeks, we expect to complete an IPO of just under 20% of KBR’s outstanding shares. This would be followed by a spin-off of the remaining shares to Halliburton shareholders no later than April of 2007. If we are unable to proceed with the IPO before the end of the year, we would expect to spin-off 100% of KBR to Halliburton shareholders in the early part of 2007. Again, this would be no later than April.  Let me shift to the Energy Services Group. As you know, the coalbed methane market in Western Canada began to be impacted by softness in the price of natural gas. However, we have seen no other widespread impact on demand or pricing in our pressure pumping services in North America.  We have the base of knowledge, the customer base, the technology, and the experience to successfully work our way through any near-term concerns. Demand for our services in North America continues to be strong. The reality today is Halliburton currently does not have enough capacity to serve all the customers seeking our pressure pumping services in North America. If some of our current customers were to decrease their activities, it would allow us to go to work for others. If this were to occur, we might experience some downtime or mobilization costs during this transition period. We believe we will be able to keep our equipment and people highly utilized.  Also, if natural gas drilling were to decrease, we expect to see our customers shift their focus to drilling oil wells in the near-term, rather than letting the rigs go unutilized.  Now, let me give you some examples of how we effectively reallocate our equipment and workforce in order to react to changes in the market.  We recently, for example, addressed a pricing and utilization issue with a major customer in the Rockies by redeploying our frac fleet to other major customers. This allowed us to realize improved pricing while displacing a competitor. We are also redeploying frac fleets to the MidCon area, to address additional demand from our existing customers. We are also considering sending another fleet to Canada, where our business is focused not in the shallow gas markets but in the deeper areas, such as the foothills.  We believe we will be at least able to continue posting our historical high margins, because we have enough demand for our services to keep our fleets fully utilized, even if it means moving equipment to other areas.  Most of our customer contracts contain cost escalation clauses that allow us to pass cost increases along to our customers. For those customers that do not have escalation clauses, that work is priced on a call-out basis and inflationary costs are already priced in.  We spent a lot of time discussing our near-term outlook for North America with our customers. Other than the shallow and coalbed methane wells in Western Canada, we have seen and heard only limited instances of customers actually shutting down production temporarily until the natural gas price comes back up. So far, this has not impacted our volume. However, in the event that drilling activity does decline, or more production is shut down, our view is that this would rather quickly reduce gas production and allow gas storage to come down sufficiently to bring natural gas markets back into balance, perhaps within one or two quarters.  But this is only a hypothetical, so I would encourage you -- do not discount our excellent North America gas position and reservoir knowledge. We believe our equipment will be working when others are not.  With the softness in natural gas prices and lower oil prices, we know there is an increase on Wall Street that this cycle is slowing. We certainly do not believe that is the case. Our outlook over the next several years remains very robust. Worldwide demand for hydrocarbons continues to grow, and the reservoirs are becoming more and more complex. This is translating to increased demand for oil field services, particularly those services that reduce drilling time and increase production rates.  With that outlook, let me focus on operations. ESG has posted a year-to-date 30% revenue growth compared to the first nine months of 2005. Our operating margins continue to climb. We have posted a 25.7% operating income margin for the first nine months, compared to 22.1% in the same period a year ago.  Another of our goals we have visited with you on is to achieve industry-leading returns on equity. Halliburton's consolidated return on equity for the first nine months of 2006, on an annualized basis, was 32%. Excluding KBR, this figure increases by approximately 7 percentage points.  Now, some highlights from the third quarter.  ESG posted record revenue in the third quarter, with sequential growth of $276 million, or 9%. Production optimization, fluid systems, drilling information evaluation all contributed with record revenue. Within these divisions, all major product services lines posted record revenues.  ESG also achieved record operating income and grew operating income at 14.5% on a sequential basis, better than the 9% revenue growth we saw sequentially.  Operating income margins were 26.7%, a 130 basis point sequential improvement. Our incremental margins for the quarter were 42%.  Our commitment to Eastern Hemisphere growth and profitability continues to pay dividends, as both regions in the Eastern Hemisphere posted record revenue, despite a $9 million impact from the strikes in Norway. The Middle East-Asia region had record operating income, while Europe-Africa was just shy of its record.  From a product service line standpoint, Sperry operating income grew 39% sequentially, which was heavily impacted by improvements in the Middle East.  Once again, the Eastern Hemisphere showed improved margins, with just over a 21% operating income margin, even with the mobilization costs we are currently incurring to ramp up our Eastern Hemisphere activity.  We continue to win large projects in the Eastern Hemisphere. We have recently been awarded two contracts in Indonesia, for a total of $110 million, and a $70 million project in the UAE for cementing and stimulation services.  I am also proud of our Latin America region, which posted record revenue and operating income, with a strong, sequential 40% incremental margin. All four divisions contribute positively to the results in Latin America.  From a company perspective, let me highlight a couple of other points.  KBR backlog continues to strengthen. It increased $4 billion this quarter to a record $15 billion. With the addition of the cutter, gas to liquids project, and task order 139 under our LOGCAP-3 contract.  Halliburton's cash position remains extremely strong. We are still pursuing our strategy of $1 billion to $2 billion in acquisitions annually, and are currently looking at a number of options. However, we still feel the best investment is in ourselves, having spent about $1 billion on share repurchases, with an additional $2 billion recently added to that authority.  With that, let me turn the call over to Chris, and he will go over more operational details. 
C. Christopher Gaut: Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I will discuss our third quarter results, compared sequentially to the second quarter.  Halliburton company revenue in the third quarter was $5.8 billion. That is up 5% from last quarter.  ESG revenue was up $276 million, or 9% sequentially, with all divisions and regions contributing to the positive results.  KBR revenue increased $10 million.  International revenue was 54% of the total for ESG, and 68% for Halliburton as a whole.  ESG operating income increased to $906 million, reflecting a 26.7% operating margin, the highest in our history.  KBR reported operating income of $98 million, with an operating margin of 4%, and that is after the $32 million, or $0.03 per share impairment charge.  Now, I will highlight ESG segment results.  Particularly noteworthy was the broad-based strength of our incremental margins across all four divisions and across each geographic region. Production optimization operating income increased $49 million, or 14%, with a 100 basis point improvement in margins.  Production enhancement had a favorable job mix and increased activity in U.S. land and recovery following the second quarter spring break-up in Canada.  Utilization of our stimulation vessels was strong worldwide.  Completion tools posted strong operating income results, particularly in the Middle East and Asia region, with strong sales for our recently acquired Easy Well product line. Operating income for completion tools also benefited from strong sequential improvements in Latin America, the North Sea, and Russia.  Fluid systems operating income was up $18 million, or 9%, due to strong U.S. land activity, recovery from second quarter spring break-up in Canada, and improved results in Africa and the Middle East.  Cementing services operating income increased sequentially, led by strength in drilling activity in North America. Cementing’s increased operating income was partially offset by higher mobilization and start-up costs for projects in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.  Baroid continued to increase its operating income margin, led by improved sales and pricing in Africa. Higher demand in the U.S. and the Canadian recovery also contributed to Baroid’s improvement.  Drilling information evaluation operating income increased to $227 million, compared to $189 million in the second quarter of 2006, while posting an operating income margin of 26.9%, a 250 basis point sequential improvement. Sperry contributed significantly to the division’s performance, posting sequential improvements in all regions. Sperry had particularly strong performance in the Middle East, with some contribution from the start-up of the Al Khurais project.  Security DBS’ operating income increased sequentially, benefiting from improved Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone bit sales in North America and Asia-Pacific.  Wireline’s operating income was down slightly, with improvements in several markets, offset by lower direct export sales during the quarter.  In the digital and consulting solution segment, operating income improved over 19% from the second quarter of 2006. Current indications are Landmark will continue with its traditionally strong fourth quarter results.  Let’s turn to the results for our two KBR segments.  In the Government and Infrastructure division, we posted operating income of $53 million, compared to $68 million in the second quarter. Iraq-related revenue decreased by $70 million from the second quarter due to decreased volumes. Our work for the U.S. Navy increased in the third quarter.  Our majority-owned U.K. maritime operations posted a strong quarter as well.  In the third quarter, we recorded a $32 million, non-cash impairment charge related to an Australian railroad joint venture, and that is due to slower-than-anticipated growth in freight revenue. The second quarter included a $17 million impairment charge related to our investment in a joint venture road project in the U.K.  The Energy and Chemicals segment posted operating income of $45 million, compared to the second quarter operating loss of $109 million. Third quarter operating income margin was a strong 7.5%.  Schedule delays and cost increases encountered on the Escravos gas and liquids project in Nigeria resulted in a second quarter operating income charge of $148 million, and Bill will provide an update on the Escravos project in a moment.  Let’s review some other financial items. In the third quarter, we had an effective tax rate of 33%. Our tax rate this quarter was favorably impacted by tax settlements. Our effective tax rate for 2007 should be approximately 35% to 36%, we think.  Capital expenditures totaled $238 million during the third quarter, or $619 million for the first nine months of the year. We expect capital expenditures for the full year 2006 to be approximately $875 million, and for 2007, we see our capital spending increasing to about $1.2 billion.  We were very aggressive in our stock repurchase program in the third quarter, buying back 26.6 million shares at a cost of $865 million. The repurchases during the third quarter added $0.01 to EPS, due to the change in average shares outstanding.  Now, let me turn it over to Andy Lane. 
Andrew R. Lane: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the ESG operational highlights from a regional perspective, let me make a quick comment about technology and capital.  Historically, about a third of our revenue has been driven by new product revenue. With our leadership in technology, coupled with our continued view of a strong market over the next several years, we are increasing our research and development budget by 20% to 30% in 2007.  Also, as Chris stated, we are also increasing our capital budget by 40% in 2007. We remain very positive about the outlook for the next several years, therefore we feel very confident about making these long-term investment commitments in technology and capital.  I am certainly proud of the overall ESG operating results this quarter -- the highest quarterly revenue and operating income in our history. The third quarter also continued the trend, with 11 straight ESG quarters of increasing revenue and seven quarters in a row of improving operating income.  I will begin with the Eastern Hemisphere, which showed revenue and operating income growth in both regions, including record results in revenue and operating income in the Middle East-Asia region, and record revenue in the Europe-Africa CIS region.  Our Europe-Africa CIS region showed a $34 million, or a 5% increase in revenue from last quarter. Results in Africa were driven by Baroid’s strong performance in West Africa and Algeria, where we experienced both price increases and higher product sales.  Our stimulation vessels in Angola showed increased utilization this quarter, and frac and acid work in West Africa was in high demand.  We booked our first wireline revenue in Libya in the third quarter. We recently deployed additional assets to support our continued growth plans for Libya.  Africa should have a strong fourth quarter, driven by increased sales of completion tools, increased demand for directional drilling services, and higher activity in Algeria.  Our Middle East-Asia region revenue grew $10 million compared to last quarter. This was despite a $15 million sequential decrease in wireline direct sales into Asia. Offsetting the lower direct sales, we saw increased demand for our directional drilling and wireline services in Asia-Pacific.  Our results in Saudi Arabia continue to strengthen. In our Sperry business, we saw a significant increase in revenue from the second quarter, related to higher demand for our Geo-Pilot and GeoTap systems, and the start-up on work on the Khurais project for Saudi Aramco. We currently are servicing two drilling rigs for the Khurais project, with an expectation for an additional nine rigs running by the end of this year, and more rigs to be added in the early part of 2007. The project will have in excess of 20 rigs at peak activity levels. Now, turning to the Western Hemisphere. We had a very strong quarter in the U.S. -- in fact, our best quarter ever. Demand for our services was strong throughout the quarter, and we continued to realize pricing gains. Our margins in the Western Hemisphere were the highest in our history.  Looking ahead, we have seen limited examples of softening in the U.S. market, due to the weakness in the price of natural gas. So far, this has not impacted our activity. Our scheduling boards are full and we are as busy as we have ever been. We are also preparing for the typical fourth quarter seasonal reduction in activity we see in places like Utah and Wyoming, due to winter stipulations imposed by the Bureau of Land Management, and other areas in which we work that are impacted by weather and the holiday season.  We do believe that the softness in natural gas pricing could, in the next three to six months, impact our ability to push through pricing increases as aggressively as we have in the past. If this turns out to be the case, we expect the impact to be short-lived.  Our Canadian operations rebounded from the impact of the second quarter spring break-up, with the average rig count for the third quarter increasing to 494 rigs from 282 in the second quarter. Our revenue in Canada increased by 69% from the second quarter. However, late in the third quarter, we began to see a slowdown in shallow wells and coalbed methane drilling activities, as the natural gas spot price declined.  We expect to see Canada’s typical busiest season, which lasts from November through March, to kick off shortly.  Revenue in Latin America increased 10% from the second quarter. All divisions contributed to the strong results in Latin America. In Mexico, we experienced increased demand for our oil stimulation and drilling fluid services.  Venezuela results were also strong, with revenue gains posted by production enhancement, completion tools, Baroid, wireline, and drilling services.  Now, I will turn the call over to Bill Utt to address KBR. Bill. 
William P. Utt: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. I am certainly pleased about KBR’s overall results for the third quarter, particularly in light of the very difficult second quarter we experienced. We have recently received our six-month [Iraq award peace scores]. Again, we were awarded an excellent rating of 96, reflecting our customers continuing satisfaction with the work we perform, serving the troops in a very difficult environment.  We also received an excellent rating for our work for the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. My congratulations to all the KBR employees working on the LOGCAP-3 project for a job well done.  As you know, we have been forecasting a drop in revenue related to our Iraq work, but so far, it has not materialized. We have not seen changes in our workload that would be related to a reduction in troop count, so the demand for our services has remained strong.  In fact, in August of this year, we were awarded a large task order under our LOGCAP-3 contract for additional work through 2007. But as we have mentioned before, the U.S. Army has announced its plans to transition from the LOGCAP-3 contract to a new LOGCAP-4 contract. The LOGCAP-4 contract will be divided among three contractors, so our work will likely decrease from current levels.  We have recently submitted our bid on the LOGCAP-4 proposal to the customer and we understand the work will be awarded sometime during the fourth quarter.  The $53 million in operating income posted in the third quarter by KBR’s government and infrastructure division is particularly noteworthy in light of the $32 million impairment charge we reported related to our investment in the Australian railroad.  Remember, this is not a construction project, but rather an ownership interest we have in the railroad, similar to the interest we sold last year in the Dulles toll road. We continue to be disappointed with this venture, as it has struggled to meet freight volume growth forecasts. We do, however, remain committed to the investment. We have been working with the project’s bankers to restructure the joint venture’s debt to delay principal payments. Currently, $10 million remains on our books related to this investment.  Our Energy and Chemical segment posted a very good quarter. Operating income margins of 7.5% resulted from strong project execution worldwide. Our efforts related to project selection and execution is reflected in these results, and I would like to acknowledge the hard work of our energy and chemical employees in this regard. We continue to be very focused on risk management in selecting and pricing the projects we pursue. At current energy price levels, we continue to see a strong demand for our services, particularly in the gas monetization arena.  Now, a quick update on the Escravos project. Our discussions with our customers to reduce our risk in the project have been successful. We have recently executed change orders for amounts in excess of $200 million. With these change orders, portions of the remaining work now have a lower risk profile, particularly with respect to security and logistics. We feel the contingency recorded on the contract remains adequate. We are back to work on the project, and are currently approximately 38% complete.  Also, as KBR proceeds to life outside of Halliburton, I am continuing to refine the management structure of the KBR organization in preparation for becoming a publicly traded company. I began this process in the third quarter and expect to be complete by the end of the year. I expect these changes will continue KBR’s progress towards best-in-class risk awareness and risk management.  Finally, I am looking forward to leading KBR through the separation process and I am confident the standalone KBR will be a leader in the markets we compete in. All of the KBR employees are excited about the prospect of being part of a standalone company.  Let me now turn the call back to Dave for some closing comments. Dave.
David J. Lesar: Thanks, Bill. As you can see, we have a lot ahead of us. KBR’s separation is just around the corner. In the Energy Services Group, our Eastern Hemisphere business continues to grow as we invest in key resources in important markets. We are focused on offering the most advanced technology solutions to our customers, as well applications continue to become more and more complex. As Andy said, we are committed to increasing our technology spend significantly as we go forward to make all of this happen.  We are also confident that any softness in the North America market will be temporary, as natural gas supply and demand equilibrium will correct itself.  Now, let’s open it up for questions. Please limit your comments to one question and one follow-up. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Daniel Henriques of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. 
Daniel Henriques - Goldman Sachs: Good morning. My question is on KBR, just one clarification. Let’s assume a scenario without the IPO. Is there any reason why the spin-off could not happen even earlier in ’07 than compared to your April ’07 deadline? When were you expecting the IRS approval?
C. Christopher Gaut: Yes, Daniel, it could happen well before April, in the event of there not being an initial public offering first. 
Daniel Henriques - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and in terms of the IPO, I am not sure if you mentioned the timing. Is that December, November?
C. Christopher Gaut: We are working through the registration process with the SEC and that is hard to predict. We had said here today that we would like to do an IPO, but it would have to be this year. If we cannot get it done this year, then we are going to move on to a straight spin. 
Operator: Our next question is from Jim Wicklund of Banc of America. Your question, please.
Jim Wicklund - Banc of America Securities: Clarification on cap-ex. Chris, didn’t you all say it was going to be $2 billion next year, up from eight and change this year? Did I hear that right?
C. Christopher Gaut: No, $1.2 billion. 
Jim Wicklund - Banc of America Securities: $1.2 billion?
C. Christopher Gaut: About a 40% increase. 
Jim Wicklund - Banc of America Securities: Boy, I hate to waste my question on that. My related follow-up is in terms of cap-ex, the margins and returns that you are getting on domestic pressure pumping business, and everybody else is getting, has attracted a great deal of capacity additions. Where do you think returns on pressure pumping or margins on pressure pumping, how high do you think they can ultimately go?
C. Christopher Gaut: Jim, they are very attractive now, as you point out. We do not see deterioration there. But as we look forward to where we will be spending more of our money in 2007, most of the increase is going into our drilling information evaluation segment for additional tools for Sperry and for wireline. Our fluids business is going to have a nice increase in 2007 as well, so we see many good opportunities out there. We are not constrained by good investment opportunities, whether it is in well stimulation, directional drilling, logging well drilling, wireline or drilling fluids and cementing. 
David J. Lesar: Jim, we are also putting more of our pressure pumping investment into the Eastern Hemisphere in 2007, where we do see some more uplift in margins from pressure pumping in that hemisphere. 
Operator: Our next question is from James Stone of UBS. Your question, please. 
James H. Stone - UBS: I just want to, Andy, talk a little bit about -- if we could revisit the comments that you made in July on pricing and what you thought it would be like to implement pricing in the second-half of the year, and see if you can update us on what you experienced in the third quarter and then how you see going forward, both on the domestic side as well as on the international side. 
Andrew R. Lane: Yes, Jamie, and we did talk about it in the second quarter, and what we were referring to is the slowing in the increase of price increases. We did see, however, and were very encouraged in August and September on pricing in the improvement we did receive in the quarter. The prices did improve, both in the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere.  As you know, the majority of our current work in the U.S. is on contract on some form of annual type contract, and so roughly 70%, 80% of that work, we will negotiate prices for 2007 here in November-December, and we are encouraged by the outlook that we will have at that point, and we are still optimistic we are going to push prices through in the November-December timeframe for the majority of our U.S. North America work. 
James H. Stone - UBS: Okay, and then just a related follow-up on the DFE side, that business was very strong in the quarter. You are obviously committing more capital to it. Is the growth going forward there, could you give us a sense of how much you think is volume versus price?
Andrew R. Lane: As you know, we have been constrained in Sperry, and we are catching up with our manufacturing deliveries. We also see a lot of opportunity for growth, so we are putting, as Chris said, even more of our capital investment into Sperry. So it is mostly volume-driven, and it is a very competitive segment of the market, but we see still good growth in top-line and good margin improvement as we deploy in the Eastern Hemisphere.  One prime example is the Al Khurais that we talked about. We are only on two rigs there. As you know, that is a 100% Halliburton project, and so we are going to be ramping up to over 20 rigs, so we are optimistic there that Sperry will do very well in Saudi.  We are still seeing a lot of rollout of our technology, of wide acceptance of Geo-Pilot and GeoTap, and we are working on several more technology rollouts that will happen in 2007. 
Operator: Our next question is from Geoff Kieburtz of Citigroup. Your question, please. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: Good morning. I guess I was a little bit surprised at a 40% increase in the cap-ex. Could you go into a little bit more detail as to maybe -- I understand more going into DFE, but could you give us some calibration here, how much is going into each major segment compared to what your ’06 cap-ex allocation was?
C. Christopher Gaut: Sure, Geoff. The biggest increase is in drilling information and evaluation, as I mentioned, and that will be a substantial increase. A lot of it having to do with some of the contract wins that we have, as well as just for general expansion as we see in our Eastern Hemisphere business.  The next largest increase will be in the fluid segments, building out cementing skids for the new rigs, new offshore rigs going into service, and the expansion of our business there. But also, in drilling fluids, as we build out bulk plants in additional areas to serve the increased markets we see in West Africa, North Africa, Asia, for instance, and Latin America.  Then, the third would be production optimization, in terms of increase. That is completions facilities, manufacturing capacity, as well as the continuing build-out of our fleet and replacement of our fleet and importantly, the build-out of our fleet for Eastern Hemisphere applications in places like Russia, Middle East.  Hopefully that will give you a picture there, Geoff, if that is sufficient. 
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: Would you offer maybe a split on your pressure pumping investment? What amount is outside of North America?
C. Christopher Gaut: Well, North America is, of course, a very large production enhancement market, but our deliveries in North America next year, we are actually going to be down from 2006 a bit, but up outside of North America. 
Operator: Our next question is from Jim Crandell of Lehman Brothers. Your question, please. 
James D. Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. Very good quarter. My question, Andy or Dave, relates to Sperry and the technology development. Your main competitor has introduced a family of tools in the last couple of years which seem to go beyond what anything else has done. Where are you in coming up with a family of tools which can really look out from the formation and compete on an equal footing, let’s say, with what this built family offers?
Andrew R. Lane: Jim, we are continuing to expand in a couple of areas. First, in the breadth of our Geo-Pilot and GeoTap line of equipment, we are the only ones with a slim hole, full offering on rotary steerable, plus the GeoTap, so we see a large demand for that and we are going to continue to invest in that technology and deployment of that.  We also see several developments coming out in early 2007. Our mid-end rotary steerable technology that we have been working on for six to 12 months, we will see that being commercialized in mid-2007, and we are very optimistic about that market share.  We are also working -- Tim Probert has several new developments coming out on the Sperry side for additional technology that will roll out in 2007 and 2008, so we feel we will be in a very strong position next year in technology comparisons. 
James D. Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Okay, and my related follow-up is, where are we in terms of the new offshore rigs that have been ordered in ordering cementing skids? How well do you think you are doing overall in terms of market share thus far in placing skids on the new offshore rigs that are being constructed?
Andrew R. Lane: We track that very closely, Jim, and we are doing excellent this year. I think we are outpacing three-to-one our competitors in placement of cement skids. We track that as a net number across both refurbs and new builds, so we are very pleased with the progress there and that is part of our capital spend, as Chris said, in cementing units, and cement skids is a big part of that. 
Operator: Our next question is from Dan Pickering of Pickering Energy Partners. Your question, please. 
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: Good morning. On KBR, there seems to me there are a lot of moving pieces, obviously. If we added back the Australian charge, you did about $130 million in operating income in the third quarter. Is that the right general area for us to think about fourth quarter and sort of a 2007 run-rate? 
Andrew R. Lane: That was an exceptional quarter for KBR and we would not guide KBR as that on a consistent basis. That is I think something that they can aim for, but in terms of guidance on an ongoing basis, I think that is when everything goes exactly right. 
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: My other question would be, could you talk to us a little bit, refresh us on your acquisition strategy, where you guys are looking, and give us an update on whether or not the changing commodity price environment for both gas and oil, has that helped, hurt, or no change to your opportunity base?
C. Christopher Gaut: We are pursuing a number of potential deals, as Dave mentioned. We are not going to talk about the specifics there. Clearly the valuations of public companies have come down, but it is also true that a seller’s price expectations do not necessarily come down as fast as the public market pricing.  That is taking a bit -- it is a little bit harder to work through that, but we think we will get there on some deals that we are working on now that we think will be important and additive to our results.  In the meantime, we feel that our opportunistic approach to our stock repurchase is the right approach. You saw that we were aggressive in the third quarter. Of course, we are out of the market for buying back stock by the company. It is the same basis we are for insiders until we were out of the market since the end of September, until we announced earnings here, but we see that as a good opportunistic value and will be continuing to pursue that. 
Operator: Our next question is from Ken Sill of Credit Suisse. Your question, please. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse First Boston: Good morning. I do not think the horse is dead yet, so I am going to beat it one more time, on pressure pumping cap-ex. Could you give us a feel of how much -- obviously you guys have inflation, so in the 40% increase in cap-ex, what do you think that is going to translate into in terms of an increase in actual capacity? Will it be as much, or half of that? Do you have any idea on that?
Andrew R. Lane: We will be adding equipment and adding capacity next year, but not as much as in 2006. For competitive reasons, we are not going to quantify that, Ken. As we mentioned before, the economics of reinvesting in that business are outstanding, but we have a good jump on that, maybe ahead of some others.  Now, with the improvement in so many other markets around the world, we are seeing very good investment opportunities in these other areas, and that is why we are putting so much capital there as well. We like the North America well stimulation business. We are continuing to invest in it, but we are also looking to become bigger in so many other areas, and so it is a broader-based program for 2007 than we have ever had before. 
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse First Boston: Okay, and then as a follow-up, one of the big debates is, is there any real differentiation in a lot of the new [capacities] coming on, or is the market in North America differentiate-able? As a corollary there, do you guys have an estimate what the average life of some of this pressure pumping equipment would be, given how hard you are running it these days?
Andrew R. Lane: I definitely think the U.S. market is differentiated on technology. We feel very strongly that we lead in the high tech, deep high pressure frac applications. The only area that is really a commodity type market would be the water type fracs and some of the shales. Even within the shales, of that being produced, the unconventional gas there, we see a lot of technology being applied recently in horizontal wells with pinpoint simulations. That is clearly a differentiating technology that Halliburton is applying, with some record results on those wells.  There is definitely a different scale on pressure pumping and the technology being applied in the U.S. 
Operator: Our next question is from Scott Gill of Simmons & Company International. Your question, please.
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company International: Yes, good morning. Bill, I was wondering if you could answer for me, if you look at the Escravos project and what has occurred there, if you couldn’t just contrast the Escravos GTL project with the Pearl GTL project in terms of contract terms and maybe what those risks are on the Pearl project as we look forward?
William P. Utt: Certainly, Scott. The Pearl project is fundamentally a reimbursable project for us. As such, we are performing services at the direction of the client group, and they instruct us what to do, we place packages, so fundamentally, the risk return aspect of that is a much lower risk profile than we see on a fixed price EPC project such as Escravos.  We spent a lot of time in the last six months since my arrival focusing on risk awareness, and I think we are doing a much better job of really identifying the risks and asking very thoughtfully, how do you best allocate those risks within the contracts, and also, how do you price the risks that we retain within KBR? Fundamentally, the difference between Escravos is a lump sum turnkey project where we are putting our balance sheet behind the contract for a fixed price, in contrast to Pearl, which is a reimbursable project. 
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company International: My follow-up then, Bill, is as you look forward on the ENC side at KBR, what does that opportunity set look like as you do go into 2007 in terms of major projects?
William P. Utt: The market remains strong for the products and services that KBR provides, particularly around the gas monetization arena. I think we continue to be able to look at a lot of projects, and we see a great, good market to be a participant in for 2007, and through the end of the year.  We are seeing, from our standpoint, the chance to shape projects very thoughtfully with our customers and have much more intimate dialogs with them regarding what risks the contractor should bear, and certainly the pricing for those risks, and what risks are most appropriately born by the customer.  I think we are excited about the market as we see it continue to unfold for us for 2007, and we think we will be able, through our dialog with our clients, to be able to have a richer series of discussions that I think will result in a higher value added by KBR in the client capital expenditure programs that we participate in. 
Operator: Our next question is from Roger Read of Natexis Bleichroeder. Your question, please. 
Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder Inc.: Good morning. I guess my main question is, you look at the possibility of a slowdown in the U.S. regarding the pressure pumping. You mentioned mobilization would go up and utilization I guess would go down. Could you give us an idea of what utilization has been running at this point, and what you have seen in a prior -- let’s call it plateau or slowdown -- in terms of the impact on utilization?
Andrew R. Lane: Yes, Roger. We are basically 100% utilized right now. Third quarter, as we said, was a peak in activity for us, and we were fully utilized across the board.  We do not see any -- and we have a very good outlook for the next 60 days, of course, and we see very strong workload through the full fourth quarter, so we have very little concern at all in the slowdown there in work in the short-term.  Longer term, we still see our position in the market is very strong, and we know from living through many down cycles and slow downs, that we usually maximize our market share in the slower periods as the smaller players fall out, and we certainly think that would happen again, if there was any slow down this time.  We are still seeing full utilization and we plan to continue that. 
David J. Lesar: The mobilizations are within North America, from one base to another, and that’s what this equipment is made to do. We are not talking about huge disruptions. 
Andrew R. Lane: It is very common for us to move people and equipment between the Rockies, MidCon, South Texas, and then we are just going to optimize the location where the most work is. 
Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder Inc.: Okay, so it is fair to say that mobilizations are not anything new, and like you say, it is not something we would necessarily see as long as it is within fairly contiguous regions within the United States?
Andrew R. Lane: Yes, you will not see it. The mobilizations that take longer and higher cost are the mobilizations to Algeria, the ramp-up on Khurais, some work in Amman, those are the types of mobilizations -- mobilizations to Libya and Russia. They take a little longer and are a little more expensive, but you are not going to see it in the U.S., and we do not plan to see much of a downturn as we -- 
David J. Lesar: We are not talking about -- when we talk about mobilizations within our oil stimulation business in North America, we are not talking about moving equipment out of North America. 
Operator: Our next question is from Michael Urban of Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. 
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: Thanks, good morning. It seems like the focus in the market has been on gross capacity additions in the pumping business. I was wondering if you had a sense or you could offer a sense for what the attrition rate is, either in the industry or specific to Halliburton? Then, if that might change, if indeed you did see a slowdown, would you just start taking more equipment out of the market?
Andrew R. Lane: Yes, Mike, you hit it there at the end. That is exactly what we do. Of course, 2005, 2006 had been so robust that we have not taken a lot of older equipment out of the market, and if there was any slowdown activity, that would certainly be one of the things we look at doing.  But we have done a lot of investment over the last couple of years, so the age of our fleet is in very good shape, but there always are a few pieces of equipment that are much older that we would take out. 
Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank: Any sense of that attrition rate, either industry-wide or specific to you guys?
Andrew R. Lane: There’s just not a lot right now. 
David J. Lesar: No, there is not a lot right now. We have time for one more question, Evelyn?
Evelyn Angelle: Yes. 
Operator: Our next question is from Robert Mackenzie of FBR. Your question, please. 
Robert Mackenzie - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: Good morning. I wanted to dig a little deeper into your viewpoint that Halliburton would hold up better in market share if there is a downturn. I wanted to get how you would respond to pricing moves. For example, if one of your smaller competitors decided to cut price to maintain share, and also if one of your larger competitors tried the same?
David J. Lesar: We do not compete in a lot of markets heads-up with the smaller competitors, so their pricing tactics are not of primary importance to us. Of the three large competitors, we are very competitively priced, and we do not see any, as we said in the third quarter, we did not see any impact on pricing. We actually had positive movement on pricing during the quarter, so we still feel very strong about our position there. 
Robert Mackenzie - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.: My follow-up is in prior downturns, you have often seen one or more of the big names lead the way in taking prices down to maintain share. What is your viewpoint on either Halliburton doing that or one of your competitors doing that this time?
Andrew R. Lane: Halliburton will not do that, and we still see this very much as a demand-driven market, and we do not see that happening, so we are not foreseeing that cycle happening anytime in the near future. 
David J. Lesar: One last question. 
Operator: Our final question is from Robin Shoemaker of Bear Stearns. Your question, please. 
Robin Shoemaker - Bear, Stearns & Co.: Yes, thank you. I wanted to just go back to the cap-ex budget for a minute. I think you told us in Houston that $1 of cap-ex, you expect to generate $4 of revenue. I wonder if that would still be the case as you shift cap-ex a little bit away from pressure pumping equipment? The timeframe for cash on cash return on capital spending, what is your basic guideline or principle there?
Andrew R. Lane: In the past couple of years, we have had that kind of revenue increment associated with the capital spending that we have had. We are not counting on that kind of increment necessarily continuing right away, from this additional cap-ex. As we build up cap-ex, the growth would be attractive but maybe not at that remarkable rate.  Robin, the economics that we look for are a 15% after-tax, un-leveraged internal rate of return, and in this market, with these opportunities, we feel that we are clearly exceeding that with the discretionary spending that we are doing here.  As I said earlier, we have more opportunities, good opportunities, then we are going to take advantage of here in this market. We will ration them out and this is where we have come out, as I described earlier. 
Robin Shoemaker - Bear, Stearns & Co.: Right, and in terms of the split of cap-ex next year, this $1.2 billion, I believe you have indicated that 60% of this year’s cap-ex is North America. Is it shifting more to international in ’07?
Andrew R. Lane: Very much so, very much so. 
Robin Shoemaker - Bear, Stearns & Co.: You do not have a percentage breakdown for us on that? 
Andrew R. Lane: Certainly a significant more of the majority is going to be outside North America next year, so most of the growth is outside North America, and that is a lot of growth, as you have seen. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn it back over to management for any closing remarks. 
Evelyn Angelle: Thank you, everyone. That concludes our call. If anyone has further questions, please feel free to call us sometime today. Thank you. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Good day and welcome to today's Halliburton Company second quarter 2006 earnings results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Evelyn Angelle. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Evelyn Angelle: Thanks, Allison. Good morning and welcome to Halliburton's second quarter 2006 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being webcast, and a replay will be available on our website for seven days. A podcast download will also be available on our website within 24 hours after the call. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, our CEO; Chris Gaut, our CFO; Andy Lane, our COO; and Bill Utt, the President and CEO of KBR. The press release announcing our second quarter results is available on our website. The financial information in the press release has been restated to reflect our recent two-for-one stock split, as well as the reorganization of our tubing conveyed perforating, slick line, and under-balanced applications operations from Production Optimization into the Drilling and Formation Evaluation division. In today's call Dave will provide opening remarks; Chris will discuss our overall operating performance and financial position; followed by Andy, who will review the ESG regions and our business outlook. Bill will address KBR operations. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. Before turning the call over to Dave, I would like to remind our audience that some of today's conference may include forward-looking statements, reflecting the Company's view about future events and their potential impact on our performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company's operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Now I will turn the call over to Dave Lesar.
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Evelyn and good morning everyone. I would like to begin today by reminding you of the ESG performance objectives that we shared with you at our recent Analyst and Investor Day.  We said we believe we can post revenue growth in excess of 20% annually, while at the same time achieving industry-leading operating margins. Already in the first half of 2006 we have increased our revenue over the same period in 2005 by 30%. Our operating margins have increased from 22.2% in the first half of 2005 to 25.1% in the first half of 2006. Our goal is to achieving industry-leading returns on equity. Halliburton's consolidated return on equity in the first half of 2006 on an annualized basis was 27%. If you exclude KBR, this figure increases by approximately 5 percentage points. We also stated that we expect the Energy Services Group operating income to double within three years, and net income and EPS to double as well within that period. The momentum we have seen at ESG is continuing, and our strong second quarter results reflect that.  Even with a $100 million decline in Canadian revenue compared to the first quarter, due to the seasonal slowdown from break-up, I'm happy to report that the ESG posted record revenues in the second quarter. It was the first time ever that our Energy Group generated quarterly revenue of over $3 billion, with sequential growth of $178 million in revenues, or 6%, even with the impact of the $100 million Canadian break-up. Production Optimization, Fluid Systems, and Drilling Formation Evaluation all contributed record revenue. Within these three divisions all product service lines had record revenue, with the exception of Security, which was just shy of last quarter's record revenue. Our the ESG also achieved record operating margins of over 25% in the second quarter, with record operating income of $791 million. All of our Production Optimization, Fluid Systems and DFE segments generated record operating income. Sequentially, ESG incremental margins were a strong 36% despite the Canadian impact.  Our North American region revenue grew by over 28% from the first quarter. The strength of our U.S. market was shown by double digit sequential increases in revenue from the first and second quarter, with continued increases in operating margins. Now as to the U.S., we see no slowdown in the U.S. market at this time. In fact, we are experiencing increasing demand for all of our services, even with national gas prices at current levels. Therefore, we implemented price book increases over the past few months of up to 12% across our product service lines. We are benefiting from high customer activity, our price increases, and more effective utilization of our equipment. With the Canadian break-up now behind us, the second half of the year should show even stronger results in North America. We also communicated to you our commitment to grow in the Eastern Hemisphere. I would like to share a few highlights from there:  We saw good sequential growth for the Eastern Hemisphere in the second quarter compared to the first, 14% revenue growth and 31% sequential growth in operating income. This quarter for the first time in our history the Eastern Hemisphere operating margins were above 20%. Big contributors to this growth were Euroasia, the North Sea, North Africa, Australia, and Malaysia. Both our regions in the Eastern Hemisphere generated record revenue, with our Middle East and Asia regions also posting record operating income. We were also successful this quarter in winning major new contracts in the Eastern Hemisphere. For example, we were awarded the Al Khurais mega project in Saudi Arabia, which is a three-year contract to support drilling and completion of more than 300 wells. This project is a significant addition to our already strong Saudi operations and this contract alone will increase our revenue there by approximately 30% over the three-year term of the contract. We've also been recently awarded two contracts in Norway. The first is a $193 million fluids contract by Statoil, in which we will be providing cementing, drilling fluids and completion fluids in the North Sea for two years, with additional extension options for three two-year periods. This contract was among the largest cementing and completion fluids contract awarded in 2006 on a worldwide basis.  The second project is $150 million contract to provide integrated drilling and well services to Drilling Production Technology. Halliburton's project management team will manage and integrate the service offerings, which include a real-time center. I'm also pleased with the sequential performance of Landmark, which posted an 18% increase in revenue, with an operating margin improvement of over 500 basis points in the last quarter. This is a good indicator of what to expect from Landmark in the second half of the year as Landmark's revenues are typically at their strongest later in the year. Now let me talk for a moment about KBR. One disappointment for us this quarter was the Escravos project. We recorded a $0.04 per diluted share after-tax charge in the second quarter related to this first ever gas-to-liquids project in Nigeria. This is a gas-to-liquids, not an LNG plant. The issues that we had related to local community concerns, impeded site access and conditions, as well as some of the knock-on effects of these and other project scope changes on equipment and future construction costs.  Under the accounting rules, we are required to look out until the end of the contract and make our best estimate of the total project loss through completion. Most of this charge reflected in our second quarter results estimated future losses on the project during the construction phase, rather than actual losses incurred on work performed to-date. We're discussing with our customer contractual changes to amend and de-risk this contract. Now let me update you on our plans for KBR. We remain committed to a full and complete separation of KBR from Halliburton. However, as I'm am sure you know and had been widely reported, the IPO market right now is showing some pressure, resulting in many offerings being postponed or withdrawn.  That, along with our ongoing discussions with Chevron about amending and de-risking the Escravos project, could potentially impact the timing of an IPO of KBR. Although we continue to see an IPO as attractive, we do not want to delay the ultimate timing of the final separation of KBR.  Therefore, in order to affect the complete separation of KBR from Halliburton as quickly as possible, we are now pursuing a tax free spin-off of KBR to Halliburton's shareholders. If we see market conditions as favorable, we would proceed with a spin-off, but perhaps do an IPO first; but the IPO is not a necessary first step any longer. We intend to seek a ruling from the IRS regarding the tax-free status of the transaction before we do the spin-off, a process that could be completed within approximately six to nine months.  We continue to believe the separation through the public market is the best path forward, as it will allow senior management of each business to focus on strategic plans that can more fully develop the potential for each of these businesses. The result of this spin-off will be two pure play companies: Halliburton, which will be totally focused on energy services; and KBR, a global engineering, construction and service company. Now let me turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Gaut: I will discuss our second quarter results compared sequentially to the first quarter. Halliburton Company revenue in the second quarter was $5.5 billion. That is up 7% from last quarter.  Energy Services Group, ESG revenue, was up $178 million or 6% sequentially, led by strong gains in the U.S., the former Soviet Union and the North Sea. Our second quarter Canadian operations were, of course, affected by the significant reduction in rig activity during the spring break-up season, which is now behind us. KBR revenue increased $183 million or 8% sequentially, primarily due to increased activity in Iraq under our LogCAP 3 contract.  International revenue was 54% of the total for ESG, and 68% for Halliburton as a whole. Halliburton achieved operating income of $718 million in the second quarter. Overall, ESG's operating income increased to $791 million, reflecting a 25% operating margin. KBR reported an operating loss of $41 million in the second quarter, due to the Nigerian gas-to-liquids project that Dave mentioned. Now let me highlight the ESG segment results: Production Optimization revenue increased $96 million or 8% compared to the first quarter, and that was despite spring break-up in Canada. Continued strength in demand for our stimulation services in the U.S. land and Completion Tools activity for U.S. land and in the Gulf of Mexico helped drive this growth. Vessel utilization increased in the Gulf of Mexico and strengthened internationally as well. As you recall from last year, some of our stimulation vessels had low utilization due to maintenance downtime and mobilizations. In the second quarter we saw the benefits of putting these stimulation vessels back to work. We expect a similar level of vessel utilization throughout the balance of the year. We also initiated several projects in the second quarter in Norway, which boosted revenue for Production Enhancement. Russia, where well stimulation is our leading service, showed strong revenue gains following a slow first quarter due to extreme winter weather conditions. Angola and Malaysia were highlights for both Production Enhancement and Completion Tools, with increasing demand driving gains in those markets. Production Optimization operating income increased $33 million or 10%, with a 63 basis point improvement in margins. Increasing demand for well stimulation services in the U.S., particularly multi-stage fracturing and long horizontal wells contributed to profitability. In the Eastern Hemisphere, Production Enhancement operating income benefited from higher activity in Norway, equipment utilization gains in Australia, and better utilization of the vessels in west Africa. Completion Tools experienced increased demand in Africa, especially Angola and throughout the Middle East and Asia region. In the Fluids Systems segment revenue increased sequentially by $34 million or 4%, overcoming the impact of Canadian break-up. The Europe Africa CIS region led the growth with both Cementing and Baroid showing strong gains in Russia. Cementing also benefited from increased drilling activity in Norway.  Baroid, our Drilling Fluids division, showed strength in Egypt and Kazakhstan. The Middle East Asia region also posted revenue increases in both Cementing and Baroid. In the Western Hemisphere, both Cementing and Baroid posted strong revenue increases in the U.S. and in Latin America. Fluid Systems operating income was up $11 million or 6% due to strong U.S. land drilling and improved results in Europe, Russia, Australasian and Latin America. Cementing Services operating income increased sequentially, led by excellent results in Norway and Russia, offsetting the negative impacts of Canada.  Baroid's operating income margin improvement continued, positively affected by insurance recoveries related to last year's hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as improved performance in Mexico and in the Middle East. Our Drilling Information Evaluation segment had a revenue increase of $49 million or 7% sequentially. Growth was strongest in Eastern Hemisphere.  Sperry had record revenue in the second quarter, and that is despite the impact of Canadian break-up, led by increased activity in the North Sea, Euroasia, Nigeria and Australia. Logging also posted record second quarter revenue and double-digit sequential revenue growth due to strong activity in all operating areas. Security DBS Drill Bits revenue decreased slightly due to seasonality in Canada, but the fixed cutter drill plant expansion project is now complete, and Security DBS posted record fixed cutter bit production in June. Drilling Information Evaluation operating income increased to $189 million compared to $172 million in the first quarter of 2006. Logging contributed significantly to the division's performance, posting a 500 basis point sequential improvement in operating margin. Sperry's operating income was up in all regions, except for North America, which was impacted by Canada. Security DBS was also impacted significantly by Canadian seasonality and showed decreased operating income. In the Digital and Consulting Solutions segment, sequential revenue was flat and operating income was up 6% over the first quarter. Landmark revenue was up 18% and operating income up 48%. This reflects incremental margins of 55%. All regions showed sequential improvement with strength from services and software sales. Looking ahead, we expect Landmark to benefit from higher customer spending in the second half of 2006. In Project Management we experienced revenue declines, as we are nearing completion of the turnkey drilling project in Mexico. We continue to see improved margins globally in project management. Now let's turn to results for our two KBR segments. Government and Infrastructure revenue for the second quarter was $1.9 billion compared to $1.7 billion in Q1. The majority of the increase resulted from higher activity in Iraq, some of which related to procurement of equipment such as armored trucks for our customer.  Revenue was also positively impacted in the UK by the start-up of our work under the Allenby and Connaught project and higher activity in our DML shipyard. This was partially offset by the winding down of our hurricane response work under competitively bid contracts for the Department of Defense along the U.S. Gulf Coast. Operating income for the second quarter 2006 for G&I was $68 million compared to $20 million in the first quarter, an increase of $48 million. The increase was driven by higher revenue in Iraq. Second quarter included a $17 million impairment charge related to our investment in the joint venture road project in the UK. Revenue in our Energy and Chemicals segment was relatively flat compared to last quarter, and was positively impacted by the recently awarded EBIC ammonia plant project in Egypt. The Energy and Chemicals segment posted an operating loss of $109 million compared to operating income of $42 million in the first quarter this year. Schedule delays and cost increases encountered on the Escravos gas-to-liquids project in Nigeria resulted in a charge of $148 million against operating income.  Keep in mind that KBR consolidates the Escravos projects in its operating results. To get to our equity participation we back out Getty's 50% participation as a minority interest, which is reflected below operating income on an after-tax basis. So while our operating income reflects 100% of the project charge, our net income reflects only our 50% portion of the impact. Under GAAP when a project moves to a loss we must recognize currently all the loss through the completion of the project, and that is what we have done with Escravos project this quarter. We reversed the profit previously recorded on a percentage complete basis, and booked the anticipated loss, plus increased contingency, through the end of the project. Now let's review some other financial items. Foreign currency line item on our income statement decreased $18 million from last quarter to a $10 million net loss in Q2. This was a technical accounting impact as the U.S. dollar proceeds from the sale of Production Services were received by our KBR UK subsidiary, and that UK subsidiary has British sterling as its functional currency. Of course, there was no economic impact to us despite the accounting. This quarter we had an effective tax rate of 32%. Our tax rate this quarter was favorably impacted by tax settlements. Our effective tax rate should average around 35% during the balance of the year. Capital expenditures totaled $221 million during the second quarter, or $381 million for the first half of this year. We expect capital expenditures to continue to increase the rest of this year, with full year 2006 CapEx of approximately $850 million, and approximately $1 billion to $1.2 billion for 2007. Since we began our stock repurchase program in March of this year, we have repurchased a little over 5 million shares at an average price of $35.55 per share. That includes 3.8 million shares purchased during the second quarter at an average price of $35.94 per share. We have been out of the market during the last month in preparation for our second quarter earnings announcement.
Andy Lane: Good morning everyone. This morning I will be discussing ESG operational highlights from a regional perspective. As Dave mentioned, we had a good overall performance led this quarter by the Eastern Hemisphere on a revenue increase of $146 million sequentially, with sequential incremental margins of 42%.  Our Europe/Africa CIS region showed a $79 million or 13% increase in revenue from last quarter. The North Sea rebounded well from the seasonal decline we saw in the first quarter, with Cementing and Production Enhancement each contributing to the increase. The strike in Norway had only a minimal impact on our results in the second quarter. The impact on third quarter results will be dependant on the duration of the strike, but will negatively impact revenue by an estimated $7 million in July. After an extremely cold first quarter which impacted our overall Russian operations, we achieved good revenue growth from well stimulations, cementing, and drilling fluids in the second quarter. Second quarter results for Angola were significantly improved, driven by higher utilization of our stimulation vessels and stronger sales of completion products. Our work in Nigeria is being impacted by the unrest in the Niger Delta. We estimate these disruptions to be impacting ESG revenue by approximately $3 million to $4 million per quarter. The bigger impact from the Nigerian unrest is in our Energy and Chemicals division of KBR, and Bill will discuss these issues next. Performance in Egypt was strong, led by improvements in Baroid and cementing. Our operations in Libya are improving as we have been mobilizing equipment into the country. We expect Libya to make a more substantial contribution to earnings later this year. Our Middle East Asian region revenue grew $67 million compared to last quarter. Direct sales in China accounted for approximately $13 million of this increase. We saw increased work in Australia for most of the product lines, most notably for Production Enhancement, Cementing and Sperry as customer demand for these services have increased. We also had good increases in Brunei and Malaysia for sand control, Completion Tools and drilling services. The outlook for the Middle East remains positive with good second quarter performance in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait and the UAE.  We continued to ramp up for the big Al Khurais project in Saudi Arabia, which should provide a meaningful contribution to this region’s results in the fourth quarter.  Turning to the western hemisphere, we saw strong revenue in operating income increases and the U.S. market. We are benefiting from continued strength in activity and pricing.  Over the past few months, we implemented U.S. price book increases in the range of 5% to 12%, and we continue to deploy additional equipment in the U.S., where our equipment utilization remains extremely high.  The current short-term softness in natural gas prices will slow the realization of these price book increases, but we are confident in our ability to get the price increases through later in 2006 and early 2007.  Our ability to attract and retain personnel in the U.S. market remains an important factor in meeting the continued high demands for our services in the U.S.  In the Gulf Coast, deepwater activity was much higher for us than the first quarter, with additional deepwater rigs. Deepwater activity increased primarily in sand control, Sperry and completions.  Our balanced portfolio between the deepwater work and the shelf creates opportunities to maximize the potentials of these two important areas for us. This balance minimizes the impact we see from the jack-up rigs leaving the Gulf, particularly for production optimization and Fluids division.  We recently introduced a rig-less solution for the Gulf of Mexico shelf, in which we are offering completions or re-completions as a bundled package of services with both project management and completion engineering. This has proven to be a very effective, efficient alternative for our customers to boost production.  In Canada, we were affected by the typical seasonal second quarter spring break-up, with a rig count decrease from an average of 665 rigs in the first quarter to only 282 rigs in the second quarter.  Our revenue in Canada decreased by approximately $100 million from the first quarter. The third quarter has returned to normal activity level.  Latin America’s results were relatively flat compared to last quarter. Revenue was impacted by the decrease in project management work. This month, we completed our last well on the Pemex Integrated Service project. This 33-well integrated drilling project is now finished.  Now I will turn the call to Bill Utt to address KBR.
Bill Utt: Thanks, Andy. Let me begin by saying a little more about the Escravos Project. As Dave said, we have been encountering some significant issues in the Western Niger Delta region, including recent armed attacks on convoys on the Escravos River.  We are also experiencing delays and cost increases resulting from site soil conditions, scope changes and necessary engineering and construction modifications.  In recent weeks, we have been working closely with our customer, Chevron, regarding a fast-forward. We are approximately 30% complete on the project. The project charge we recorded in the second quarter reflects our best estimate of the cost overruns we have projected to the end of the project, net of probable recoveries from our customer. We will, of course, re-evaluate our estimates on a quarterly basis going forward.  I want to reassure everyone that I am very focused on reinforcing and improving our risk-management and contracting practices. I am personally spending a great deal of my time on the details of establishing appropriate risk awareness and pricing guidelines for our company in general, and on a project-by-project basis, as we evaluate which of the many opportunities before us we should pursue.  We have in place defined levels of reviews of projects before they are bid. The intensity of the review process increases with the size of the projects and, for our largest projects, includes the review and approval by our Board Of Directors before a bid is ever made.  Our pricing of contracts is adjusted for the level of risk we believe we are undertaking. We also have increased the frequency and depth of the review of the projects as it progresses through completion, allowing management to identify issues early and address them with our customers promptly to ensure maximum recoveries of claims and change orders.  Outside of Escravos, we are pleased with the level of profitability achieved in the second quarter on the balance of our projects in the Energy and Chemicals segment. These results reflect our continued focus on effective project execution.  Let me turn to the Government and Infrastructure division, where we have had another strong quarter.  We continue to be highly rated by all of our government customers, and are now receiving the highest award fees for us today on our LogCAP 3 contract.  We are also announcing today that we have recently settled the laundry issue related to our services to the U.S. army in Iraq. As you recall, our customer was withholding $12 million of our invoices because the DCAA auditors were questioning the adequacy of our documentation supporting the quantity of laundry services we provided.  Having supplied the appropriate documentation, our customer determined that we were entitled to every penny of the $12 million that was withheld, again proving that the negative publicity we received for our work in Iraq to support the U.S. troops is unwarranted and often politically motivated.  We have now favorably settled almost all dispute issues, including dining facilities, fuel, and laundry.  You probably have heard the news last week that the Department of Defense has planned to issue a request for proposals for the LogCAP 4 contract. This is a standard part of the government contracting process. LogCAP 3 is an annually renewable project. As with previous LogCAP contracts, the government has chosen to re-compete this project at about the five-year mark.  We have been preparing for the bid process and are looking forward to the opportunity to continue to provide services to the U.S. and coalition forces on a selective basis.  We now anticipate by year-end, we will know the extent of our role in the new LogCap 4 contract.  Let me now turn the call back to Dave for some closing comments. 
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Bill. Let me close with a quick summary.  We posted yet another record quarter at ESG. Our North American work is stronger than it has ever been. Our revenue was up $28 million sequentially, not the 28% I mentioned earlier. Although natural gas prices are still in the $5.00 to $6.00 range, we believe that demand for our North American services will continue strong. Our customers tell us they plan to continue drilling through any near-term weakness in natural gas prices. Our commitment to growing the Eastern Hemisphere has begun to bear fruit with the growth we have seen this quarter plus, the award of some major, multiple-year contracts will increase momentum going forward. At KBR, we will continue to work closely with our customer on the difficult situation with the Escravos project, while focusing on growing our backlog with projects that meet our strict risk and reward requirements. As I said, we are now moving ahead with the KBR separation via a tax-free spin-off, although we will ensure the form of the separation is the most appropriate one given the market conditions. We are very pleased with the results we have had year-to-date. We see continued expansion and great opportunities in the future.  The bottom line is that this is a good market, but it will only get better into the foreseeable future. Now, we will take your questions. We will ask you to limit your comments to one question and one follow-up.
Operator: Thank you.  (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Robin Shoemaker with Bear Stearns.
Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns: Thank you, good morning. In terms of your comments about the North America pricing increases and the length of time that would be required to get those, can you just elaborate on that a little bit more? Normally you would have a full realization of a price book increase in three months, and you are saying that it might be slower this time. Is that correct?
Andy Lane: We have seen good progress, and compared to historical progress on putting price increases through, in the first-half of 2006 with the price increase we had in the fall of 2005. We have seen some slowing of acceptance of price increases here in the last month but we are confident we can get that price increase through. It may be more like six to nine months.  We did just increase our pump and services price book 12% July 1st. We are still under tremendous demand for our services. We are still turning away work that we are not able to catch today. We do not see any slowdown in that.  So tremendous demand for our services in a market where it is very tight on both people and equipment, so we think it will just take us a little longer to realize the benefit from this price increase.
Dave Lesar: Let me add one thing on North America. We have always been, as our investors know, much more bullish on North America, and the U.S. in general, maybe than some of our competitors have.  We recognize there is a lot of equipment potentially being built for the U.S. market but we just do not see that that equipment is going to have major impact in terms of the pricing and the demand structure that is out there, especially from the position that we are playing from in North America, which is basically where we are picking the customers that we are working for.  As equipment becomes available, I think it will get soaked up with the demand that we see out there. We continue to be very, very optimistic and very bullish on the North America and the U.S. market in particular.
Operator: Our next question will come from Brad Handler with Wachovia Securities.
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: Thanks very much, just a couple quick ones, please. Can you share with us the decremental margins in Canada in the quarter?
Andy Lane: With that $100 million reduction in revenue that was mentioned earlier, it was a very significant change there and, given the fixed costs, was under a real challenge with that kind of decrement to show profitability.  We would expect, Brad, a pretty dramatic recovery as we usually do in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. The second quarter is really, you are kind of just trying to break even there in Canada in that period.
Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities: Fair enough. If I could, an unrelated follow-up -- you have recorded a number of new contract wins and a lot of impressive stuff in the Eastern Hemisphere; is it possible to calibrate how much on an annual revenue basis that translates to? You gave us some sense of Al Khurais as it relates to Saudi, and that is helpful, but could you do it more broadly for all of the contracts, the big contracts awards you posted?
Dave Lesar: Let me address that one. We did say in the Al Khurais that, when it is up to full activity, that will increase our Saudi-based business by 30%, but there is a slow ramp-up in that project and we see very minimal impact in the third quarter in Saudi, a good increase in the fourth quarter and then a strong increase next year. That is still a very good project for us. The large Statoil win, the big win in cementing in Baroid and production enhancement fluid, that will really start to impact us in the fourth quarter slightly and will impact next year, primarily in 2007 with that win.  Then, the integrated bundled services package for drilling production technology will really impact us most in 2007, too.
Operator: Our next question will come from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you, good morning. I just want to get some clarity on the KBR spend one more time, just to make sure I understood correctly. On the timeframe, did you reference that the spend could be completed within six to nine months? Or were you referring more toward an IPO, along those lines?
Dave Lesar: What we are saying, Kurt, is we are now giving further detail on what the final separation is going to be, and the final separation we expect to occur within nine months in a six- to nine-month window of achieving the tax-free spin-off.  We still view an IPO as attractive. If the market is attractive, we would have an IPO before the ultimate spin-off.
Operator: Pierre Conner with Capital One.
Pierre Conner - Capital One: Good morning, everybody. Dave, first question, on the Eastern Hemisphere results -- impressive in the quarter. I wanted to know, it seems early to have gotten results from some of the reorganizations you discussed with us at the analyst meeting, so do you see further improvement as a focus because of some of things you have done, or did you get some of that it this last quarter?
Dave Lesar: I think that it was too early to have any impact from some of the reorganizational things we talked about back when we had our analyst day. I think the focus of the management team that Andy discussed and the focus on business acquisition and the positive impacts that we will get from that really are in front of us and really are not reflected in the results, nor are they really reflected in the contract wins that we have announced.  Those were really things that we have been working on for the past year or so. I think we do have some potential upside as we get the new team even more tightly focused on the Eastern Hemisphere.
Operator: We will go next to Robert MacKenzie with Friedman Billings Ramsey.
Robert MacKenzie - Friedman Billings Ramsey: Good morning. I guess my question is directed towards Andy. Within your more-bullish-than-average outlook for the U.S. market, are there any geographies and-or play types that you are less bullish on right now?
Andy Lane: No, Robert. I mean, we are very bullish on pump and services, of course, with our position there. We are very bullish on the completion market, the sand control market offshore, deepwater activity picking up -- we do very well there. We are very bullish on cementing and Baroid and completions and PE offshore. In the land market, the land marketing completion remains very competitive.  From a geographic standpoint, the Rockies are extremely strong and we see the Rockies staying very strong. The Gulf will be solid for us, and we see very good activity in the southern areas, South Texas, primarily.
Operator: Our next question will come from Dan Pickering with Pickering Energy Partners.
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners: Good morning. I wanted to come back to the Escravos project. I thought that project had been bid at a time period after we had already seen some changes to the bidding process, and I am trying to understand -- it sounds like most of the cost is in the engineering and construction changes.  What has happened in the last year that changes what needs to be done there? Is it the customer driving it or you guys driving it?
Dave Lesar: The project, the original intention to tender was issued by Chevron back I believe in the 2003 timeframe. During that period, we did a lot of work on that under some of the old regime of looking at projects. We encountered some issues there related to the quality of the feed that we were provided on that project, and some changes that we had within the execution team outside of KBR. Where the changes we have identified, you know, have affected us, is more downstream towards the on-site work in Nigeria for construction. We examined the present situation, and what we have seen with respect to the site development issues and the preparation of the site, some of the community issues arising, some of the aspects we have seen on the Niger River, as well as some global escalation in some bulk commodities, they have really -- our projected estimates in completing the project have resulted in a market change in price.  We have been working with Chevron to address these issues, particularly the issues regarding the site and the local community issues in the Escravos area to find the best way to execute the project going forward.  Unfortunately, it was different than what we had envisioned. Some of the risks that manifested themselves at this stage were ones we should have picked up in 2003, that we clearly would have picked up today.
Operator: We will now take a question from James Wicklund with Banc of America.
James Wicklund - Banc of America: Good morning. I hate to beat this too much, but when you guys plan for capital spending, and supply chain management is real critical, in terms of adding capacity or managing capacity for the North American market, are you assuming natural gas prices or rig activity -- what drives it?  I have no doubt, Dave, that business will stay strong and stay good, but the big question is: investors pay a whole lot different for something that is growing versus something that is just staying good. Do you guys in your forecast for managing capacity believe today that the U.S. level of activity will be up, or continue to stay strong in '07?
Andy Lane: We believe it will continue to increase in '07. We are planning for a robust rig count still and we are appropriately sizing. Chris mentioned we are going to ramp up our capital spending to $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2007.  We are still both very excited about the U.S. market but also our Eastern Hemisphere growth.
Dave Lesar: Let me just add, to specifically answer your question, we are planning for growth -- volume growth in North America and especially the U.S. market.  I would really refer you back to some of the comments that Jim Brown made on Analyst Day, some of the things that are driving that -- new fields, the expansion of the Barnett shale, shale developments going on in West Texas, the down-spacing that we are seeing in the Rocky Mountains, the expansion of the Bakken play in Montana, and now moving into Canada. We continue to see customers expanding not only their existing plays but new plays being developed.  When I say good, I mean good from a continued pricing standpoint and certainly growth opportunities as market expansion continues, new rigs come on -- we are building our capital accordingly.
Operator: We will take our next question from Daniel Henriques with Goldman Sachs.
Daniel Henriques - Goldman Sachs: Good morning. Just so I understand a little bit more about your timing for KBR, let's assume the scenario that, let's say five months from now, you still do not have the IRS approval but the IPO market is better. Would you still decide to go with the IPO or, given that the full separation will be so close with the spin-off, you would just wait for the spin-off?
Dave Lesar: If the IPO market is attractive, we feel there are benefits to doing an IPO first but what we are signaling here is that we do want to achieve the ultimate separation in the near term.  Although they cannot be right on top of each other, there is no minimum waiting period, for tax reasons or anything else. There have been a number of examples where there has been an IPO followed by a spin shortly thereafter.  They are not mutually exclusive. We are going to achieve the ultimate separation and, if the market is attractive, that will be preceded by an IPO.
Evelyn Angelle: I think we have time for just one more question, please.
Operator: Our final question will come from Scott Gill with Simmons and Company.
Scott Gill - Simmons and Company: Good morning. Bill, I guess this is directed towards you. When you look at the E&C part of KBR, we have not seen a lot of change in the backlog over the past couple of quarters. I was just wondering if you could give some commentary on order flow, projects that you are looking at today and -- do you think we have kind of reached a steady state in terms of order flow for this part of your business?
Bill Utt: Scott, one of the interesting things we have seen in the last 12 months, certainly with the price of oil, has resulted in a very strong increase in commodities and also the ability of our supply chain to deliver at historical prices and delivery times.  We see a lot of projects out there that I wish I was in a position to say we have in the backlog today, but because of the significant ramp-up in the cost to build these plants, the customers are digesting this new cost environment for capital projects. As a result, the projects are getting a little more scrutiny. They are getting pushed off to the right -- as we are prone to say back at KBR, they are sliding in time. The programs are going to get executed. It is just getting them through the appropriations process when the initial budgets were a lot less than what we are looking at now, but they will ultimately get completed.  I am hopeful that by the end of the year, a lot of what we thought would happened during the 2006 period would actually come to fruition, but it really has been just the customer community really digesting the appreciation of capital projects from a cost standpoint.
Operator: That would conclude our question-and-answer session today. I would like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.
Evelyn Angelle: Thank you, Millicent, and thank you to our audience. That concludes our 2006 second quarter conference call.
Operator: Thank you everyone for your participation in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good day and welcome to everyone to today's Halliburton Company first quarter 2006 results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Evelyn Angelle. Please go ahead.
 Evelyn Angelle: Thanks, good morning and welcome to Halliburton's first quarter 2006 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on our website for seven days. A podcast download will also be available on our website within 24 hours after the call. Joining me today are Dave Lesar, our CEO; Chris Gaut, our CFO; and Andy Lane, our COO. The press release announcing our first quarter results is available on our website at www.halliburton.com. We have tentatively scheduled tour 2006 second quarter earnings conference call for Friday, July 21. In today's call, Dave will provide opening remarks, Chris will discuss our overall operating performance and financial position, followed by Andy who will review the regions and our business outlook for 2006 and beyond. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks.  Before turning the call over to Dave, I would like to remind our audience that some of the today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting the Company's view about future events and their potential impact on our performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company's operations and financial results, and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements.  These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005 and recent current reports on Form 8-K. Now, I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Dave Lesar. 
Dave Lesar: Thanks, Evelyn and good morning, everyone. Let me highlight a few things about the quarter before I ask both Chris and Andy to address our results in our outlook in a little bit more detail. You will hear the word record a lot on this call, which is an indication of the very strong worldwide market we continue to see for our ESG services.  We had an excellent first quarter, and posted EPS of $0.91, of which $0.01 came from production services, which this quarter has been moved out of KBR and into discontinued operations. It is expected to be sold in the second quarter with a pre-tax gain of approximately $100 million. First, some highlights. We had record revenue in the Energy Services Group which reached $2.9 billion, up 35% from the first quarter a year ago. High activity in North America, the Middle East, the North Sea, and Russia were the big drivers for these gains. More than overcoming our anticipated decline from Landmark and direct sales, which on a combined basis were almost $77 million lower in revenue than they were in the fourth quarter. I'll say more about direct sales in a minute. Continuing on the momentum that we built in the quarter, the month of March was the first time in our history in which we reported revenues in excess of $1 billion for the Energy Services Group. Record operating income at ESG in the first quarter grew to $727 million, from $678 million in the fourth quarter and from $513 million in the first quarter 2005 which included a $110 million gain on Subsea 7. In the first quarter of 2006, we saw activity increases, and we realized good pricing improvements. Particularly in the strong U.S. market following our October 2005 price book increases. ESG's operating margin jumped to a record 24.7% in the first quarter from a 23.8% margin in the fourth quarter. This indicates to us that we are still staying ahead of the inflationary pressures that we see in our ESG businesses.  ESG's incremental margins in the first quarter were in excess of 50%. Our focus on pricing, equipment utilization, and cost control instead of market share, continues to be reflected in our results in our industry-leading return on capital employed over the past several quarters.  Drilling inclination evaluation, fluid systems, and production optimization all had record revenue and record operating income in the first quarter. Even with its usual first quarter downturn, Landmark still had record revenue and operating income for a first quarter. This is the first time in the first quarter that all of ESG's divisions had in excess of 20% operating margins. Because we continue to see a multiple-year increase in demand for our services, we are moving forward with our aggressive capital spending plans, which I mentioned last quarter will be roughly a 40% increase in ESG for this year. We are focusing on pressure pumping and high-end Sperry directional tools.  We are looking at incremental spending increases in other high-growth areas such as North America, Middle East, North Africa, and Russia. Our stellar results in North America are continuing to allow us to invest for the long term in the Middle East as demand for stimulation in drilling services remains robust. We are not only adding equipment but building infrastructure as well to capitalize on this expected growth. This will impact our results in the short term, but will have a long-term payback to our shareholders. Let me say a little bit more about direct sales, as they do have an impact on our eastern hemisphere results. I am very pleased with the success we've had in eastern hemisphere over the past two years. For example, our Russian revenues are up 67% over the prior year's first quarter, and Saudi revenues are up 74% over the prior year's first quarter.  Given the strong market we are in today, we have changed our strategy with respect to direct sales. As business has expanded, we believe we need to use our manufacturing capacity to build equipment to serve the needs of our growing service business, instead of manufacturing items for sale. Therefore, we have moved to a strategy of being opportunistic in direct sales instead of such sales being an integral part of our business strategy. Manufacturing the equipment for our services fleet of course will produce revenue slower, but over a longer period of time versus selling equipment for an immediate revenue impact. Also in the past, we have targeted direct sales with specific eastern hemisphere markets like India and China, which had little service component to them. We now believe that some of these markets have now matured to the point where we can enter them with traditional service offerings where it no longer makes sense to sell directly into them.  Both of these changes in approach will have a short-term impact on our eastern hemisphere business in terms of revenue comparisons, but we believe they are the appropriate step forward for our long-term strategy. Now, let me make a few comments on the market and pricing. As you know, natural gas spot prices in the U.S. have been fluctuating, dropping to a low of just under $6.50 last month. The prices have rebounded lately with the crude oil commodity price increase certainly helping.  We've spoken to our customers to get their perspective on how these prices might affect their spending habits now and in the future. The response from our customers has been very clear. Their spending plans continue to be robust. Our customers are moving forward with their drilling plans and in many instances looking for more rigs. We have heard that they would continue drilling until the 12-month strip dropped to the $4.50 to $5 range and we're a long way from that. We still see the fundamentals for an extended period of strong demand for our services. Let me talk now about how we see this impacting our pricing. Because of our strong view of the U.S. market, we have started a series of price increases which started on April 15, and will continue until July 1. These price increases will affect all of our PSLs except for Landmark, whose price increase will be effective October 1, which is three months earlier than usual. We see no reason to back off price increases at this time. For competitive reasons, we are not going to disclose the specifics on timing or amount by PSL, but Andy will give you some additional insight in a moment. Turning to KBR, I'm pleased to welcome Bill Utt as our now CEO. Bill comes to us with many years of industry experience, and from what I've seen so far has jumped right in and is already making an impact at KBR.  I'm also happy to report that we filed our S1 for the IPO of just under 20% of KBR last week. The next step is the SEC review process. We don't know how long that will take, but we continue to view the public market valuations of engineering and construction companies, as very favorable. We are committed to pushing the IPO forward as quickly as we can. Please keep in mind that we're precluded from speaking too much about KBR's future prospects right now because of the quiet period rules imposed by the SEC. So please don't be frustrated by the lack of details given today or in the next few months. Getting this IPO effort done has taken a huge effort on the part of our staff and outside professionals, and I want to thank them. Naturally, our first quarter 2006 corporate and KBR results were impacted by the professional costs we incurred related to this offering.  As we've said in our press release, KBR and Petrobras have agreed to operational and technical acceptance on the Barracuda-Caratinga project. We've also recently won some major awards at KBR, including the $13.9 billion Allenby and Connaught project for the U.K. Ministry of Defense, and a $400 million EBIC ammonia project in Egypt. Andy will give you more details on this. We have also received our latest award fee scores on our LogCAP work for work performed primarily in the second half of 2005. We received an average score of 95% and were rated by our customers as excellent. You will recall that we settled all issues related to the RIO contract last year.  I just want to say that despite the constant political bashing, our tens of thousands of American citizens and others working in Iraq continue to do a great job serving our brave soldiers.  We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash. I mentioned last quarter we were going to address direct returns to our shareholders with our Board of Directors. This resulted in a 20% increase in our dividend as well as a commencement of a stock buyback up to $1 billion. Looking forward to the rest of 2006, I continue to be very optimistic that the ESG market will grow at an accelerated pace. As I've said, our customers are telling us they continue to spend. We are investing and continue to invest in equipment, in people, in the right places around the world that will deliver the highest growth and income, both in the near term and in the long term.  We're in the bidding process on several LNG and GTL projects where demand continues to remain robust. We expect to hear about those in the next few quarters. Let me turn the call over to Chris now, for some additional comments. 
Chris Gaut: Thanks, Dave. Good morning. I will discuss our first quarter results compared sequentially to the fourth quarter of 2005. Halliburton Company revenue in the first quarter was $5.2 billion; that's down 7% from last quarter. ESG revenue was up $90 million or 3% sequentially with strong gains in the important North American and Middle Eastern markets, partially offset by the typical seasonal decline in the North Sea and Russia, as well as Landmark's international revenue.  KBR revenue was down $452 million, or 17% sequentially, due primarily to declines in our Iraq work and the hurricane-related repair work we've been performing for the U.S. Navy along the U.S. Gulf Coast. International revenue was 55% of the total for ESG and 66% for Halliburton as a whole in the first quarter. Revenues outside of North America for ESG were down a bit from the fourth quarter but this decline is fully explained by the typical first quarter decline in Landmark, as well as the reduction in direct sales of export equipment as we deemphasize and take a more opportunistic approach to direct sales. Our underlying international growth was also offset by winter weather in the usual markets and substantial downtime on our international stimulation vessels.  Halliburton achieved operating income of $755 million in the first quarter overall, ESG operating income increased to $727 million, reflecting a 90 basis point operating income margin improvement, led by pricing strength in North America.  KBR operating income decreased 47 million in the first quarter to $62 million due primarily to charges and losses totaling $30 million related to KBR's investment in an Australian railroad, and a $15 million charge on Barracuda-Caratinga as we have now agreed upon final acceptance of that project with our customer. Let me highlight ESG segment results. Production optimization revenue increased $43 million or 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2005. Demand for stimulation services for U.S. land rigs remained very strong, driving higher utilization and pricing; also increased rig activity in Canada and the Gulf of Mexico following the recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; as well as demand for deepwater services contributed to the revenue growth.  Outside North America, we saw a decline in the revenue generated by downtime on several of our stimulation vessels, as certain vessels were dry docked for scheduled maintenance and others were mobilized to new locations. Our completion tool sales were down compared to the very strong levels of the fourth quarter although we did see good growth in Saudi Arabia for large completion product sales and slickline activity. Looking ahead we expect production optimization to be a significant contributor to international results in the second quarter 2006. Production optimization operating income increased $33 million or 11% with a 180 basis point improvement in margins. In addition to strong U.S. land results for stimulation services, production enhancement had increased utilization in Canada.  Outside of North America, production optimization operating income was sequentially down from the fourth quarter due to the lower stimulation vessel activity and lower completion tool sales in West Africa.  In the fluid segment, revenue increased $59 million or 8% over the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase was due to Gulf of Mexico activity returning to pre-hurricane levels and higher U.S. land activity, as well as pricing improvements. Fluid Systems operating income was up $25 million or 16%. Cementing services operating income increased 18% on strength in North America and in Africa. Baroid operating income increased 11% with improved margins in North America and Asia Pacific. Our drilling and formation evaluation segment had a revenue increase of $32 million or 5% sequentially, growth was strongest in North America, Southeast Asia, and Norway, but we had lower direct sales into Asia Pacific.  Sperry showed solid growth in Latin America, Norway, and Asia Pacific. Security DBS drill bits continued their positive growth trend and posted a 7% sequential revenue increase driven primarily by activity in the Middle East and North America. We are on target to complete our fixed cutter bit manufacturing expansion by the end of the second quarter, so that we will be in good position to respond to the increased demand for these products. Drilling information evaluation operating income increased to $156 million, that's compared to 148 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, but that included a $24 million gain on an intellectual property settlement regarding our drill bit business.  Sperry posted operating income increases in all regions, except Middle East and Asia which was relatively flat due primarily to a shift to less directional drilling by a large UAE customer that Andy will discuss in a moment.  In the digital and consulting solution segment, revenue decreased as usual in the first quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter it was down by $44 million or 20%. Almost all of this decline was outside of North America. Operating income decreased from $66 million to $49 million or 26% decrease.  The reduced results related to Landmark. The first quarter is always Landmark's weakness following the traditionally strong fourth quarter based on the usual cycles in which E&P companies purchase software. In looking ahead we expect Landmark to benefit from a higher customer spending level later in 2006. Let's turn to KBR's two segments. First, government and infrastructure had revenue for the first quarter of $1.7 billion, that's compared to $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter. The decrease resulted primarily from the higher fourth quarter revenue under our LogCAP contract due to the timing of procurement for certain long lead-time equipment under that contract. In addition, we saw hurricane-related repair services for U.S. Naval facilities in the Gulf Coast decrease as this work is wrapping up. Operating income in this division decreased $35 million to $20 million in the first quarter. Our first quarter results included $30 million in costs related to our investment in a railway joint venture in Australia. KBR constructed this railway from 2001 to 2004, and we realized good profit on that construction. This is one of those situations like the Dulles toll road that we sold last year in which we retained an ownership interest in the constructed asset. The venture is now forecasting slower growth in freight volume related to mining of minerals, the mining customers, as well as delays in the planned expansion of the Port of Darwin. Because of this, we recorded an impairment charge during the first quarter on our investment. We do not have an operational role in the venture nor of course do we have any involvement with the Port of Darwin or the mining projects. We were awarded a $68 million LogCAP award fee during the first quarter, due to our excellent performance ratings for which we recorded an additional $12 million in income above our normal award fee accrual rate.  Revenues in our energy and chemical segment declined to $538 million from 594 million in the fourth quarter. Some of the decline is related to certain jobs nearing completion or in the case of our Tangu LNG project in Indonesia, a shift away from the heavy procurement activities typically incurred earlier in the project. These declines were partially offset by higher revenues on our Nigerian GTL and other LNG projects. Our operating income in this division declined by $12 million to $42 million.  Closing of the financing for the EBIC project during the first quarter resulted in approximately $24 million in additional income, as we were reimbursed for our bid costs and certain other costs previously expensed. This was offset by $15 million in projected costs that we expensed in connection with the finalization of the Barracuda-Caratinga acceptance agreement with Petrobras, and for additional warranty reserves on that project. Now, let's review other financial items. Our general corporate expenses were $34 million in the first quarter, that's compared to $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase primarily relates to increased professional services costs. We expect a run rate for the remainder of 2006 to be about $30 million as we previously indicated.  In the first quarter of 2006 we began expensing the cost of our employee stock option awards as well as our employee stock purchase plan. These costs totaled approximately $10 million in the first quarter. This $10 million in costs, along with another $7 million in costs we have always expensed related to other equity compensation, were charged to segment results where our employees are assigned.  When comparing our margins to others, keep in mind that we treat equity compensation as a direct expense while some of our competitors might exclude this expense from the margin calculation and treat it as part of G&A. From a corporate perspective, there are a few things regarding cash flow to keep in mind. This quarter we had an effective tax rate of 34%. As you recall, our tax rate in 2005 was quite low because of our strong outlook for 2006 and beyond, which allowed us to reverse much of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to the asbestos and silica settlements. Even though our effective tax rate for accounting purposes in 2006 will be approximately 35% to 36%, our cash taxes will be much lower as we are using NOLs from the asbestos and silica settlements to offset our U.S. taxable income. As of March 31, 2006, our gross debt to total capitalization ratio was 32% and our net debt to total capitalization -- taking into account our cash balance -- was 11%. Following the announcement of the stock repurchase program in February of 2006, we began repurchasing stock after our 10-K was filed in mid-March, and we repurchased approximately 600,000 Halliburton shares at an average price of $68.62 per share during the remainder of the first quarter. Let me turn it over to Andy Lane.
Andy Lane: Thanks, Chris. Good morning everyone. This morning, I will be discussing ESG's operational highlights from a regional perspective. as well as speaking to you in a little more depth about KBR. Before doing that, I'd like to spend just a few moments addressing a couple of matters that are on the minds of many investors, our outlook on ESG pricing for the rest of 2006 and resource constraints. With respect to pricing at ESG, we've continued to realize pricing gains in the U.S. since the beginning of this year, driven by our ESG price book increase effective October 15. We are continuing our focus on working down customer discounts and we expect this to improve our price realization.  The future U.S. price book increases Dave mentioned that we are implementing in the second and third quarters will be reflected in our results in the second half of this year and early 2007. Pushing through price increases when our customers' contracts turn over, both in the U.S. and internationally, is a management priority.  Demand for equipment continues to challenge all of us in the industry. We've ramped up our capital spending plan significantly for this year. We're focused on adding equipment to our strongest growth markets such as Saudi Arabia, North Africa, Southeast Asia, the North Sea, Russia, and of course North America. We continue to invest heavily to meet strong demand for our geopilot systems worldwide. In particular, we'll see more Sperry and pumping services capital come online late this year and early 2007.  From a human resource perspective, we continue to recruit aggressively worldwide for degreed professionals and skilled labor. To help us retain our talented people in our high turnover area such as the Rockies and western Canada, we've established incentive programs and specific retention programs for our field operations. Now, I'd like to point out a few highlights in each region, beginning with North America. The U.S. continues to be an incredibly strong market for us. Revenue in our pressure pumping business grew nearly 10% over the fourth quarter. That's even with a slight downturn in the Rockies due to the typical seasonal weather issues. We've opened a new multi-service field cap in Alvarado, Texas. This will better serve our customers' growing needs in the Barnett shale.  At quarter end, the Gulf of Mexico's rig count is still about 10% below the pre-hurricane levels and production remains down approximately 20%. I'm pleased to report that all of our operations are back to pre-hurricane levels. When you look at the first quarter Gulf of Mexico revenue, it was the highest quarterly revenue since the fourth quarter of 2001. Our Gulf of Mexico team has done a great job. This recovery is faster than we had predicted and we expect to realize additional operational efficiency going forward as we continue to consolidate and upgrade our facilities and exit the temporary facilities we've established in the Gulf Coast. We've realized good pricing gains in the first quarter and we expect continued strength in U.S. activity and pricing throughout the rest of the year. In Canada, we experienced excellent growth in the first quarter of 2006, from the fourth quarter of 2005, as revenue increased 23% and operating income increased 32% versus a sequential average rig count improvement of 16%. We're in spring breakup now. After breakup, we expect to see an increase in rig deployment into the Canadian market. Many of these rigs will be working in deep gas formations where our services are in high demand. Now, I'll address Latin America where we saw a revenue decline of $22 million compared to the fourth quarter of which $15 million related to the seasonal decline in Landmark. Also affecting Latin America's results was the dry docking of a simulation vessel in Mexico and the redeployment of another vessel from Brazil to a higher utilization market in West Africa.  Sperry drilling services benefited from increased demand for geopilot services in Brazil; and in Mexico we're still on track to complete the turnkey drilling project by the end of May. This will result in improved margins in Latin America in the second half of 2006. Our Europe/Africa CIS region had a revenue decline of $36 million compared to the fourth quarter of which $10 million was the result of seasonal decline in Landmark. Also impacting the quarter was the typical seasonal decline in continental Europe and the North Sea.  Offsetting these declines was an increase in Sperry drilling services with higher activity in Norway as customers returned from their fourth quarter production activities to active drilling programs in the first quarter.  Angola revenue was negatively impacted by a reduction in first quarter deepwater work for completion tools and lower vessel utilization. The low vessel utilization in the first quarter related to our customer's focus on drilling activities, which we have already seen shift to completion activities beginning in the second quarter. As a result we expect these vessels will be more highly utilized for the balance of the year. Russia had an extremely harsh winter. However, our Russia revenue was flat sequentially due to a strong March and the benefit from the deployment of additional fracturing units. We expect growth in Russia in 2006, as utilization of equipment and deployment of assets continues to increase.  Our Middle East/Asia region is the one most affected by direct sales. As Dave mentioned, this is no longer an area where we plan to allocate a great deal of manufacturing capacity. In the Asia Pacific area, for example, we had approximately $29 million less in direct sales revenue compared to the fourth quarter. Exclusive of direct sales, Asia Pacific revenue grew 3% sequentially with particularly good results for Sperry in Southeast Asia. We expect continued growth in our base Asia Pacific operations throughout the year.  In the Middle East, our completion tool business benefited from strong orders in Saudi Arabia. Well stimulation and drilling services in the Middle East also continued to be at a high demand. We see Saudi Arabia as one of our primary growth markets as drilling activity continues to ramp up.  Offsetting the rapid growth in Saudi Arabia we are seeing less demand for DFE in the United Arab Emirates as some large customers move from horizontal to vertical drilling programs. This will allow us to redeploy equipment to other, more attractive markets. We've also recently opened a new tool repair center in Jebel Ali in the Emirates which will help us increase the utilization of these tools by repairing them more quickly and getting them back into the field. Now, I'll turn to KBR. This quarter we had some very good news at KBR, along with two adjustments that Chris discussed on legacy projects, Barracuda-Caratinga, and the Australian Railroad. We're very pleased about closing the two major projects Dave mentioned, Allenby and Connaught and the EBIC ammonia plant. We continue to add quality projects reflecting KBR's core competency into our backlog. The Allenby and Connaught project in the U.K. Ministry of Defense is a $13.9 billion project which we've been operating by joint venture in which we have a 45% ownership interest. The project will last 35 years and consist of a nine-year construction project to upgrade the British Army's garrisons at Aldershot and the Salisbury Plain; in addition to services to be provided throughout the 35-year duration of the contract such as catering, transport, office, and maintenance services.  We like the risk profile of this project because the construction element is for simple buildings and the services portion of the contract is similar to work we've been doing in Iraq, but in a non-combative environment. This contract is a big step forward in executing our strategy to diversify and de-risk our government and infrastructure portfolio. We also consummated a financial close for the EBIC ammonia project, an approximately $400 million turnkey engineering procurement, construction, commissioning, and testing contract to design and construct of ammonia plant in Egypt. This is a true core competency for us since KBR has licensed more than 200 ammonia plants since 1943. Our exclusive advanced ammonia process technology positions the plant owner as a low-cost producer in the highly competitive ammonia business. Next, I want to update you on our outlook for LNG and GTL projects. We currently have four major LNG and GTL active projects, one in Indonesia, two in Nigeria, and one in Yemen. In addition, we're actively involved in a very large number of LNG and GTL feeds and project negotiation. LNG remains a core strength for KBR. Let me now turn it back to Dave for some closing comments. 
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Andy. To summarize what you've heard, we continued to experience excellent oilfield services growth in North America and other focus markets such as the Middle East, Libya, and Russia. With the activity increases our customers are creating, our attention to pricing, and our capacity additions in key markets, we should continue to experience strong growth throughout the rest of the year. In fact, we're looking forward to what we believe will be a great several years ahead of us. We're entering into an exciting new chapter at KBR. We've talked a long time about the separation of KBR and ESG. Filing the S1 last week was a big milestone. I want to assure the employees and customers of KBR that we're making sure that this first step in the separation will not disrupt our operations at KBR. It is business as usual there and we will continue to be focused on serving customers and executing contracts. Now, we'll turn it over for questions. Please limit it to one question and one follow-up.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from James Wicklund, Banc of America Securities.
James Wicklund - Banc of America Securities: Good morning, guys. Good quarter. On the energy services side, everything's rosy, everything's positive, everything's good. On a relative basis, where were you disappointed? What surprised you? Again, relative. I understand everything was great, but what would you have liked to have or expected to have seen or done better?
Dave Lesar: Jim, this is Dave. Let me answer that one. I think that on the KBR side we continue to be excited about the prospects. Obviously, getting Barracuda to final acceptance was a positive. It was a bit disappointing to have some final charges there, but we believe it is behind us at this point in time. I think the equity investment in the railroad having to be impaired is something that we wouldn't have liked, but again that's something akin, as Chris said, to the investment we made in Dulles toll road a number of years ago which did pay off for us in a big way last year, even though it didn't look good on the very front end.  I think on the ESG side, it continues to be a battle out there for people and for capital. Certainly no lack of opportunities, but I think the turnover of people is disappointing. I think that that is one area that affecting everybody in the industry, and is something that we continue to be focused on.  I think the bottom line for us is that we are very happy with the quarter, we're excited about the prospects we have, the demand for services is unprecedented out there, the amount of capital we have in the queue to come out in the next couple of quarters is very large, and we expect to be able to put it right to work.
James Wicklund - Banc of America Securities: In terms of turnover, are you losing people to competitors or directly to your customers? Or to some other industries?
Dave Lesar: I would say, Jim, you certainly have a base turnover as people come in, experienced in the oilfield business. The oilfield business in the field is a tough business. It's physical work, it's long hours in this market. We do lose people outside the industry.  I would say that we do have a large amount of customer poaching going on of our people in the industry today, as they struggle with their own growth rates and their own demographic issues. Clearly, there is some churn between the service companies, but that's not really as major an issue as you think it would be.
Operator: Our next question will come from Daniel Henriques with Goldman Sachs. Mr. Henriques, your line is open, please go ahead.
Daniel Henriques - Goldman Sachs: My question is about seasonality in international markets. If you take a look at non-North American revenues in operating income this quarter, the percentage decline sequentially was almost the same as of the first quarter of '05. Is there any reason beyond normal seasonality? Anything in terms of growth outlook or cost of that growth to be a little bit more concerned on the margin with the quarter?
Andy Lane: It was largely and almost fully impacted by just the seasonality that we spoke of, the $77 million revenue difference, when you look at Landmark and our direct sales deltas. We continue to invest in Russia, Libya, Saudi, and in West Africa as our key markets. We continue down the path we've been there. We had excellent results in a lot of areas that we want to highlight in Australia, in Malaysia, and Thailand, Saudi, and Oman in the Middle East/Asia were all great performers for us in the first quarter. Norway and the Caspian, Nigeria and Egypt were real strong also in the first quarter for us, and in Latin America, Brazil, and Argentina. The ones that were impacted most by the seasonality in both activity and Landmark was the UAE in China for direct sales, Russia with the weather, really the first two months of the quarter were impacted, but we're very encouraged by the new frac equipment going to work in March, they had the best month ever in Russia for us; that is a good sign for the rest of the year in Russia.  Angola deepwater activity we mentioned is coming back strong and we're investing in Libya growth. So there's a lot of positives out there and nothing unusual that we didn't expect. The first quarter has always historically been our low quarter.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jim Crandell with Lehman Brothers.
Jim Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Good morning. Could you comment on the magnitude of U.S. stimulation price increases versus recent quarters? In the quarter, do you think that customer wait times and job turndowns are increasing at this point?
Chris Gaut: First, customer turndowns and job times are about the same as the fourth quarter. Still a very, very high activity level. Now, I updated you on pricing last quarter, and we had approximately 40% of our customer base on our October 2005 price book. We now have approximately 60% to 65% of our customer base on our latest price book increase. Then Dave mentioned the increases that are coming in the second and third quarter, but we are not going to give out the percentage of that increase.
Dave Lesar: Jim, this is Dave. Let me just add to that a bit. I think what we have found since we have pricing leadership and a number of PSLs in North America, that our competitors have tended to sort of tuck in behind us on our price increases and draft off the work that we've done. So I think that we are now taking a more discrete approach to how we implement those price increases and we are not going to be as public as to where, when, and how much. There certainly was no loss of momentum in terms of pushing toward higher prices in Q1, and we do not believe that that will change as we go forward this year.
Jim Crandell - Lehman Brothers: Okay, is it possible to comment whether your net pricing improvement during the quarter was greater than that of the last couple of quarters?
Andy Lane: Yes, it was certainly no less than Q4, and it was accelerating during 2005, Jim.
Operator: Our next question will come from Ken Sill, Credit Suisse.
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Good morning, guys. I'm going to try to ask a question about KBR that I hope you can answer. It relates to the capacity in terms of engineering. One of your competitors had said that engineering talent for both the oilfield was one of their big issues and we're starting to hear rumors of some of the E&C companies getting better terms and extending out business because they don't have capacity to do it. Is that a constraint in how quickly things can grow at the KBR backlog side over the next few years, or will it just stretch projects out?
Dave Lesar: Ken, on the KBR side, as you see LNG and GTL projects expand, there will be and there is already a very tight market for the key technical resources. But we're able to replace the resources and turnover we have had. It's going to be a issue for all companies in the E&C sector, but we feel very good about where we're placed and the resources we have for all the prospects we see coming in 2006.  We continue to add 300 to 400 people a week for the GNI business, to support Iraq so that's still a very big effort for us. If you look at the ESG side where we added almost 10,000 people last year in 2005, we continue to be able to attract people to the industry and the big issue is getting them trained and developed and retaining them after that point.  So there isn't a shortage of being able to attract people and the talent and skills we need from both the KBR and ESG perspective, but retention and development are key issues for everyone.
Ken Sill - Credit Suisse: Then a follow-up, you were talking about pricing a lot of segments. I didn't really see any comments or hear anything about the drilling fluid business or Baroid. Are prices improving in the fluids business? Because it seems like most of that growth was attributable to volume and mix.
Dave Lesar: Pricing's improving slightly in the drilling fluids business for us. It remains extremely competitive with some large projects being bid in the eastern hemisphere and it's not as robust pricing-wise as the rest of the pumping services and some of our other product service lines.
Andy Lane: A lot of that business is bid whereas maybe stimulation are cementing more on the price book.
Operator: Our next question comes from James Stone with UBS.
James Stone - UBS: I just wanted to ask a couple of questions, the first is when you look at your CapEx budget, can you just give us a sense of how much of that spending is going towards the domestic market versus the international market for 2006? On the ESG side.
Chris Gaut: Right, we haven't broken that out. It's expanding significantly on both sides. The growth rate outside North America is higher than North America, for the reasons that Dave mentioned during the presentation. We are not backing off in any way in our capital spending estimates for the year. March was our highest rate of deliveries that we've had ever, and we expect that high rate of deliveries of new capital equipment to continue into Q2 and for the rest of the year, bringing us to the guided level that we said of $750 million to maybe close to $800 million of capital spending within ESG for the year.
James Stone - UBS: Just related to KBR -- well, actually not so much KBR but with the IPO now on schedule and the potential proceeds from that with the cash balance -- do you see yourselves getting even more aggressive with the buyback program that you already have in place?  I realize you were out of the market for a long period of time in the first quarter, but I'm just trying to get a sense as to how you map that out as you go through the year because you do have a lot of cash coming in the door on top of a mountain sitting on the balance sheet.
Dave Lesar: We are fortunate to have a good cash position. Of course our first priority with cash is organic growth in our capital program, acquisitions, and then returning cash to shareholders with our higher dividend and with the approved stock repurchase program. We are taking an opportunistic approach with the stock repurchase program and therefore, can't comment on what levels we'd be buying and what we wouldn't be buying.  Certainly we'd be aggressive on any weakness in the stock, it goes without saying. We have the program in place, it started up and we're going to be opportunistic in looking to buy into any weakness here.
Operator: Our next question come from Dan Pickering with Pickering Energy.
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy: Good morning, guys. When we look at the price increase that you're putting in place, I wanted to clarify -- is it North America or international as well? Also, what percentage of your customer base is exposed to that, here in the short term? In other words, how much business is now long term and will take a little while to roll over?
Andy Lane: Yes, Dan, good morning. There's a succinct difference with the eastern hemisphere and the western hemisphere. The eastern hemisphere, much longer term contracts, much harder, takes longer to roll over new pricing, and see the results of that. We're very positive on the steps we're taking in the eastern hemisphere but that market you won't see as quick a impact to our pricing efforts and the management priority we're putting on that.  The western hemisphere you have a lot more transactional business, you see a quicker return from that. So we're still, as Dave said, very bullish on the market and there's very tight supply and demand. So we will see pricing improvements for the first quarter on this year.
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy: So the new price book is both domestic and international?
Andy Lane: We have one price book, a global price book. The bigger impact will be a focused on the U.S. market.
Dave Lesar: The domestic market tends to be more oriented towards the price book, the international tends to not be, it tends to be a bid market.
Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy: Thank you. Chris, I'm not sure if you quantified in aggregate the export sales decline quarter-to-quarter? I heard the number in Asia which was about $30 million. Was that the total decline?
Chris Gaut: Just looking at China and India and DFE, which is by far the bulk of the change, that's about $31 million reduction in Q4 to Q1.
Dave Lesar: Then there's another $4 million, $35 million total.
Operator: Our next question comes from Scott Gill, Simmons & Company.
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: Good morning, gentlemen. Dave, I want to go back to your comments, your change in strategy with respect to using your capacity to build for your own account as opposed to direct sales. Can you give us some sort of indication on a trailing 12-month basis how much revenue is attributable to direct sales? If you could contrast the profitability between direct sales and traditional revenue?
Chris Gaut: Scott, on profitability, in general, the margins on the direct sales are not that different from our overall profitability, if not a little bit less. It has helped us from time to time on the overall efficiency of our manufacturing and fabrication business, but as we've said, with the higher utilization internally. The opportunity to earn better margins over time on a sustained basis, and not wanting as we move into these markets of China and India, for instance, that Dave mentioned, not wanting to compete against our own equipment, it just doesn't make as much sense overall. So we will be opportunistic there with a general de-emphasis of it.
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: How big is that, Chris, as far as annual revenue goes?
Chris Gaut: It's varied from year to year, Scott. We're not wanting to quantify what it is in a particular year. Although it will be de-emphasized here going forward, as we've said.
Scott Gill - Simmons & Company: Chris if I could follow-up with that. Is the strategy here to get completely out of direct sales or is it just to start reducing the amount of direct sales?
Chris Gaut: Reduction on emphasis and taking a more opportunistic approach.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) We'll take our next question from Roger Read with Natexis Bleichroeder.
Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder: Good morning. Just as a follow-up on direct sales, what is it about the markets in China and India that have most changed that lead you to want to go in from a more aggressive service as opposed to a direct sales component?
Dave Lesar: Roger, this is Dave. I think traditionally those markets have not demanded a high level of traditional western service company activities, in many cases it was please sell us your equipment and we'll supply the service labor. Those markets have matured, in our view, to the point where we believe that we can run a profitable service business in those places. Therefore, it's in our best interest, as Chris said, not to compete against our own equipment in the long run. Therefore, we have engendered this change in strategy that we have.
Roger Read - Natexis Bleichroeder: As a follow-up to that, how long do you think it will take to make those markets meaningful to your overall results? Or at least, let's say, maybe equal to or exceeding the direct sales that you've been making historically? 
Dave Lesar: It certainly will take several years.
Operator: Our next question will come from Geoff Kieburtz with Citigroup.
Dave Lesar: We'll make this the last question, if we could.
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: Good, hopefully I won't get cut off. Actually two questions, if I could, one a near-term question. In North America, ESG you brought $105 million of additional EBIT from $160 million of additional revenue. Is that kind of incremental sustainable?
Chris Gaut: That's an awfully high hurdle. I think that's reflective of very good pricing improvements that we had during the quarter. So to answer your question, Geoff, no, I don't think that percentage is sustainable, but very good percentages are sustainable.
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: Was there anything kind of unusual that resulted in that?
Chris Gaut: Kind of a utilization.
Dave Lesar: Geoff, you're seeing the big improvement in the Gulf of Mexico from fourth quarter where we were really down; to the first quarter, back to normal activity.
Chris Gaut: Covering the fixed costs in Canada and the Gulf Coast, those are going back, plus pricing.
Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup: The longer term question is, if we were to do a hypothetical here and just assume the demand was there, what kind of top line growth do you think ESG could sustain on a three to five-year horizon? Given all that you've said about tightness and availability of equipment, people, so on.
Dave Lesar: We don't want to get boxed on a guidance there, but we see a very positive fundamental outlook for our business. We see, in the North America market, quite a few rigs being added. Good growth in non-rig activity. Eastern hemisphere rapid increase in demand for services. So over the three to five-year horizon, we're very constructive on the outlook and we see no signs of any slowing at this point in time.
Operator: That would conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.
 Evelyn Angelle: This is Evelyn Angelle, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. If some did not get in on questions I'll be available all day for questions here at the office. With that, I'll conclude the call, everyone have a nice day.
Operator: Thank you for your participation on today's conference, you may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to today’s Halliburton company Fourth Quarter 2005 Results Conference Call. Today’s call is being recorded, at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations Ms. Evelyn Angelle.
Evelyn Angelle, Vice President of Investor Relations: Thanks Dustin. Good morning and welcome to Halliburton’s fourth quarter 2005 earnings release conference call. Today’s call is being webcast and a replay will be available on our website for seven days. We are also pleased to announce that we are the first among our peers to offer a podcast download, which will also be available on our website within 24 hours after the call. Joining me today are David Lesar, our CEO; Christopher Gaut, our CFO; and Andrew Lane, our COO. The press release announcing our fourth quarter results is available on our website at www.halliburton.com. We have tentatively scheduled our 2006 first quarter earnings conference call for Friday, April 21st 2006 at 10:00 a.m. Central Standard Time. In today’s call, Dave will provide openings remarks, Chris will discuss overall operating performance and financial results followed by Andy covering strategy and our business outlook into 2006. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. Before turning the call over to Dave, I would like to remind our audience that some of today’s comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting the company’s view about future events and their potential impact on our performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact the company’s operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st 2004, Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30th 2005 and recent current reports on Form 10-K. Now, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, David Lesar.
David Lesar, CEO: Thank you Evelyn and good morning everyone. Chris and Andy will discuss our fourth quarter results in some detail; however, I wanted to begin by sharing with you some of the highlights. First, we posted fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of 208. We will talk in a minute about $540 million deferred tax asset evaluation allowance reversal excluding that benefit our earnings per share were $1.06. Our energy services group growth continued with a 10% growth from the third to the fourth quarter of which 2/3rd came from outside North America. Outside of North America revenue was up 13% and operating income increased 33%. And for the first-time ever all four ESG divisions had operating margins in excess of 20%. Also, clearly our pressure pumping businesses remained exceptionally strong for us. Our ESG operating margins increased from 21.8% in the third quarter to 23.8% in the fourth quarter. At KBR we had another profitable quarter and put to rest all remaining issues under the RIO contract in Iraq. From a consolidated standpoint, we generated $874 million in cash from operations during the fourth quarter. Our strong outlook on 2006 and beyond allowed us to reverse a substantial portion of the deferred tax evaluation allowance we originally setup as part of the asbestos and silica settlement. This means we will be able to utilize those tax losses to offset US tax payments in the future. Our strong cash flow and positive market outlook on future growth has also caused us to increase our plan capital spending substantially for 2006. I would like to spend a few minutes reflecting on the performance for the full year 2005. ESG posted 26% growth in revenue from 2004 to 2005. This reflected strength in each of our four divisions driven by our industry leading position in pressure pumping. The more compelling story though is the dramatic increase in our profitability, while ESG revenues increased by 26%, operating income grew by 80%, reflecting a 48% incremental margin for the year. Our operating margins were nearly 23% for the year compared to just 16% in 2004. We benefited from the strong demand for natural gas drilling, the production related services in North America and leveraged our substantial market positions throughout the world. Our customers very much recognize our unique ability to deliver quality products and services and are willing to pay a premium to those technologies that will allow them to drill wells more efficiently and to dramatically accelerate and increase their production on those wells. KBR’s performance was also a highlight for 2005. After years of working through difficult projects that generated significant losses, our efforts to restructure KBR in 2004 showed up in 2005. On the energy and chemical side our backlog moved away from the final stages of executing difficult legacy projects to newly awarded LNG and gas-to-liquids projects. KBR’s management focused on project execution, allowed the EMC division to deliver operating margins in excess of 6% for 2005, a margin that is unprecedented for KBR. The government and infrastructure division also had a great year posting margins in excess of 4%. KBR’s management focused on working with our customers to resolve disputes related to our work in Iraq. Including those disputes that have received a great deal of media attention such as dining facilities and fuel. Both of these matters were fully resolved during 2005, resulting in our government and infrastructure division recognizing additional income for award fees. But hasn’t had much media coverage because I suspect it was positive news for us. But their recent resolution of all outstanding issues in the RIO contract including the Iraq fuel importation matter, as well as additional issues under the LOGCAP contract. As you know, Halliburton has and continues to receive a lot of media attention regarding our purchasing of fuel. We have now been paid a total of $1.1 billion relating to our Iraq fuel purchasing work. This represents 100% of the costs we incurred related to this task. So, after all the government audit processes were completed we received compensation for every penny we spent to buy fuel for Iraq. This final resolution shows that our procedures were in compliance with the direction we received from our customer. Now with respect to our commitment to separate KBR from Halliburton, we will of course be guided by the objective of maximizing shareholder value, and current plan is to file for an initial public offering for KBR soon after we file our 10-K. We believe the IPO market in general and the public market for engineering and construction companies in particular is very interactive and a public evaluation of KBR would benefit Halliburton’s stock price. Evaluation multiples of publicly traded engineering and construction firms are currently very favorable. Chris will give you more details in his section of this presentation. Before I turn the call over to Chris, let me say a few words about the future. You heard others talk about their expectations of revenue growth in the energy services business for 2006 and beyond. As you know, our practice is not to provide revenue guidance. However, I will say that we operate in the same markets as our competitors and we are also very optimistic that the market will continue to grow at an accelerated pace. And we believe additional price increases will be warranted, as equipment and labor remain tight. We will also have volume growth due to increase capital spending. We believe that North American market will continue to grow strongly in 2006 and beyond and therefore we will deploy additional capital and labor resources into this important market. Similarly, we expect the regions outside North America will continue to strengthen as we execute our aggressive growth in investment strategy. We believe our fastest growing international markets in 2006 will be the Middle East, North Africa, Russia, and the deep-water offshore markets. We are very pleased with KBR’s recent success in being awarded government contracts outside of Iraq and in the gas monetization area that capitalize on our strength in LNG and gas-to-liquids. As we said last quarter, we expect a slowdown in Iraq with related work going forward. So, we are focusing on diversifying our portfolio into G&I division. All of this success has resulted in significant cash balances and expected free cash flows. We planned to use cash to make additional investments in growing our business worldwide, both organically through capital investments and through complimentary technology focused in geographic acquisitions. For example, we expect our capital standing in ESG to be up almost 40% in 2006. We will also be looking at how we can directly enhance shareholder value by increasing our dividend and resuming our stock buyback program. We will discuss these matters with our board of directors at our February meeting. Now, I will turn the call over to Chris and he will give you more details on the quarter.
Christopher Gaut, CFO: Thanks Dave. I will briefly review the drivers of our fourth quarter results compared sequentially to the third quarter. Halliburton company revenue in the fourth quarter was $5.8 billion and that is up 14%. ESG revenue was up $251 million or 10% sequentially. KBR revenue, which benefited from our work recently awarded LNG and GTL projects was up $452 million or 18% sequentially. International revenue was 58% of the total for ESG and 71% for Halliburton as a whole. Halliburton achieved record operating income of $779 million in the fourth quarter. Overall, ESG operating income increased by $112 million reflecting at 200 basis point operating margin increase, while approximately 1/3rd of the improvement came from the strong demand for natural gas drilling in North America, all four regions and all four business segments showed double-digit percentage growth in operating income. Operating income outside of North America was up 33% compared to the prior quarter. ESG as a whole had a 23.8% operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2005. KBR operating income decreased $29 million in the fourth quarter to $129 million. Recall that the third quarter results included the $85 million of income from the sale of our interest in the toll road and $70 million of losses due to our Algerian operations. Now, I will highlight the ESG segment results. Production optimization revenue increased $124 million or 11% compared to the third quarter of 2005. Our industry leading technology in the area of Pinpoint well stimulation continued to deliver excellent performance especially in North America. Production optimization operating income increased 17% or $44 million with 110 basis point improvement in margins, in addition to strong US land results, production enhancement, and increased utilization of resources in Canada and the West Africa and increased activity in Algeria. Completion tools had excellent performance in the fourth quarter. Revenue in completions grew 20% and operating income grew 51% reflecting increased activity in the eastern hemisphere, which we define as all of our regions outside of North and Latin America, as well as recovery in the Gulf of Mexico. In the fluid system segment, revenue increased $46 million or 6% over the third quarter of 2005 and operating income was up $18 million or 13%. Cementing services operating income increased 17% on strength in North America and Latin America, partially offset by decreased activity in Africa. Baroid operating income increased 5% with improved margins of Latin America, partially offset by the continued impact of the hurricanes. Our drilling information evaluation segment had a revenue increase to $27 million or 5% sequentially of which more than half came from operations in the eastern hemisphere. While Sperry drilling services reported double-digit percentage growth over the third quarter of 2005 in the Middle East, Asia region, and in the US. Sperry’s Africa revenue declined and Sperry also experienced weakness in the North Sea as customers shifted their activity on some rigs from drilling to production related activities during the quarter. Security DBS Drill Bits continued its positive growth trend hosting an 8% sequential revenue increase driven primarily by activity in Asia and North America. We are experiencing growing demand for our fixed cutter bits. So we are currently expanding our fixed cutter manufacturing capacity. The logging services revenue grew 14% primarily as a result of improvements in the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. Drilling information evaluation operating income increased $19 million over the third quarter, included in this increase is $24 million gain on an intellectual property settlement regarding our drill bit business. This division also recorded $4 million inventory charge during the fourth quarter. Andy will discuss direct sales in a moment. In the digital and consulting solution segment, revenue increased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter by $54 million or 32%. Operating income increased from $35 million to $66 million, some 89% increase. The improved results related almost entirely to the Landmark Graphics business. The fourth quarter is always Landmark’s strongest, but this year was exceptionally impressive. Landmark’s consulting, software, and data management businesses all did very well and looking ahead, Landmark should clearly benefit from the expected increase in exploration activity in 2006. Now, I will discuss our two KBR segments. The government and infrastructure revenue for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $2.1 billion compared to 1.9 billion for the third quarter. The increase resulted from higher Iraq revenue related to the timing of procurement of certain long lead time equipment and greater government services activity for US naval facilities repair work along the gulf coast. Government and infrastructure’s operating income for the fourth quarter was $55 million, that’s down $94 million or 63% from the third quarter. The decrease is primarily the result of $85 million in third quarter income on the scale of our interest in the toll road, and the difference in third and fourth quarter settlements related to the Iraq work. In the fourth quarter, the gulf coast naval facilities work and higher activity at the DML shipyard in the UK were larger contributors to operating income. In the energy and chemical segment, revenue for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $816 million, that’s 33% increase from the third quarter. The increase is due to operations and maintenance projects in North America and the UK, as well as work on the recently awarded LNG and GTL projects. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $66 million versus only $1 million in the third quarter. We recognized $70 million in loss related to our Algerian projects during the third quarter. Operating income also increased in the fourth quarter as a result of the GTL project and performance bonuses on an upstream engineering contract in the Caspian. As David mentioned, we are moving forward with our plans to separate KBR. We have previously set out three preconditions for the separation and we believe KBR has sufficiently progressed each of these. KBR has shown good profitability in 2005 and has significantly increased its backlog. We have also seen good progress in resolving the major Iraq issues and disputes. The FCPA investigation has expanded to look at Halliburton’s use of other agents in Nigeria and in other countries. We are cooperating with the government. Our board has appointed a committee of the board to oversee the investigation and we are supplying additional information, but the investigation is likely to be ongoing for sometime. We will continue to update our disclosure in our Form 10-K and in our planned H1 for KBR, which we expect to file as soon as our Form 10-K end of 2005 audited financial statements of KBR are complete. Our plan at this point is a 20% IPO of KBR. However, in response to interest we have received, we may consider selling some pieces of KBR but we would not expect such sales to change our IPO plans. In preparation for the KBR separation, in December 2005, KBR entered into an $850 million unsecured five-year revolving credit facility. Now, looking at some other financial items, our general corporate expenses were $20 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $26 million in the third quarter of 2005. The decrease was largely due to lower professional fees and a gain on in insurance item. We expect a run rate in 2006 of $28 million to $30 million dollar per quarter for our corporate expenses. Let me explain our tax accounting. During the fourth quarter, we completed our three-year plan, which caused us to revise upward our estimate of domestic taxable income in the year 2006 and beyond. As a result we have recorded a $540 million favorable adjustment to evaluation allowance during the fourth quarter of 2005. Excluding this $540 million adjustment for future utilization of our NOL, the fourth quarter effective tax rate would have been about 22%. In 2006 and thereafter, we believe our effective tax rate will be back in the range of 35% to 37%. However, keep in mind that about half of that accounting tax expense will be non-cash due the utilization of our NOL for the next several years and should be added back to cash flow contributing roughly a dollar per share to cash flow. Beginning of 2006 we will expense the cost of our employee stock option awards and our employee stock purchase plan. We expect incremental impact of this change and accounting principle to be approximately $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share for the quarter. Lets discuss our liquidity, our working capital position on our government services work in the Middle East improved to about $500 million at December 31st as we collected large payments in connection with the full settlement of the RIO contract. In response to our customers planned increase is in the E&P spending. We estimate that ESG’s capital spending will increase by almost 40% from $575 million in ESG capital spending of 2005 to about $800 million in 2006. KBR’s 2006 capital spend will be approximately the same as 2005. We expect BDNA for 2006 to be about $550 million. I am pleased to announce that we have achieved our debt to total capitalization goal a ratio of less than 35%, which will and that’s well ahead of our original timeline. Cash and marketable securities increased almost $300 million at December 31st compared to the prior quarter. This cash increase is after we repaid $300 million in senior notes in October and we retired at $256 million ESG accounts receivable securitization facility. Andy.
Andrew Lane, COO: Thanks Chris. Good morning everyone. As you can see we finished the year with very strong results. I want to start by briefly recapping some of our major achievements in executing again some improvement plan. At ESG we have taken a leadership role in pricing, controlled our cost in the growth market and optimized our manufacturing base to achieve better throughput. Manufacturing delivered a record $1.25 billion in shipments during 2005. We posted over $1 billion in improved ESG operating income results in 2005 over 2004 and $2 billion in topline growth. On a relative basis the improvements we made at KBR was even more dramatic. We completely changed the cost structure of the business and instituted a highly disciplined approach to project selection and execution. We improved KBR’s operating income by $840 million in 2005. As a result, KBR is now in great position to capitalize on robust gas monetization trends. Now let me discuss ESG’s fourth quarter performance. We significantly improved the margins from the eastern hemisphere. Margins increased from 17.8% to 20% driven by improved results in Saudi Arabia, Angola, The UK, and China. Western hemisphere operating margins also improved increasing from 24.3% to 26.3% largely from improved pricing, higher equipment utilizations, and increased activity in the US and improved performance in both Mexico and Venezuela. In North America, incremental margins were 48% again illustrating the operational leverage of our core pressure pumping businesses. In North America in 2005, we increased revenue by 34%. Our rate in pricing improvement increased over the second half of 2005. Currently, we estimate we had 70% of our customer base on a 2005 price book and we have 40% of our October 2005 price book already in place. We anticipate additional price increases as demand for all of our services remains very strong. We estimate the hurricane impact was approximately $17 million in operating income in the fourth quarter. The most effective operations were Baroid production enhancement and cementing. Our Cameron and Venice facilities required additional repairs before becoming fully operational. However, we are now able to fully serve all of our customer needs from our other Gulf Coast facilities. We are taking this opportunity to rebuild, modernize, and consolidate some of our facilities in this area, which will yield longer-term operational benefits. While the situation has improved we estimate approximately $12 million impact in operating income in the first half of 2006. We expect insurance proceeds to offset some of these losses. In Mexico we will complete turnkey drilling project this spring, and have already relieved one of the seven rigs. We expect our margins in Mexico to improve further upon completion of this project. Activity in the Middle East and particularly Saudi Arabia continues to improve driven by production enhancement and demand for our rotary steerable systems. In the fourth quarter we saw an increase in direct sales in China and India, which contributed approximately $11 million in additional operating income. We prioritized our manufacturing capacity to build service equipment for own use first with direct sales as a secondary priority. The service equipment that we sell is typically subjected to 9 to 12 month lead time for manufacturing. Now let me turn to KBR, as we mentioned for several quarters we expect our Iraq work on the LOGCAP III to see an even more rapid decline during 2006 than we saw in 2005 as compared to 2004. We have been focused on diversifying our GNI portfolio in preparation for this decline. For example, we continue to expand our work for the US Navy under our CONCAP, construction and contingency contract and we are positioned for future contingency work for the US Air force under AFCAP and we further strengthen our position through the UK Ministry of Defense. For E&C we are pleased with the growth in LNG and gas-to-liquids projects. If you look back at the year, we won some significant new LNG contracts. We are now starting to see some of these large contracts in our results and there is continuous momentum in 2006 with several new projects planned. Worldwide for the industry, we expect contract for 14 new liquefaction trains representing 68 million tonnes of additional capacity to be awarded in 2006 and 2007. KBR is the industry leader in this business having participated in over 50% of the recent capacity construction and we are confident we can win our share of this new work. Last quarter I mentioned that a new detention was being placed for the need for increased petroleum refining capacities. In the fourth quarter KBR was selected to provide conceptualizations, planning, and early design services for a major refinery expansion in the US. We believe refineries and refinery upgrades will be a growth area for us. It is clear that our strength in the fourth quarter included every division and every region with a strong finish to a great year. There are many reasons to look at 2006 and beyond with confidence. We turn it back to Dave for closing comments.
David Lesar, CEO: Thanks Andy. I began this call by describing our Stellar 2005 results. What we have achieved in 2005, I believe showed the value of the strategy we have followed for several years. Halliburton’s fundamentals are in place and we are clearly and eagerly looking forward to excellent growth in 2006 and beyond. For the Energy Services Group this means continuing to be the leader in pricing, needs more improvements in the productive use of our equipment and adding capacity in growth areas. For KBR, this means capitalizing on our strengths in LNG and GTL diversifying the applications of our government and infrastructure skill set. Before closing, I would like to preempt one possible question. We too have heard some merger rumors recently involving our company. We just don’t comment on rumors. Having said that, I just want to say that today we are totally focused on the separation of KBR from Halliburton. I want to thank our customers, who saw the value of our work and stuck with us through the difficult year. I want to thank our employees who continued to work with us and innovate to all of our businesses. We are looking forward to what we believe will be a great several years. Now, we will take your questions. We ask you to limit to one question and one follow-up per caller. So, lets go to the first question.
Operator: Thank you sir. Today’s question and answer session will be conducted electronically. If you do have a question at this time you may signal by pressing *1 on your touchtone phone. If you are using a speakerphone today, we ask that you make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment and so once again *1 for questions. We will go first to James Stone with UBS.
Q - James Stone: Dave, and thanks for giving a lot of varying information, thanks for the rest of lot of stories. I just want to touch on some of the operational things in the quarter, and Chris you talked a little bit about the decline that you saw in operating income at DFE in the quarter. I am wondering if it was a little bit more to that than just a sort of mix shift in the North Sea or Africa, you know, what is the prognosis or the outlook for that business as we head into 2006, particularly on the directional drilling side?
A - Chris Scott: We think the outlook for Sperry directional drilling and DFE as a whole is positive. We as you said were impacted by several rigs moving to more production and completion activity in the North Sea and some lower sales in Africa. And actually you saw the other side of that in our completions business were they had higher activity in the fourth quarter, but we had very good growth in the directional drilling business in the Middle East and Asia and we expect that to continue and we expect the mix shift and the rig activity is other areas to balance that and shift that going forward.
Q – James Stone: Okay, as you look at the IPO KBR, have you settled on a management structure for that business at this point, what’s left to be done there?
A - David Lesar: James, this is Dave, let me answer that one. As you know, we have brought Cedric Burgher back into the company and announced that last quarter to be the Chief Financial Officer for KBR and Cedric will obviously be in the CFO position that leads KBR through that. We have had an ongoing search for a new CEO for KBR and it will be someone who comes in from the outside and we got that search going on. We are down to a shortlist and we would hope to have a finalist for that shortly and I think the rest of the KBR management team inside the business today is a great management team. They certainly have showed that and we believe that collectively there will be a fantastic team going forward in the IPO.
Q – James Stone: That is great, thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Geoff Kieburtz at Citigroup.
Q – Geoff Kieburtz: Thanks very much, Andy I would like to come back to your comment on the equipment sales to Asia in particular. I think you gave us an $11 million EBIT contribution in the quarter. Could you give us a little bit more information on that, like what was the contribution for the full year? Can you give us some sense of how that fluctuates?
A – Andrew Lane: Yeah, Jeff, let me just say the few points on direct sales in general. Primarily this is in our DFE division, although some of the other divisions have occasional direct sales. This is the way we classify direct sales as selling service equipment. The local service providers in markets that we do not directly compete in for their own services. It is generally older generation technology and so for DFE for all of 2005 it totaled $95 million, $34 million in the first half. There was $24 million in the third quarter, $37 million in the fourth quarter. Now, we usually ramp-up in the end of the year with our direct sales shipments, so seasonally it falls off in the first quarter and we expect to see that again in the first quarter. Other direct sales were $10 million in fluids and $14 million in PO, so that’s the scale of our direct sale business.
Q - Geoff Kieburtz: Okay, just unclear there, the total revenue from direct sales in the fourth quarter was around $50 million?
A – Andrew Lane: Yes, total revenue from direct sales in the third quarter was $31 million and in the fourth quarter was $58 million.
Q - Geoff Kieburtz: And that $58 million revenue’s what drove the $11 million EBIT contributions?
A – Andrew Lane: Exactly.
Q - Geoff Kieburtz: Okay. Separate question on KBR if I could. Can you give us some idea what the bonus accruals were on the Iraq work and maybe elaborate a little bit on what looks like unexpectedly strong margins in energy and chemicals?
A – Andrew Lane: Yes, first on the bonus accruals, we do not have an award fee in the fourth quarter for award board review. So, they were just our standard accruals, which I think we previously mentioned we grew at 72% of our total award. We expect an Iraq award and a Kuwait award here in February for the second half of 2005 business, but we will have new award scores here in the next month, but we expect them to be very strong. In E&C what you are seeing is the consistent base business, you are seeing that the ramp down of the previous legacy project, many in the upstream business and the ramping up of the LNG and GTL projects that we brought in the last 12 to 18 months. So, it was a very solid quarter for E&C and we have a good outlook for that segment.
Q - Geoff Kieburtz: Do you think that these, I think previously you sort of suggested that those margins were sustainable more in the 5% range and they seem to be staying well above that?
A – Andrew Lane: Geoff, we have been saying that we want them to be at least five. And yeah I would say the fourth quarter is behind that range. We are not saying that it is going to be there every quarter, but we would be very disappointed if it is not 5% on an annual basis.
Q - Geoff Kieburtz: Great, thanks very much.
Operator: We will take our next question from James Wicklund, Banc of America Securities.
Q - Jim Wicklund: Good morning everybody, great quarter and thank you. Guys, I hate to ask this question please forgive me but I am up in New York and there has been a rumor rampant in every meeting that I have gone to that you were scheduled to announce a major acquisition as early as today. Realizing the limitations on conversations, we are asking you to talk about the potentials of Halliburton in making major acquisitions in all of your service business going forward?
A – Andrew Lane: Jim, I think as I said in the remarks, you know, one we do not comment on rumors, but today we are totally focused on the separation of KBR from Halliburton and I think that answers your question.
Q – Jim Wicklund: It does and again sorry guys, but I needed to do that thanks. That’s all I’ve got. Go ahead.
Operator: We will go next to James Crandell of Lehman Brothers.
Q – James Crandell: I just want to ask another question on rumors per se that acquisition strategy and as you look at your company now that KBR is being put into an IPO here and you got all these problems of the company in the past behind you. Do you feel the need or desire for more scale in your oil service business and would you describe your acquisition strategy in oil field service as niche focus or willing to consider something large?
A - Christopher Gaut: Jim, we are very pleased with the prospects that we have for our portfolio of businesses. We have been more active in the acquisitions arena during 2005 and we pronounced a handful of deals here in the past several months. We will continue to look for acquisitions that have technology, that compliment our existing product line, or possibly that provides greater geographic balance in certain areas. Those are the kinds of things that we have been most focused on.
Q – James Crandell: Okay, and as a follow-up question. Andy, could I ask you to comment on the rate of price improvement in the US simulation market in the recent quarter of percentage gain with the rate of improvement relevant to the past two to three quarters in pricing and then get your reaction below the capacity coming on the market and what that portents for the business you are going forward?
A – Andrew Lane: Yes Jim, in 2005 we had some success in early 2005 in getting the late 2004 price working increases through, increasingly better success in the second half of 2005 with the most in the fourth quarter.
A - Christopher Gaut: Yeah. The market still is very tight and we see a lot of room for our still upward pricing. There is a lot of shortages of people, shortages of cementing, shortages of crack popping, sand and overall shortages of personnel have created, is still a very tight margin. So, we still see a very good fundamental market on supply capacity of shortages to increase pricing in 2006.
Q – James Crandell: My sense Andy is, you been a reasonably aggressive in increasing your domestic simulation capacity perhaps it is less than 25% last year and not going forward. Is that a reasonable estimate?
A – Andrew Lane: We have not given Jim the details on how much for competitive reasons, how much we have passed foot into North America specifically, but it is a very strong performance for us and it will be a large part of our capital investment in 2006.
Q – James Crandell: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Scott Gill from Simmons and Company.
Q – Scott Gill: Yes, good morning gentlemen and kind of along those lines Andy or Chris or Dave, you are looking at increasing your capital spends of 2006 fairly significantly, can you give us some color in detail on the increase in which product service line is going to get the majority or the components of that capital spend?
A - Christopher Gaut: Scott, we not breaking us down again for competitive reasons but some of the divisions that we feel can really benefit from an increased allocation of resources would include our directional drilling business. We talked about the extending capacity in drill bits. Certainly in our pressure pumping businesses, Andy spoke to the North American side and then outside North America. We are looking at growth in such areas, that Dave mentioned, I with the Middle East, North Africa, and Russia. We previously talked about a significant increase in our role there and I think those are some of the focused areas for us, Andy, anything you want to add?
Q – Andrew Lane: The big ones pumping services and Sperry downhole tools are main emphasis.
Q – Scott Gill: Okay, and as my follow-up as you look at your capital spending budget for 2006 and you start assessing your various suppliers, are you seeing any tightness in the market that put that budget at risk, in other words you may not be able to spend your $800 million?
A – David Lesar: This is Dave, let me answer that. I think that in especially in our critical pressure pumping markets we are the only big pressure pumping company that historically integrated and that we still manufacture our own pressure pumping equipment and I think that actually gives us a real advantage today in being able to react to the marketplace because most of our competitors are really going to a single vendor and have to set a figure on how and when to get into the queue for equipment going forward where we can ramp up and down our manufacturing facilities very quickly to meet the demands that we see out there, so from that standpoint I think that we actually have a big competitive advantage in this marketplace. I think if you look at certain components for drilling tools and some of the others, certainly there are issues in backlogging of certain items there but generally I think we feel we can bring them into the market at the pace that we want them.
Q – Scott Gill: Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Dan Pickering at Pickering Energy Partners.
Q – Dan Pickering: Good morning guys. I was wondering if you could address the North American side, revenues up roughly 2%, I am just curious how that fits with your expectations, I guess, thinking about pricing improvements, return improvements. I thought that number might be a bit higher. Where there any lumps in the third quarter or the fourth quarter?
A – David Lesar: Yes Dan, it was a very strong quarter for us in October, November. We had some tail-off in December primarily in the Rockies related to the logistics of moving equipment around and the weather and where we were working in the Rockies on the certain projects. So, that impact us a little bit and there was a slight slowdown at the end of December in Canada, just slowdown in overall activity, but again we were very strong in October, November and we feel very good about going into the first quarter. You have your normal seasonal weather impact that you have to live with in Canada and the Rockies, but overall we feel very good about the quarter.
A - Christopher Gaut: Keep in mind Dan, when we think about the comps, the sequential comps of the third quarter, we also had a very strong third quarter in North America, we topped that in the fourth quarter, some seasonality there and weather factors in December.
Q – Dan Pickering: Okay, great. And then I guess as we look into 2006, particularly in the first quarter, as you look at whether you want to talk about it geographically or by business segment, we all understand seasonal fourth to first quarter issues in the Landmark business, but is there any reason to think that any of your other segments as we move into Q1 should show any revenue or margin slowdown relative to Q4?
A – Andrew Lane: Well Dan, I think the only other thing that I would say Landmark of course is a big impact as it always is and the first quarter is a drop-off from its great fourth quarter of the more significant this year because of the very strong performance Landmark delivered. You will see a drop-off in direct sales and DFE that we have talked about in the $30 million range. We have weather impacts in the Rockies that we talked about. North Sea and Russia is experiencing an extremely cold winter. So, we expect to see all that hit us in the first quarter.
Q – Dan Pickering: Does that aggregate in your mind to improvement in overall revenue or decline?
A - Christopher Gaut: We are not providing guidance Dan, but there are some puts and takes there and obviously this is January. The overall trends remain in place as we have been saying throughout this call. There are some places where there is some seasonality.
Q – Dan Pickering: Thanks very much.
Operator: We will take our next question from Robin Schumacher with Bear Stearns.
Q - Robin Schumacher: Yes. Thank you. I wanted to ask your views on cost structure and cost of operations, oilfield inflation etc., particularly just with respect to your 48% incremental margins in oil services in 2005, with the cost pressures you are experiencing is that an achievable kind of incremental margin in 2006 or should we think of something perhaps lower than that as an achievable target?
A – David Lesar: Robin, I will just talk in general terms about what we see in pricing. We as you know, the labor market is very tight. We see our historical annual increasing labor cost. In the second quarter we normally do that adjustment. We still see tightness in cements, we see tightness in some specialty chemicals that we use in operations, definitely in materials and steels, and tools, the main drivers for pressure on cost increases, but we will push pricing, we will push pricing very hard through 2006 and that is our plan.
Q - Robin Schumacher: 14%, that’s a big number. Right, understood. So, just as related, in the things that may have held back your margins a bit in 2005 from what even the very good margins achieved would have been as I think of the Mexico turnkey project and the hurricane impact primarily, which presumably wouldn’t impact you in 2006?
A - Christopher Gaut: Good point. Good point.
Q – Robin Schumacher: Okay. Thank you.
A - Christopher Gaut: Mexico has been depressing our results the whole year, not only taking some losses, but then in another quarters, like this quarter having zero margin contributions from that work.
Q – Robin Schumacher: Right. Thank you.
Operator: We will go next to Michael Urban at Deutsche Bank.
Q - Michael Urban: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to go little more into the pricing trends. I’m wondering if you could quantify or at least differentiate where you are seeing better or worse price increases? And then also if you have an idea what the interest is going to be, actually getting to we are getting to where if any, is there going to be laggers or disappointments that are now showing better price increases?
A - Christopher Gaut: Certainly North America as we were saying quite strong, and then of course the Middle East, the Gulf and Asia. I think the offshore markets have come along quite well. If we would think about where we might have some laggers in terms of price they are probably parts of Latin America, outside of Brazil, and working with national companies too, those are going to be longer contracts and so there is some lag there as well and then in probably parts of Southeast Asia, we also have longer-term contracts there and depending on the competitive dynamics in a particular country, and whether rigs are going or coming, we have a probably particular markets there, particular countries where we have some flatter areas there.
Q - Michael Urban: And how about on a product line basis, anything that’s continuing to not get as much price gain you might like or were you suddenly seen a pick-up off late?
A - Christopher Gaut: Probably, the only CSO now that it does not have pricing that is higher than the 2001 peak is logging. It is just going to lag it from a pricing standpoint, I think for the industry as a whole.
Q - Michael Urban: Any particular driver that you think is causing that or anything that might change?
A – Andrew Lane: Well, Mike, I think logging as a whole we have had some very good job in the last year in improving the possibility. We remain in a less than advantageous market share position. So we are not the pricing leader in logging by far so, but they have done very well in logging. We also would like to see very well to accelerate and at even faster pace that’d be the other area I’d mentioned.
Q - Michael Urban: Great. Thank you.
Operator: We are going next to Ken Sill at Credit Suisse.
Q – Ken Sill: Yeah. Good morning guys. I know you do not want to provide guidance, but if you going to IPO KBR, may be you could help us a little bit here. You know, obviously great source of positive surprise, but just looking at the numbers you are seeing, the revenue for Iraq declined in 2006 is going to be more dramatic than 2005 and yet the revenues were up in the fourth quarter, so should we see that tail-off kind of ratably as we move through 2006 from Iraq?
A – David Lesar: Yes Ken, I think we will. We have the uptick in revenue in Q4 because we were charged with purchasing some long lead-time items with the military. We expected it to be a consistent decline over 2006 and you have read as we have increasing talk from Washington about reducing troop counts ahead of the congressional election and the term elections later this year that may have an impact on the timing of the true production. So that’s probably a biggest driver overall is the troop count, as well as they move more towards sustainment in building a new facility.
Q – Ken Sill: And the margin should remain pretty strong in government or in Iraq in the first place there is going to be some more award fees get booked, so continuing in the 3% plus?
A – David Lesar: Well don’t know about that Ken. We had some settlements here in 2005 and as we said this morning, we’ve made very good progress on settling the big issues here and the LOGCAP contract is probably in a more than 2% to 3% margin contract overall.
Q – Ken Sill: And then energy and chemical, I noticed, you know, the backlog was down just slightly, the revenues were up nicely, you are talking about 5% plus margins there. Is the LNG and petrochemical stuff is coming on is going to kind of ramp-up and result in better revenue 2006 or is 2006 kind of a transition year where it is going to flattish relative to 2005, because you had a really good fourth quarter in that business?
A – David Lesar: Yeah. We see that business is continuing to grow and we are rolling off some revenue of these older oil and gas facilities contract at very low margins and rolling on these gas monetization contracts that carry and contribute a higher margin. So, that is going to be a better fit in 2006 and based on our plans and the increase in backlog, I think that is a pretty good indicator of where we feel that business going.
Q – Ken Sill: Okay, is there going to be any seasonality Q4 to Q1 in that business like we have seen in some prior years or is that just been a normal trend down and you kind of bottom going the other way now?
A – David Lesar: Well I do not expect to see any seasonality on the E&C business.
Q – Ken Sill: Okay.
A - Evelyn Angelle: Dustin, we are through running short on time, so lets take one more question.
Operator: Okay. We will take our last question from Kurt Hallead, RBC Capital Markets.
Q - Kurt Hallead: Hi, good morning. A question to relate to whether or not you guys are seeing any differential pushback from your customers with respect to the price increases, whether or not your North American customer base, whether or not you see any nervousness or skittishness as it relates this seasonal downtick in the natural gas price?
A – David Lesar: This is Dave, let me answer that because I spend a lot of time with our customers and it is really the pushback we get is not on pricing, its getting the equipment and get it for me now that I have got drilling commitments, I have got rigs leased and I need you guys there especially in the stimulation market where they will pay in premium for the type of work we do. So, the pushback really is we need more investments. We are asking for a longer term commitments, but with more flexibility on pricing and in the number of cases we are getting that. So I think that we see that the supply-demand balance is still in the favor of the service companies and that’s how we believe we can continue to bring equipment into the marketplace and at the same time increase our prices.
Q - Kurt Hallead: And, you are not getting any sense of any nervousness at all about this seasonal shift in natural gas price?
A – David Lesar: No, not at this point.
Q - Kurt Hallead: Right. That’s it. I will follow-up offline. Thanks.
Evelyn Angelle, Vice President of Investor Relations: I’d like to thank everyone for joining us today. If others have additional questions, please feel free to call me today and that concludes our call this afternoon. Thank you.
Operator: And that concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2005 Q3  (2005-11-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to today's Halliburton Company Third Quarter 2005 Results Conference Call.  This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Evelyn Angelle.  Please go ahead.
Evelyn Angelle: Good morning, and welcome to Halliburton's third quarter 2005 earnings release conference call.  Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available on our website for seven days.  Joining me today are Dave Lesar, Chairman, President, and CEO; Chris Gaut, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Andy Lane, Executive Vice President and COO. The press release announcing our third quarter results is available on our website at www.halliburton.com.  It estimates the impact the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes had on different parts of our business.  Overall the hurricanes negatively impacted our third quarter net income by $0.05 per diluted share. We have tentatively scheduled our 2005 fourth quarter earnings release conference call,  Friday, January 27, 2006, at 9:00 a.m. central standard time.  In today's call, Dave will provide opening remarks.  Chris will discuss our overall operating performance and financial results followed by Andy covering strategy and our business outlook.  We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks. Before turning the call over to Dave, I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements, reflecting the Company's view about future events and their potential impact on our performance.  These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company's operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements.  These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2005, and recent current reports on Forms 8-K. Now I will turn the call over to our CEO, Dave Lesar.  Dave.
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Evelyn, and good morning everyone.  I'm pleased to record another quarter of solid financial performance at Halliburton.  Despite the Gulf of Mexico's pretax impact from the hurricanes of proximately $33 million, we achieved record consolidated operating income of $690 million.  While the situation in the Gulf has claimed everyone's attention, in reality the hurricanes are only a small part of the news we will share with you this morning. First of all, regardless of what you may read in the papers, we did not do any work for FEMA.  In fact, as of today, KBR's hurricane-related work is less than $200 million and is being done under the competitively bid CONCAP contract. In the ESG, I'm happy to report that not only did we achieve record revenues in operating income, but we also posted an operating income margin of 21.8%.  Part of this is attributable to the price increases we have implemented in the past.  I also announced in September additional price increases beginning this month.  These will range from 6 to 18% depending on the product line and Andy will give you more details on those in a moment. We also continue to benefit from our strong focus on return on capital.  This is being demonstrated by our fixed or exit strategy, where we are focusing our attention on our lowest performing areas in order to continue driving up our margins and returns by getting better terms from our customers or by exiting the market and taking that equipment to areas where we see higher returns.  This has a short-term impact on a region's revenue and cost as we demobilize and remobilize that equipment, but I believe that it is in ESG's best interest in the long run and Andy will give you more details on that in a moment. At KBR, revenue is strong, margins have improved and we have landed some exciting new contracts, including new awards for LNG, and gas-to-liquid products that are strengthening our backlog and portfolio.  This quarter also, as expected, we had successful resolution of some of our fuel issues under the Rio contracts.  We have settled six of the ten task orders under review with no decrease in the amount of costs we will be reimbursed by the government.  We have also monetized an investment we had in a toll road we constructed a number of years ago.  Our only disappointment this quarter at KBR were some losses incurred in our E&C operations in Algeria.  You will hear more about those in a moment. I would also like to mention that we have and continue to make, strategic investments in the U.S. to take advantage of this strong market, just as we said we would.  This has strengthened our returns and is helping us build for growth in the rest of the world.  It now seems even the skeptics have changed their view of the continued strength of the North American market. Now, let's turn to Chris for the financial highlights and then Andy will come in with some more operational details.
Chris Gaut: Thanks, Dave and good morning.  I will comment on the overall company and individual segment results.  I will summarize the change in revenue and then operating income for each of our six segments and then discuss our liquidity and other financial matters.  In my remarks, I will be comparing third quarter of 2005 results sequentially to the second quarter of 2005. Halliburton Company revenue was $5.1 billion in Q3, essentially flat from the prior quarter.  Energy service group revenue was up $126 million, or 5% sequentially with three of the four ESG divisions setting new revenue records.  KBR revenue went down 7% sequentially primarily due to reduced activity on the competitively bid LogCAP contract in Iraq.  On a consolidated basis, international revenue was 72% of the total.  Halliburton achieved record operating income of $690 million for the third quarter. Overall, ESG operating income increased by $44 million reflecting a 70 basis point operating margin increase.  This was driven by higher natural gas drilling activity and continued pricing strength for our services, particularly in North America, where the market continues to be exceptionally strong. KBR operating income increased 23% in the third quarter to $150 million, operating margins rose by 150 basis points to 6%, with the sale of an interest in the U.S. toll road contributing $85 million to operating income, partially offset by losses and project joint ventures in Algeria. Now, I will highlight the ESG segment results.  Beginning with production optimization, where revenues increased $61 million or 6% compared to the second quarter of 2005.  Production enhancement led the segment with a 14% increase due to high demand in U.S. land for stimulation services and a strong rebound in Canada.  Completion tools revenue decreased 10% due to effects of the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, the large second quarter sales into Asia, and the completion of a large project in Mortania last quarter. Production optimization operating income increased sequentially 7% or $18 million with a 40 basis point improvement in margins.  In production enhancement, operating income grew 22% and margins continued to benefit from improved pricing and increased equipment utilization in the U.S. and Canada and lower cost due to a change in mix in Algeria.  However, completion tools operating income decreased 26%, largely reflecting the negative impact of the hurricanes and lower sales for the quarter. In the fluid systems segment, revenue increased $32 million or 5% over the second quarter of 2005.  Cementing revenue increased 4% primarily driven by better pricing in the U.S., land, and strengthened activity in Canada.  Third quarter results were negatively impacted by the hurricanes in the Gulf Coast, and decreased activity in Mexico. Baroid revenue increase by 5% reflecting activity and pricing increases in Western Africa and in the U.S. In addition, the rebound from the Canadian spring breakup contributed to Baroid revenue improvement.  The hurricanes damaged or temporarily halted operations at several of our cementing and Baroid facilities in Louisiana many of which have already come back online. Fluid systems operating income was up $4 million or 3% sequentially with continued margin strength.  Cementing services operating income increased 3% and Baroid operating income increased 2% due to the same factors that drove revenue.  Our drilling information evaluation segment had a revenue increase of $22 million or 4% sequentially of which 59% came from international operations. Sperry Drilling Services grew revenue by 7% due to a robust Canadian market and strong activity in the U.S., the Middle East, and the North Sea.  Security DBS increased revenue 13%, driven primarily by Canada, the U.S. and the North Sea.  The logging services revenue declined sequentially due to higher direct sales in Asia in the prior quarter.  Partially offsetting this decline was increased activity in the U.S., and Latin America in logging. Drilling information evaluation operating income increased $3 million or 2% over the second quarter.  Sperry Drilling Services operating income increased 6% mainly due to increased activity in Canada, the U.S., and the Middle East.  Security DBS drill bits operating income increased 46%, driven by the strength in rig count in Canada, as well as increased activity in the U.S. and Europe/Africa.  Logging operating income decreased 16% due to the decline in direct sales in Asia. Drilling information evaluation margins remained essentially flat from the prior quarter despite the impact of the hurricanes which halted or delayed activity in operations and manufacturing facilities along the Gulf Coast.  Digital and consulting solutions segment revenue was up 7% compared to the second quarter of 2005, primarily due to sales in North Africa.  Digital and consulting solutions operating income increased $19 million or 119% compared to the second quarter of 2005.  The second quarter included a $15 million charge for the integrated solutions projects in Mexico. Now let's turn to the two KBR segments.  Government and infrastructure revenue for the third quarter of 2005 was $1.9 billion, compared to 2 billion in the second quarter.  The decrease resulted from lower activities and the LogCAP contract and at the DML shipyard in the UK. Government infrastructures operating income for the third quarter was $149 million, up $76 million or 104% over the second quarter.  The increase is primarily the result of $85 million in operating income on the sale of our interest in the toll road we built in the '90s outside Washington D.C. As part of our plans to develop various projects, we occasionally take an ownership interest in the constructed asset, such as a toll road or a railroad.  Our strategy is to monetize that ownership interest once the operation matures and the asset increases in value and this is what happened in the case of this toll road. This quarter, KBR revenue related to Iraq activities was $1.9 billion, operating income was $45 million resulting in an operating margin of 3.7%.  We recognized $24 million in income related to the favorable settlement of various Iraq-related audit issues, particularly fuel.  The second quarter included $29 million in Iraq-related award fees granted on definitized past quarters.  Nonetheless our cumulative operating margin on the Iraq-related activities over the past two and a half years is less than 2% of revenue. In the energy and chemical segment, revenue for the third quarter of 2005 was $614 million, compared to $653 million for the second quarter.  Operating income for the third quarter of 2005 was $1 million versus $49 million in the second quarter.  Operating income declined primarily as a result of a total of $70 million in losses on various projects in Algeria.  Approximately $47 million related to charges we took on an unconsolidated Algerian joint venture.  About half of this amount related to project losses and the other half was a write-down of our carrying value of the venture. Separately, from this joint venture we recognized 23 million in additional losses on a gas project in Algeria.  Outside of Algeria, E&C continued to have very strong results with the commencement of the new LNG and GTL projects, continued good performance on reimbursable oil gas production facilities and the completion of our work scope on the Belanak FPSO project in Indonesia. Now let's review other financial items.  General corporate expenses were 26 million in the third quarter, compared to 37 million in the second quarter of 2005.  The decrease was mainly due to reduced outside professional fees. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 20% which is lower than the 28% estimate we provided you last quarter.  The reason for the decline is similar to what we have seen during the first and second quarters of this year, the improving profitability of our domestic operations is causing our estimates of U.S. taxable income for 2005 to increase.  This allows us to use more of our tax losses and foreign tax credits than we previously estimated.  Utilization of these tax benefits has a direct positive impact on our cash flow. We are now estimating a 26% effective tax rate for 2005, compared to our estimate of 29% last quarter.  We had to adjust our third quarter tax rate down to get to a 26% tax rate for the nine month results.  And we expect about a 26% rate for the fourth quarter.  However, this may change as we now are in our budgeting and planning process for future years. If as a result of this process, our estimate of U.S. taxable income for future years increases significantly, we may record a large one-time favorable adjustment to our valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of 2005 which could result in a large reversal of income tax expense and a large positive income contribution.  Essentially this would be recognized in the tax deductions for the asbestos settlement that we were not able to benefit previously. In 2006, and thereafter, we continue to believe our effective tax rate will be back at our normal range of 36 to 38%.  I would also like to point out that our diluted weighted average shares outstanding increased to 525 million shares this quarter.  This caused additional dilution to our EPS of approximately $0.02.  The dilution was attributable to the significant increase of our stock price in the third quarter, the impact this had on our convertible notes, and employee stock options in the diluted EPS calculation. Generally, at this level, a $5 increase in our quarterly average stock price results in 1.6 million additional diluted shares.  As you know, we plan to adopt a new accounting standard on expensing employee stock options effective January 1 of 2006.  We expect this will result in $0.02 of additional ongoing quarterly expense starting next year. Now, let's turn to liquidity.  Cash and marketable securities were $2.1 billion at September 30, which is an increase of approximately $550 million from June 30, 2005.  Our debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 39% as of September 30, and last week we paid off the $300 million variable rate senior notes that matures this month.  Our September 30, 2005, debt-to-total capitalization ratio would have been 37%, including this debt reduction in October. We also had further improvement to our return on capital employed during Q3, which is now running at an annual rate of 25.3%, and that's a 260 basis point improvement from last quarter, and that includes 70 basis points related to income from the toll road sale.  We calculate return on capital employed differently from some other companies as we do not deduct our significant cash balance from capital employed. During Q3 our capital spending increased to meet the higher level of activity due to our customers' increase in E&P spending up about 25% versus the run rate in the first half.  We expect our CapEx to be in its higher range of 180 to $200 million per quarter into next year.  We are confident that we have planned for the appropriate level investment in 2006. Before turning it over to Andy, I will give you an update about the separation of KBR; as we announced in January, we believe it is necessary for KBR to deliver solid operating performance for a number of quarters to build KBR's backlog and to reduce uncertainty around the various disputes and investigations under way in order to maximize KBR's value for our shareholders.  We have made progress in these areas but no time line has been set for a separation of KBR.  In pursuing the potential operation of KBR, we will consider an initial public offering of KBR as well as private transactions. Andy?
Andy Lane: Thanks, Chris.  Good morning, everyone.  ESG turned in another record-setting quarter.  reflecting continued robust activity in the market.  The management team we have in place at the ESG is doing an excellent job in capitalizing on the current opportunities.  Our employees are working very hard and we continue to add direct resources to meet the improved demand. If you look at the first nine months of 2005, compared to this same period in 2004, we've had top line growth of over $1.4 billion, or 24%, and we've improved the operating income by over $700 million.  Our September ESG year-to-date margins were 22%.  We are proud of our management and our dedicated hard-working employees who delivered these great results. I will talk about each region in a moment but first I wanted to describe how the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico prevented us from having an even greater quarter.  Halliburton was relatively fortunate; nevertheless, we sustained heavy damages to both our Baroid and cementing Louisiana facilities in Cameron, Bennett and Intercoastal City.  We have shifted our activity to other facilities while those are being repaired and we are now ready to continue operations at the pre hurricane levels. As you know, some of our customers' platforms and rigs were damaged or lost and it will take them a while to reestablish pre hurricane activity levels.  We do expect customers to resume the activities that were curtailed by the storms throughout the end of the year, and into the first half of 2006.  Our Gulf of Mexico activity is about 70% of pre hurricane levels.  Meanwhile, we have deployed a number of our Gulf of Mexico personnel to higher utilization areas until activity levels resume.  The third quarter ESG hurricane impact of $0.04 per share is based on a mix of lower operational activity and temporary declines in manufacturing productivity. Looking forward to the fourth quarter of 2005, we expect a similar financial impact as seen in the third quarter, primarily due to lower operational activities, and the number of offshore rigs that are out of service.  I would like to thank all of our employees on the Gulf Coast to helping to secure our facilities, ensure the safety of our workers, and return our business to normal operations.  I also appreciate our employees worldwide who very generously helped take care of people who were displaced by the storms, by contributing to a Halliburton matching assistance fund. A positive contributor to this quarter's performance was improved pricing.  Since May of 2004, we have had three U.S. price book increases ranging from 8 to 15%.  We have announced an additional price increase effective October 15, in three divisions.  The increases are as follows: Production optimization 15%, in fluid systems, 10 to 18%, and in drilling and formation evaluation, 6 to 15%.  Our price increase in digital and consulting solutions will become effective January 1, 2006, and will be 5 to 9%. Beyond the U.S., we continue to improve our prices.  We are pushing for and have been successful with increases in new and existing contracts through direct negotiations and tendered opportunities.  We believe additional pricing opportunities exist in every region. Over the last six quarters, on average, our revenues have grown 8% per quarter in North America, and 5% per quarter in the rest of the world.  In North America, revenues increased 12% and operating income increased 20%.  We continue to focus on pricing improvements, disciplined capital deployment, control of operating costs, and efficient use of our existing capital base while maintaining our leadership position in the U.S. land.  This substantial improvement in our productivity reflects improved pricing and better utilization of our equipment.  For example, our revenue for U.S. crack crew has grown 65% in the last six quarters.  These efforts mitigated the effects of the Gulf of Mexico. Canada experienced strong growth sequentially as activity levels improved from weather-related slowdowns in the second quarter.  In Latin America, margins improved in Mexico, where we improved our operational performance on our integrated drilling projects for Pemex.  We are encouraged that recent performance gains will be carried through the remainder of the project which we expect to conclude in April of 2006. We continue to focus on improved results in certain areas of Latin America to meet our performance expectations.  In our Middle East and Asia region, revenue was down 5% and operating income was down 12%, partly as a result of lower direct sales to certain countries, and the deployment of resources to growing markets. In the third quarter, we mobilized additional service equipment and personnel to meet the overall rig and E&P investment we are experiencing in the Middle East.  We are well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.  We expect to see improved results in this area in 2006, led by Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Malaysia. In our Europe/Africa CIS region, revenues were up 4% and operating income was down 4%.  We saw improved probability in the rapidly growing Russia and Caspian markets.  This demonstrates our commitment to growing in these markets while maximizing our return on investments.  Activity picked up in Northern Africa where our revenues were up as we broaden our customer base.  West Africa is another growth area in the deep water market and our well dynamics joint venture won several intelligent well contracts in Angola, expanding our strong position in completions in West Africa. We continue efforts to meet local content goals in Nigeria, which should help to improve our margins there.  We are also focused on our fix it or exit strategy for improving financial performance in operations throughout Europe and Africa.  In the North Sea, profitabilities declined because of product mix and rig scheduling.  So overall for ESG in the third quarter I'm very pleased with our results, again.  For the fourth quarter, notwithstanding the seasonal impact and the continued effects of the Gulf of Mexico, we remain positive. Now, let's turn to KBR.  Looking at the first nine months, revenue is down $1.5 billion, or 16%, primarily due to the completion of the Rio contract and the ramp down of LogCAP work in Iraq, as well as the completion of certain E&C products.  The KBR operating income for the same nine-month period has increased by over $700 million, a significant improvement.  But we still have work to do. We continue to focus on profitability, the quality of backlogs, and resolving outstanding issues regarding government contracts, and investigations.  KBR's total backlog at the end of September was 14.3 billion.  With our G&I, within our G&I segment, we expect the volume of work on the LogCAP 3 contract to continue to decline into 2006.  As our customer scales back the amount of services that KBR provides. We are pleased with our progress we have made in resolving over $1 billion in issues related to fuel services under the Rio contract.  We have favorably settled the majority of the task orders affected by this issue and have forecast orders still under negotiation of which three are fuel related.  Fuel was our second major dispute to resolve.  As you will remember, we settled facilities in the second quarter.  The G&I backlog at the end of the quarter was $3.6 billion in firm orders, an additional $3.9 billion in government orders are firm, but are not yet funded or the letters of intent or contracts have been awarded but not yet signed. In E&C, we've had significant gas monetization wins this quarter.  A major contract award was from Yemen LNG Company Limited for the first LNG plant in Yemen..  Another important new contract is for a payout of lump sum turnkey price for an LNG facility to be located in Peru.  This grass roots facility will be Latin America's first LNG export plant.  And finally we were awarded the project management work for Qatar Shell GTL Limited Pearl project in Qatar.  It will be the largest gas to liquids plant in the world.  This is our second major GTL project win in 2005 and positioned us well in this emerging market. Our E&C backlog at the end of the third quarter was 6.8 billion.  Approximately half of this is from our industry leading gas monetization projects.  We are actively pursuing 11 new LNG liquefaction plants for 2006 and 2007 awards.  We are disappointed in Algerian losses in E&C.  To address these issues we will be more selective about what kind of work we take on in Algeria in the future. For example, some of the losses the unconsolidated venture has experienced are related to infrastructure projects such as hospitals and government buildings.  So we don't plan to participate in those type of projects in Algeria in the future.  The second major loss was with a gas plant that will be completed in May of 2006.  This is a plant where we have filed a major site relocation claim and it's currently going through arbitration. In conclusion, let me say a few words about our industry outlook and the roles I think ESG and KBR will play.  This quarter the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico had a dramatic impact on activities, and among other things focused attention on America's shortage of refining capacity. During the quarter, we began discussing the first significant refinery expansion in the U.S. in the last 20 years.  If and when refineries are built, KBR will be in good position to compete for this business.  Similarly if more LNG regasification terminals are to be built in the U.S, KBR is the engineering industry leader in designing these terminals, we'll be well positioned in that market as well.  KBR is involved in nearly all aspects of the LNG value chain from onshore and offshore gas production facilities to liquefaction plants and regasification terminals.  We are optimistic about KBR's continued growth and success in future gas developments, LNG and GTL projects. For the ESG none of the events of this quarter have changed our positive view of the future.  Oil and gas prices will fluctuate but all the evidence indicates higher E&P spending by our customers around the world through next year.  Therefore the demand for our energy services will continue to be robust, particularly those services that reduce drilling time and increase production rates.  We believe E&C spending will remain strong due to increased demand for energy.  The positive industry outlook will not cause us to change our strategy of cost containment, capital discipline, and a focus on profits. Now, I will turn the call back over to Dave Lesar for a closing comment.  Dave?
Dave Lesar: Thank you, Andy.  You can see we remain very bullish and optimistic about where the industry is, and the future in terms of customer spending.  Our company has obviously endured a lot of challenges in the past year, including resolving asbestos, getting the election behind us, and our learning experience on Barricuda.  But that's behind us now.  Today we're going about our daily business of focusing on higher profits and returns for our shareholders.  And we are moving forward with quarter after quarter of financial improvements.  I think that the management team feels good to get back to some semblance of life being normal. Now we'll take your questions.  We ask you to limit to one question, and one follow-up per caller.  Thank you.
